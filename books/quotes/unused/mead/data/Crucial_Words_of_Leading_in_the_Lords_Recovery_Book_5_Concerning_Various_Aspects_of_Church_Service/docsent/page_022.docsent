   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Having No Choice in the Work</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After I entered the work of the Lord s recovery, I never chose where to work.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I simply did as I was told.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Wherever the work sent me, I went.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Most of the time I was sent to a place where the work was experiencing difficulty, but by the Lord s mercy I never made my own choices.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Wherever the work sent me, I went.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the work sent me to Taiwan, another brother was sent to assist me with the Hok-kien dialect.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, this brother did not come to Taiwan, because he felt that Taiwan was backward.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many years later I went to America and stayed with Brother Samuel Chang for a time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I had much fellowship with him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He told me that when I was laboring in mainland China, some of the workers thought that I was rather na ve concerning the work, because I went wherever I was told to go, and I did whatever I was asked to do.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the attitude that we should have.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We hope that we will all learn to be na ve in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The wife of Brother Abraham Chang lived in Shanghai and helped with the literature work in 1940.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>She can testify that I was indeed rather na ve.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I did not speak much, unless I was giving a message.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You would not hear my voice in the co-workers meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Coming to labor in Taiwan was the right thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>More Chinese people congregate in Taiwan than anywhere else.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>None of the other countries Hong Kong, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, or Thailand can match Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Taiwan is the best place for the work, and it is greatly blessed by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No one can deny this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thirty years ago no one would choose to come to Taiwan, but today the churches here are being blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No human hand could accomplish this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It was accomplished by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>NOT HAVING FOLLOWERS</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not have a group of followers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every business requires its employees to be followers, but we in the Lord s recovery must not have a following.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I do not have a following.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Wherever I go, I am with the local saints.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the Lord took me from Chefoo to Shanghai, I did not take a following with me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The saints who assisted me and coordinated with me spoke the Shanghai dialect.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When I went to America, I did not have a following.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I did not take a co-worker from Taiwan, and I did not use any co-worker from Taiwan, because what was useful in Taiwan might not have been useful in America.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Taking a group of followers from Taiwan to America would have been a hindrance.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we have a group of followers when we labor in the schools, we will take our followers with us when we are reassigned to work in the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we are reassigned from one area of service to another, we should go by ourselves and not take any followers with us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This has become a common problem among us: wherever we work, we take a group of followers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>NOT HAVING NATURAL RELATIONSHIPS</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A group of followers is an indication that we have natural relationships with others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In our service we cannot have natural relationships with others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should not have a group of saints with whom we agree in taste and temperament.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is poison.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those who have a natural relationship discuss everything with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Chinese describe such close friendships as breathing through the same nostrils.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord sent the disciples out two by two, but He did not allow them to have natural relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even though Peter, John, and James were always together, in John 21 the Lord told Peter, When you were younger, you girded yourself and walked where you wished; but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go v. 18 . In verse 21 Peter asked what John s future would be, and the Lord replied, If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow Me v. 22 . The Lord s response implied that they must not have anything natural among them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the Roman Empire was persecuting the believers, Peter, John, and James were not martyred together.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>James was martyred first and then Peter, but John was exiled to the island of Patmos.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although we are brothers and sisters and members one of another, there should never be a situation of natural relationships among us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many corrupt things come out of natural relationships.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The points of this fellowship are to inoculate us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Please remember these points.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As we continue in the Lord, these things will be manifested among us, not only in the younger serving ones but also in the older serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>BEING A PURE PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need to learn the lesson to be a pure person, that is, a person who trusts in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We also need to learn to be simple members in Christ s Body, knowing only the Body and the Head, not having our own clique, not having any natural relationship, and not having any following.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A following is a little sect.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should not have a following in our own locality, nor should we have a following in other localities.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our co-workers are the co-workers of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When I come to Taiwan, the co-workers in Taiwan are my co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When I am in America, the co-workers there are my co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When I go to Germany, the co-workers there are my co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is the same when I go to Brazil.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I have so many co-workers because I do not have a following of co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Instead, all the co-workers are my co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Having a following shows that we are sick and divisive, that is, sectarian.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This principle applies in one locality and in many localities.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Those who have a heart to serve the Lord should learn this lesson from their youth.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They should learn not to have a competitive, comparing spirit but a pure spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They should be willing to serve the Lord and give the Lord an outlet.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We thank the Lord when He blesses Hong Kong, and we thank Him when He blesses Yungho.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We are here learning our weaknesses and also learning from the strengths of others.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is to have a right spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If there are small groups that do well in the future, we all must learn from their strong points and their merits.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If the children s work does well, we also need to learn from the children s work.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We should never compete or be jealous over one another, nor should we have our own choice.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is only in this way that we can maintain the Lord s blessing and maintain our longevity in the Lord s service.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We need to be kept by the Lord; otherwise, we will not last in the service.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We must learn these lessons every day so that we can remain in the Lord s work and allow Him to use us to bring His blessing.</S>
