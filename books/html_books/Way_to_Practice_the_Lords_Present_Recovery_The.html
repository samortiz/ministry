<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p> This small book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee to the elders and co-workers from December 31, 1988 through January 2, 1989 in Irving, Texas.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>

<h1 class="title">PRACTICING THE NEW WAY TO BUILD UP<br />
THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 14</h1>
<p>In this book we want to fellowship concerning our need to pick up the new way to practice the Lord&rsquo;s present recovery. In order to meet the Lord&rsquo;s present need, we must enter into two portions of His Word: 1 Corinthians 14 and Ephesians 4:11-16.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CRUCIAL REVELATION IN 1 CORINTHIANS 14</h2>
<p>We want to begin our fellowship by studying 1 Corinthians 14. The subject of this chapter of forty verses is not only prophesying but also the encouragement to prophesy. In verse 1 Paul says, &ldquo;Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.&rdquo; This verse shows that we need to have an earnest desire to prophesy. In verse 5 he says, &ldquo;I desire...that you may prophesy.&rdquo; Then in verse 12 he says, &ldquo;Seek that you may excel to the building up of the church.&rdquo; To prophesy is to excel because &ldquo;he who prophesies builds up the church&rdquo; (v. 4). The gift of prophesying is an excelling gift. All the other gifts are not as high or excelling. In verse 39 Paul says, &ldquo;Therefore, my brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy.&rdquo; From these verses we can see that the Apostle Paul is encouraging, charging, and urging us to prophesy. After covering many items in the first thirteen chapters of 1 Corinthians, Paul encourages us in chapter fourteen to seek this excelling gift for the building up of the church.</p>
<p>To prophesy in 1 Corinthians 14 is not in the sense of foretelling or predicting. To prophesy is to speak for the Lord, and in our speaking for the Lord, we have to speak forth the Lord and speak the Lord into others. To prophesy is to dispense the very Christ whom we have experienced into others. The subject of 1 Corinthians 14 is prophesying, which is speaking Christ forth into others, dispensing Christ into others by our speaking. This is not human or ordinary speaking but divine and extraordinary speaking.</p>
<p>According to verse 2 of chapter one, 1 Corinthians was written not only to the church in Corinth but also to &ldquo;all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, theirs and ours.&rdquo; This Epistle is to us. It is an Epistle to all the local churches. First Corinthians is a book on Christ as our portion, so verse 2 refers to Christ as being &ldquo;theirs and ours.&rdquo; Christ is their portion and our portion. He is the portion of all His believers. A believer in Christ should be an enjoyer of Christ, a caller on Christ. Our calling on Him is to receive Him, to breathe Him in, to enjoy Him, and to take Him as our portion for our daily practical needs. Every day and every minute, we need this Christ as our support, as our supply, so we have to call on Him all the time. To exercise our spirit to call &ldquo;O Lord Jesus&rdquo; is our spiritual breathing. By this kind of breathing, we receive the life supply and the enjoyment of Christ to live Christ. We live Christ by calling on Him as our portion.</p>
<p>In the first two chapters of 1 Corinthians, we can see the enjoyment of Christ as our portion. In chapter three the growth in life is revealed (vv. 6-7). First Corinthians shows us that when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus to enjoy Him, this enjoyment issues in the growth in life. Little children grow by their eating, their enjoyment, of the proper food. If a child eats a lot for three years, but there is no evidence of his growth, something must be wrong. The eating, the enjoyment of food, issues in the growth in life. Furthermore, many of the problems that we have in our physical bodies can be solved by eating the proper food. The life supply that we get from the healthy food kills many germs within us. We may enjoy the taste of good food without realizing that we were taking in many antibiotics. While the food is nourishing us, it is also killing germs and healing us to give us the best health. Our physical strength comes from the nourishing food that we eat. Our eating of the nourishing food issues in the growth in life so that the problems within our physical body may be solved. In like manner, the growth in the divine life comes from our eating, from our enjoyment, of Christ. Because we eat Christ and enjoy Him, we grow, and as we grow, we heal ourselves. By the end of chapter eleven of 1 Corinthians many spiritual diseases have been covered. These diseases are healed by the enjoyment of Christ that issues in the growth in life.</p>
<p>Beginning in chapter twelve, Paul introduces another subject. This subject is related to our function. A healthy body not only grows but also functions. The more a child eats, the more he grows, and the more he grows, the more he functions. A newborn babe has ears, eyes, hands, and legs, but without the adequate growth, these members will not be able to function adequately. There is the need of development, and the development comes from the growth. Eating issues in the growth, and the growth develops all the parts of our body in their functions. A newborn babe cannot see clearly, but after a few months he is able to see. The seeing comes by the development of his seeing organ through the growth in life. First Corinthians shows us that we need to feed on Christ, to get the nourishment, to enjoy Him. It is a practical matter of life for us to enjoy Christ. Then we will grow and our function will be developed. Every member has its own function, but in the Body of Christ the top function is to speak for Christ, to prophesy.</p>
<p>First Corinthians firstly shows us Christ as our portion for us to enjoy. Out from this enjoyment comes the growth, and the growth serves to develop our spiritual organs. The functions of these organs are for the building up of the Body. Thus, 1 Corinthians eventually consummates in the building up of the church. It reveals to us that the final result of enjoying Christ is neither the growth in life nor the development of the gifts, but the building up of the Body, the church. Therefore, 1 Corinthians is a book on Christ and the church. Christ can be enlarged and extended by our enjoying of Him. This enjoying of Him issues in the growth in life, and the growth in life brings in much development. As we grow physically, every member and organ of our body is fully developed. Then our entire physical body with every member is functioning, and this functioning has one goal&mdash;to build up our body. The functioning of the organs and members of our physical body equals the building up of our body. The more we exercise, work, move, and function, the more our body is built up. Similarly, the functioning of the members of the Body of Christ is the building up of the Body. The more the members of the Body of Christ function, the more the Body is built up.</p>
<p>In Christ&rsquo;s Body the excelling organ is the speaking organ. Paul, however, strongly belittles the gift of speaking in tongues and exalts the gift of prophecy to the uttermost. To build up the Body of Christ, the excelling function or gift is prophecy. In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul concentrates on prophesying. To prophesy is to excel, to place us at the highest point in the building up of the Body of Christ. In the building up of the Body of Christ, prophesying is the top function.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEW WAY TO BUILD UP THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>When I returned to Taipei in 1984, I was burdened of the Lord to find out a new, scriptural way for us to meet and to serve for the building up of the Body of Christ. By October of 1984, I had a deep and clear realization that all of Christianity had nearly come to a standstill. Statistics showed that some of the major denominations were decreasing in number. Whereas the increase in Christianity had been very low, the Moslems and the Buddhists had much increase. We had also come nearly to a standstill in our increase. This fact greatly burdened me for our situation in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I went to Taipei to do some research, some experimental work.</p>
<p>At the very beginning of my study, I found out that for the church to grow up with the proper increase, there is the need for the proper preaching of the gospel. To have the increase in life we need to beget many new ones. If we stop begetting, we will be terminated. If the human race did not have the element of begetting, it would be terminated within a short amount of time. The factor of begetting has kept the human race going on from one man whose name was Adam to billions of people. Begetting is the base of the Lord&rsquo;s move. Without begetting for the increase and spread of the church, we cannot build up anything. Within ten years beginning in 1974, I observed that the churches in Orange County, California had very little increase. Moreover, by 1984 the church in Taipei had decreased in number over the previous twenty years. How can we talk about the building up of the church when we are not begetting or multiplying? I realized that we had to sacrifice something and suffer some loss initially in order to take the new way, but what was the use of remaining in the old way in the same unfruitful state? We needed to sacrifice something to find out some new way. For the Lord to have a proper way out of the denominational traditions, we must take care of four crucial steps: gospel preaching, home meetings, group meetings, and church meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Preaching the Gospel<br />
by Visiting People in Their Homes</h2>
<p>The proper preaching of the gospel is not at all according to the traditional way. I hate tradition to the uttermost because I fully realize that it has greatly damaged and killed many of us without our awareness. Day after day, week after week, month after month, and year after year, the evil one, Satan, has been using tradition to slaughter and annul us. Tradition is oldness, and oldness is staleness. Oldness, staleness, and tradition are synonyms. The practice of degraded Christianity, which we to some extent still retain, has become stale. This was the reason that I paid a great price to return to Taiwan in 1984 and stay there for a period of time.</p>
<p>While I was there, I was before the Lord day and night concerning what He wanted to do. I was considering the way to carry out the proper preaching of the gospel that was outside of tradition and according to God&rsquo;s ordained way revealed in the Bible. I believe that the Lord showed us this way. Concerning the preaching of the gospel, we are fully clear that we need to go to visit people by knocking on their doors. There are many ways to preach the gospel, but visiting people by knocking on their doors is the top way for preaching the gospel.</p>
<p>Now that we have picked up the God-ordained way of preaching the gospel by visiting people in their homes, others are following us to do the same thing. In a conference of some Catholic bishops in 1987, one bishop said that if we have never knocked on people&rsquo;s doors, we have never consecrated ourselves to the preaching of the gospel. The Southern Baptist denomination recently decided to train eighty-nine thousand young laymen to go to visit people in their homes in Texas to get one million people saved within two months. They said that preaching the gospel by visiting people in their homes is according to the New Testament plan and will never be improved on. They discovered that this is the top way to preach the gospel. Out of this one million they intend to baptize seventy thousand to make them members of the Southern Baptist denomination. Their success in this endeavor will contribute to convincing all the believers that the top way to preach the gospel is to visit people where they are, to go to their homes.</p>
<p>To preach the gospel by visiting people in their homes does not exclude other ways to preach the gospel. Peter took advantage of the situation on the day of Pentecost to speak to thousands of people, and three thousand were added in one day. This was a special occasion arranged by the Lord, but it is not the God-ordained way to preach the gospel. The God-ordained way is to go to people where they are. Because they are in their homes, we must go there.</p>
<p>Actually, to knock on doors means to visit people. This is the scientific way to preach the gospel. It has been fully tested, and the results have been marvelous wherever it has been practiced in a proper way. Anything that is scientific remains. To preach the gospel to the people where they are is not only scientific but also logical and reasonable. Can we be satisfied merely by bringing a few people into Christ by inviting them to come to us? We invited many new ones to our love feasts in the past, but we did not bring in that many.</p>
<p>A spiritual giant may have big campaigns for the preaching of the gospel, but what is the real result for the building up of the church? Furthermore, when this spiritual giant is gone, who has been perfected to preach the gospel? Tradition has killed us, cheated us, and deceived us, so we must come back to the ordained way of perfecting all the saints. Ephesians 4:11 and 12 say, &ldquo;He gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints.&rdquo; The evangelists are not only for preaching the gospel but also for the perfecting of the saints to do the work of preaching the gospel as they do. We need to be perfected by some evangelists. We do not know how to preach the gospel in a proper and adequate way. Anyone can move his fingers on the keys of a piano, but to learn how to play the piano, a person must be perfected. The Lord&rsquo;s way is for all of us to be perfected. We need to be perfected by the evangelists who are the experts in preaching the gospel.</p><h2 class="head2">Home Meetings</h2>
<p>Although we have seen the light concerning how to preach the gospel in the most effective way, we still are not too clear regarding how to have the home meetings. For this one thing I reconsidered the entire New Testament chapter by chapter. The first mention of something related to the home meetings is in Matthew 18:20: &ldquo;For where two or three are gathered together into My name, there I am in their midst.&rdquo; Later we are told in Acts that the early believers met from house to house (2:46; 5:42). The phrase &ldquo;from house to house&rdquo; means &ldquo;according to houses.&rdquo; This means that every believer&rsquo;s house had a meeting. The number of meetings equalled the number of the believers&rsquo; houses. The Epistles show us that the early churches often met in a certain saint&rsquo;s home, such as the church in the house of Aquila and Priscilla (Rom. 16:5), the church in the house of Nymphas (Col. 4:15-16), and the church in the house of Philemon (Philem. 2).</p>
<p>Although we know these things concerning the home meetings, we still cannot find much in the New Testament regarding how to have the home meetings. After we learned the proper way of preaching the gospel according to God&rsquo;s ordained way as revealed in the Bible, we began to ask how we should take care of the home meetings. At first, the trainees in Taipei used <em>Truth Lessons</em> for their home meetings. Later, we published <em>Life Lessons</em> specifically to take care of the home meetings with the newly baptized ones.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Small Group Meetings</h2>
<p>The New Testament does not say much about how to have the small group meetings. Matthew 18:20 refers to two or three being gathered together. This may be considered also as a small group. Acts 12 says that while Peter was imprisoned, the saints came together to pray in Mary&rsquo;s home (v. 12). This may also be considered as a group meeting. In Hebrews 10:25 Paul says, &ldquo;Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together...but exhorting one another.&rdquo; This verse may indicate a group meeting. The above three verses, however, do not tell us what to do in a group meeting. This is all that the New Testament says concerning this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Church Meetings</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 14 and Ephesians 4 tell us much more regarding how to have the church meetings. We are more clear concerning the care of the church meetings because we have 1 Corinthians 14&mdash;a whole chapter of forty verses instructing us how to meet as a church. Verse 23 refers to the whole church coming together in one place. First Corinthians 14 and Ephesians 4 are particular chapters in the New Testament regarding the building up of the Body of Christ. The more that I speak on these two chapters, the more the light comes. Ephesians 4 has to be connected to 1 Corinthians 14 because without the perfecting of the saints, there is no possibility of having the saints prophesy one by one in the meeting, that is, to have the meeting that is mentioned in 1 Corinthians 14:26. Brother Nee saw this matter over fifty years ago in 1937, but he told us he could not find a way to practice it. He emphasized it again in 1948, but within a short time the communists took over mainland China. Brother Nee was put into prison, I was sent out, and we were frustrated again from practicing the revelation that he had seen of 1 Corinthians 14:26.</p>
<p>After four years of study beginning in 1984 in Taipei, the Lord has given us a clear view of 1 Corinthians 14 and Ephesians 4. In June of 1988, these two chapters came to the surface. First Corinthians 14 is a chapter centered on prophesying. The writer encourages the receivers of his Epistle to pursue, to desire, to seek, to excel, and to learn to prophesy. Prophesying does not come in an easy way. A student cannot get a degree without proper and diligent study. We need to pursue, desire, seek, and learn so that we may excel in prophesying for the building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>In October of 1988, I began to tell the saints in Taipei how to prophesy. I was like a coach teaching them the best way, the top way, the excelling way, to play ball. Within three weeks I saw the success in their church meetings. In the past many saints did not know what to do in the church meetings. The leading ones would charge them and urge them to speak, but they did not know how to speak or what to speak. I encouraged all the elders, the co-workers, and the full-timers to take the lead to practice to prophesy by composing a prophecy at the end of every week. They have taken the lead to practice this, and many of the saints have been brought into it.</p>
<p>Every morning during the week, we should enjoy the Lord in certain verses. We can take down some notes concerning what we enjoy of the Lord each morning. Then we will have notes from six mornings of enjoyment. On Saturday night we can look over our notes of what we have enjoyed during the week. From these notes we can have a topic to compose a short prophecy which is good for us to speak for three minutes. By practicing to speak what we have composed, we can determine whether it is too long or too short, whether we have to delete something or add something. Some in Taipei even pass on their composition of prophecy to someone who acts as a coach to give them more instructions to correct and adjust it. The saints are happy because now they know what to do and how to speak in the church meetings.</p>
<p>We have all the tools that we need to prophesy in the church meetings. We have the Recovery Version which is a properly translated New Testament with notes that open up the text and many helpful cross-references. We also have the Life-study Messages to help us. We are like carpenters who have the best tools to do the best carpentry to be &ldquo;an unashamed workman, cutting straight the word of the truth&rdquo; (2 Tim. 2:15). We also have a living spirit to pray and to exercise to get something from the Word. In this sense, it is easy to prophesy because we have the best tools and our spirit. Now we need to learn and practice.</p>
<p>If we take the way of composing something to prophesy, we will have something to present to the saints in the church meetings every Lord&rsquo;s Day. We will not need to wonder or worry about what to say because we can speak what we have prepared. We will be like the Israelites in the ancient time who labored on their land and eventually reaped something to bring to the feasts appointed by the Lord. They were not allowed to appear before the Lord empty-handed (Deut. 16:16). They had something in their hand to offer to the Lord for His satisfaction. The reality of this is in 1 Corinthians 14:26 where Paul says, &ldquo;Whenever you come together, each one has....&rdquo; Today in Taipei this verse has been applied. Over five thousand saints come together every Lord&rsquo;s Day morning in many district meetings of the church in the principle of 1 Corinthians 14:26&mdash;each one has something. They also take care of the sequence of their speaking. Someone who realizes he should not speak first will wait for the appropriate time to speak his prepared prophecy. When twenty persons prophesy in this way, it is like one person speaking a composed message. The contents are rich and arranged in a very good sequence.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>In order to have what is described by the Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 14, we must have the perfecting of the saints by the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherd-teachers in Ephesians 4. Some have said that after the apostles establish the churches with the elders, they should keep their hands off, having nothing to do with the churches and elders anymore. If the apostles did this, however, how could they perfect the saints?</p>
<p>Acts 20 tells us that on Paul&rsquo;s way to Jerusalem, he could not forget his burden for the church in Ephesus. From Miletus he sent for the elders of Ephesus to come to him. Paul told them that he was with them for three years (v. 31), teaching them publicly and from house to house (v. 20). For Paul to teach the saints publicly means there was some public exhortation, probably in front of the saints as a congregation. He also taught them according to their homes, admonishing them night and day with tears (v. 31). Paul did not keep his hands off the church in Ephesus. Rather, he remained with them for three years. When Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem in Acts 20, that was the latter part of his ministry, and the church in Ephesus was an established church. Even with such an established church, the apostle still bore the responsibility to perfect them. He asked the elders to remember how he was perfecting the saints night and day for three years. An apostle should not only speak publicly but also go to the saints&rsquo; homes day and night to perfect them, to teach them mouth to mouth.</p>
<p>If the gifted persons&mdash;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherd-teachers&mdash;do their perfecting work, spontaneously all the perfected saints will do the same work that they do. The saints will participate in the work of the ministry, which is to build up the Body of Christ. Ephesians 4 tells us that the church as the Body of Christ is not built up by the gifted persons directly. Their work is to perfect the saints. Then the perfected saints do the direct building of the Body of Christ (vv. 11-12).</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:16 says that the Body builds itself up in love. Where is the reality of such a verse on the earth today, and where can we see a meeting according to 1 Corinthians 14:26? In the early church, there was such a reality for a short time, but it disappeared through the degradation of the church. The Lord needs to recover the reality of 1 Corinthians 14:26 on the earth. We have to believe that now is the time for the Lord to recover this matter. Fifty years ago our senior co-worker, Brother Nee, saw and presented this to us. He is not here today, but this truth remains with us in his books. We are following his steps to recover 1 Corinthians 14:26 for the building up of the Body of Christ. If we are not the persons to recover this verse, who are? If today is not the time, when is the time? Should we go back to the old way to remain in our comfortable situation and forget about this verse, giving up what Brother Nee spoke and published?</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONDEMNING OUR HABIT TO TAKE THE NEW WAY<br />
FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>I realize that it is not easy for the elders of the church to suddenly change to a new way. It is much easier to remain in the old way because something has been set up, and every week they can do a routine work. They do not need to learn anything. They can routinely make the announcements about the scheduled times of the meetings, and appoint certain brothers to speak in the meetings. The only one that really bears the burden for the meeting is the one who has been assigned to speak. The others become passive.</p>
<p>I believe that we all love the Lord, the saints, and the church. Since this is the case, we must pay the price. Regardless of our age, we should pick up the burden to learn. Those who are close to me have reminded me of my age and have urged me not to labor so much, but I told them that I will not stop laboring until I die. Many of us are still young, and we have many years to learn new things for the Lord&rsquo;s new way. To go on with the Lord, we all have to condemn our habit. Habit is the biggest enemy. A number of years ago, some advised me that we needed computers for our editing work. Now our polishers use computers to do their work, but I do not use one because it is not my habit. I use this example as an illustration of how our habit can hinder us from progressing. I believe that some of the opposition to and criticism of the new way has been due to certain ones&rsquo; old habit. It may not be out of their heart to criticize or out of their intention to oppose, but their old habit is the problem. They do not want to have a change.</p>
<p>Some of the elders may want everything in the church under their control. If all the saints have the liberty to go out to knock on doors and baptize people, they may feel that the church will be confused and out of control. They may restrict all the activities of the saints so that everything is in good order under their control. I must say a frank word to my fellow co-workers who act in this way. Let all the saints be freed. Let them go out to baptize people. Give them the freedom to make mistakes. We all know that one of the best ways to learn is to make mistakes. If we are never mistaken, we will never learn anything.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the old way is not according to the holy Word. The new way is the scriptural way of meeting and serving to build up the Body of Christ. Let us put the old way aside and pick up the new &ldquo;machine.&rdquo; If a person does not know how to use a computer, he may criticize the use of it. In the same way, I heard the criticism of the new way by those who did not want to give up the old way which was according to their old habit. For Christian brothers to criticize other brothers who go out with the gospel to visit people in their homes is not in a right spirit, with a right attitude, or with a right heart. We need to humble ourselves to learn something that excels. No one can deny that there are many ways to preach the gospel, but the top way is to visit people where they are by knocking on their doors. We should go to their homes and speak to them concerning God, Christ, the Bible, the gospel, salvation, grace, and redemption. This is more than acceptable to our God. Some saints have gone out to visit people when it was raining heavily. This touched the hearts of the people they visited. They were touched that some would suffer to go out in such heavy rain to come to their home to preach the gospel. Nothing can restrict, frustrate, or stop the preaching of the gospel by visiting people in their homes. We can go to every street and every home of the city where we live to find the sons of peace (Luke 10:5-6). Why would we not pick up this way? I have the assurance that if thirty percent of the saints would pick up this burden, every church could be doubled yearly.</p>
<p>My burden is to present to you what I have received in my four year study beginning in 1984 in Taipei. We must practice four things. First, we need to visit people in their homes for the preaching of the gospel. Second, we need to have home meetings to nourish the new believers. Third, we need to have small group meetings to take care of the saints and to teach them the truth for their edification. Fourth, we need to have church meetings to exhibit Christ and minister Christ to the saints for the building up of the Body of Christ by the developing and exercising of the saints&rsquo; organic functions. For this we need to perfect every saint to prophesy. According to the principle of the Bible, it is better that every week we have one day for the church to come together. In this meeting the saints must learn to prophesy. If one third of the saints in a meeting of fifty to one hundred saints would prophesy, the time would be filled up with the riches of Christ. Then the saints will be built up as members of the organic Body of Christ, and the church as the organism of the Triune God will be organically built up.</p>
<p>If we practice the four points mentioned above, 1 Corinthians 14 and Ephesians 4 will be fully recovered and the building up of the organic Body of Christ will be taking place on this earth as a strong testimony of the resurrected Christ. Then the bride will make herself ready for Christ, the Bridegroom, to return. Let us endeavor to pick up these four points, these four &ldquo;machines,&rdquo; to reach the goal.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE PRACTICE<br />
OF PERFECTING THE SAINTS<br />
FOR THE ORGANIC BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:11-16; Acts 20:17-20, 31</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, thank You for Your mercy, for Your love, and for Your grace. We thank You for Your rich provision. Lord, You have given us Your blood, Your Spirit, and Your Word. Lord, we trust in all of Your provisions. Have mercy on us again. We treasure Your love, and we thank You for Your grace. Lord, we want to exercise our spirit to touch You. Grant us Your rich anointing in the speaking of Your word. Lord, under the precious blood, we thank You that You are the victorious One and that we are overcoming the world, sin, and our self in You, with You, and by You. Lord, be our help at this hour. Grant us to be one spirit with You in the speaking of Your word. Lord, vindicate Your way, and speak to us. Make our speaking divine speaking. Lord, we thank You and worship You again. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT<br />
FOR OUR ENJOYMENT</h2>
<p>We saw in chapter one that 1 Corinthians is on Christ as our portion for our enjoyment. In the past I pointed out there are at least nineteen items of Christ as our portion in 1 Corinthians (see note 9<sup>2</sup> in 1 Corinthians 1&mdash;Recovery Version). Paul first says that Christ is our portion. He is &ldquo;theirs and ours&rdquo; (1:2). The concluding aspect of Christ in 1 Corinthians is that He, as the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit (15:45). If we are going to enjoy Christ as our portion, we have to realize that this portion today is the Spirit. All the items of Christ in 1 Corinthians, such as Him being our wisdom, righteousness, sanctification redemption (1:24, 30), are included in the life-giving Spirit. Without being the life-giving Spirit, how could Christ be our wisdom? Without being the life-giving Spirit, how could the objective Christ who is sitting on the throne in the heavens, be our spiritual food and spiritual drink (1 Cor. 10:3-4)? It would be impossible. He had to go through a process to become the life-giving Spirit so that we could eat and drink Him.</p>
<p>If someone put a big cow in front of me, I would have no way to eat it. The cow would have to go through a process to become steaks to make it eatable. The &ldquo;raw&rdquo; God could not be our portion. Because God has been processed, &ldquo;cooked,&rdquo; we can enjoy Him as our portion. The Word who is God became the last Adam in His incarnation. God became a man. Through death and resurrection this Man became the Spirit. John 1:14 and 1 Corinthians 15:45b tell us of these two &ldquo;becames.&rdquo; The Word became flesh, and the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. Our God went through these two major processes. Thus, the &ldquo;raw&rdquo; God became the &ldquo;cooked&rdquo; God, and the &ldquo;cooked&rdquo; God today is the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>This truth is not according to today&rsquo;s traditional theology which says that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not only distinct but also separate. The Bible, however, tells us that God is one. He is one God, yet He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. He is three-one. W. Griffith Thomas, the founder of Dallas Theological Seminary, said that we may borrow the word <em>persons</em> to describe the three of the Godhead, but if we press this too far it will lead to the heresy of tritheism, the teaching of three Gods. According to the truth of the Scriptures the three of the Godhead are distinct but they are not separate. Our portion, who is God embodied in Christ (Col. 2:9), went to the cross as the last Adam in the flesh to die. He then resurrected, and in resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GROWTH IN LIFE ISSUING<br />
IN THE PRECIOUS MATERIALS FOR GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING AND IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GIFTS</h2>
<p>If we enjoy such a Christ, we will surely grow in life. In the previous chapter we saw that the growth in life issues in the development of the gifts. We also have to realize that according to 1 Corinthians 3, the growth in life first issues in the precious materials for the building up of the church (vv. 6-7, 12). For us to be transformed into gold, silver, and precious stones is not for individual spirituality. As the materials, we must be precious because we are for God&rsquo;s building. The growth in life first issues in the precious materials for God&rsquo;s building and then in the development of the gifts. To build any kind of building, first you need the materials. Then you need the skills to build it. The materials and the skills are the issues of the growth in life by our enjoyment of the all-inclusive, processed Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God, as the life-giving Spirit. The ultimate consummation of the enjoyment of Christ for the growth in life is the church built with the materials and by the skills.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXCELLING GIFT OF PROPHESYING</h2>
<p>In chapter thirteen Paul tells us that love is above prophesying. Verse 8 says that love will remain forever, but prophecies shall be done away with. In the first verse of chapter fourteen, Paul says, &ldquo;Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.&rdquo; In chapter thirteen Paul made love higher than all the gifts, but in chapter fourteen he made prophesying more desirable. We may say that Paul was promoting prophesying in chapter fourteen. In Philippians 3 Paul promoted one thing&mdash;Christ. Christ was promoted to the top by Paul in that chapter. He annulled and belittled everything else to the extent that everything other than Christ was dung (v. 8). In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul also promoted prophesying to the uttermost.</p>
<p>In verse 12 he says, &ldquo;Since you are zealous of spirits, seek that you may excel to the building up of the church.&rdquo; The adjective &ldquo;zealous&rdquo; is actually the noun &ldquo;zealots&rdquo; in the Greek. What does Paul mean when he says the Corinthians were zealots of spirits? Galatians 3:14 says that the promised Spirit is the very blessing of God&rsquo;s salvation. The top blessing in God&rsquo;s salvation given to us by God is God Himself as the Spirit. Before they were saved, the Corinthians were zealous for demonic spirits, but now that they are saved, they should be zealous for the Holy Spirit. Now that they are believers, they need to seek the excelling Holy Spirit for the excelling gift of prophecy. The word &ldquo;excel&rdquo; may also be translated into &ldquo;abound.&rdquo; Because the context of this verse is one of comparison, that is, one of comparing prophecy with speaking in tongues, &ldquo;excel&rdquo; is the right translation here. In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul is not talking of abundance or scarcity but of being low or excelling. To speak in tongues is too low, whereas to prophesy is to excel. We should seek to excel for the purpose of building up the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>Paul promoted prophesying so highly because this is the top gift that builds up the Body of Christ. On the one hand, Christ was promoted by Paul to the uttermost in Philippians 3. Everything other than Him is dung. On the other hand, in building up the Body of Christ, nothing is higher than prophesying. In 1 Corinthians 14:4 Paul says, &ldquo;He who prophesies builds up the church.&rdquo; First Corinthians 14 is a chapter on prophesying for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ. This is the goal of the entire book of 1 Corinthians. First Corinthians is on the enjoyment of Christ for the growth in life, and this growth accomplishes two things. First, it produces the precious materials for the building up of the Body of Christ. Second, it issues in the gifts, which are the skills, the techniques, to build up the church of Christ with the precious materials produced by the growth in life. Eventually, this book begins with the enjoyment of Christ and consummates with the built up church.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul promoted prophesying, but he did not tell us how to prophesy. In verse 31, though, he says, &ldquo;You can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn....&rdquo; If we speak something and others learn something, that means that we ourselves had to learn first. To speak in tongues is purely miraculous and does not require any learning, but to prophesy is a miraculous normality. Because the one who hears the prophecy learns, the prophesier has to learn first. Paul charges and urges us to prophesy in 1 Corinthians 14. In a sense, he even requires us to prophesy. As long as we are Christians, members of Christ, we must prophesy. Paul was burdened to perfect the saints to prophesy.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICE OF PERFECTING THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>In the book of Ephesians, Paul tells us that the gifts&mdash;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers&mdash;are for the perfecting of the saints (4:11-12). Then Acts 20 shows us how the writer of Ephesians, the Apostle Paul, perfected the saints in Ephesus. The book of Ephesians presents the teaching given to the saints in Ephesus, while Acts 20 presents the practice of the writer. The teaching in Ephesians 4 and the practice in Acts 20 are by the same apostle. Paul taught the perfecting of the saints and he practiced it.</p>
<p>The record of Paul&rsquo;s practice in Acts 20 opens a window for us to see how to perfect the saints. In Acts 20 Paul said that he did not shrink from declaring to the saints in Ephesus all the counsel of God (v. 27). According to his word in Acts 20, Paul surely taught prophesying to them. If Paul had not taught the Ephesians to prophesy, how could he have said that he declared all the counsel of God to them? According to 1 Corinthians 14, prophecy is a great thing. Prophecy is the excelling gift, the gift above all gifts. Surely Paul taught the Ephesians concerning the excelling gift of prophecy as a part of the entire counsel of God. Furthermore, Paul wrote his first Epistle to the Corinthians from Ephesus (1 Cor. 16:8). While Paul was in Ephesus writing to the Corinthians concerning the excelling gift of prophecy, he was surely teaching the Ephesians the same thing.</p>
<p>In Acts 20 he told the elders of the church in Ephesus, &ldquo;You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you all the time&rdquo; (v. 18). Paul was with the saints in Ephesus for three years. He not only taught them publicly in meetings but also taught them from house to house (v. 20). Night and day, he did not cease admonishing each one of the saints with tears (v. 31). This teaches us how to perfect the saints. When Paul was teaching the saints publicly and from house to house in Ephesus, he surely instructed them how to prophesy.</p>
<p>If you ask me how to perfect the saints, I will tell you to read Acts 20. The way is there. First, we need to be with the saints. If I have the burden to perfect the saints in a certain locality, I need to go there, following Paul&rsquo;s pattern to stay there for three years. Paul even went to Ephesus and stayed there without being asked or invited by the brothers. He volunteered to stay with the Ephesians for three years. Second, we have to teach the saints everything we know concerning the counsel of God. We need to be like Paul, who did not shrink from declaring to the saints all the counsel of God (v. 27). While we are staying with the saints, we have to open up all the things concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, His eternal plan. We would share how, according to His economy, He became a man, acquiring humanity in addition to His divinity, and how He died on the cross in a sevenfold way to solve all the problems in the universe. We would also teach many other things concerning His economy.</p>
<p>In addition to teaching the saints, Paul also admonished them. As an illustration of what it means to admonish, let us consider a father speaking to his son about his need to study diligently. The father might say: &ldquo;I have taught you to study hard, but you are still so sloppy in doing your schoolwork. As your father, I admonish you with tears to study hard. If you do not get a degree, you will have no future. If you want to live a better life, you must study, son.&rdquo; This is not to teach but to admonish. Paul was so concerned for the saints in Ephesus that his admonishing was with tears. In verse 19 Paul said that he served the Lord with tears, and in verse 31 he said that he admonished each saint with tears.</p>
<p>As we have pointed out, Paul should have definitely taught prophesying to the saints in Ephesus since he did not shrink from declaring to them all the counsel of God. I also believe that Paul taught the Corinthians about prophesying before he wrote 1 Corinthians. We know that Paul had contact with them before he wrote 1 Corinthians because he referred to a previous letter that he wrote them (1 Cor. 5:9). Before writing 1 Corinthians to them, he must have definitely taught them to prophesy, to speak for Christ, to speak forth Christ, to speak Christ into others in their meeting. If he had never taught them this matter in the past, he could not have referred them to it. In 14:1 he can say, &ldquo;Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.&rdquo; If he had not taught them prior to that time, the Corinthians would not have even known the term <em>prophesy.</em> How could Paul have charged them to prophesy if he had not taught them something about it and if they had no knowledge of it? First Corinthians 14 indicates that prophesying was taught beforehand to the Corinthians by the Apostle Paul. Therefore, in writing this Epistle, he can refer them to prophesying. Paul was perfecting them to prophesy. Based upon Ephesians 4 and Acts 20, it is clear that the saints need to be perfected to prophesy.</p>
<p>The gifted members were given to the Body for the perfecting of the saints. Acts 5:42 says, &ldquo;And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and bringing the good news of Jesus as the Christ.&rdquo; We need to ask who &ldquo;they&rdquo; are. In Acts 2 the three thousand new disciples met from house to house, but in 5:42 &ldquo;they&rdquo; refers to the apostles mentioned in verses 40 and 41. The apostles did not cease in two things: teaching and gospel preaching. They did this in two places: in the temple and from house to house. I believe that they were preaching in the temple and teaching in the houses. The first group of apostles taught from house to house to perfect the three thousand new ones who were saved on the day of Pentecost and those who were saved afterwards. On the one hand, the apostles preached the gospel to the public in the temple, and on the other hand, when people were saved, they went to their homes to teach them. To teach is to perfect. This is the great lack among us.</p>
<p>In the past, we may have baptized some new ones, but not many of them remained because we left them as orphans. Who went to their homes again and again to teach them? To bring people into the Lord&rsquo;s salvation and then to leave them without perfecting them is a traditional poison that we have inherited from Christianity. In Christianity there are big gospel campaigns in which thousands may be saved, but eventually these saved ones become orphans with no one to care for them. Very few pastors or preachers in Christianity still go out to visit people in their homes. In the old way, we preached the gospel in our meeting halls and invited the new ones to come to us. If some did believe and get baptized, very few picked up the burden to take care of them. This old way has to be condemned and abandoned. If we do not abandon the old way, we will not receive the divine blessing. We need to pick up the burden to go out to visit people with the gospel by knocking on their doors. When some believe and are baptized, we need to go back to their homes again and again to teach them. Some have asked, &ldquo;We baptize many, but where are they today?&rdquo; When I hear this, I would ask, &ldquo;Where are the ones to go back to their homes to teach them day after day?&rdquo; If a mother delivers a child and does not give any care to the child afterwards, the child will die.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO VISIT PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES<br />
WITH THE GOSPEL<br />
FOR THE INCREASE OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The first step we need is the step of begetting. To visit people in their homes with the gospel by knocking on their doors is for begetting. We need to do this. We have to admit that we have been very low in our rate of increase. We need to drop all our vain talk and go out once a week to knock on people&rsquo;s doors. Maybe the first week that we go out, we will not gain anyone, but the second week we may get two baptisms. We should not go out to knock on more doors because we have to take care of these two new ones. We have to nourish and cherish them. If one of them is not so positive or open, we can go out again to gain some more new ones. If we do not have the assurance that one out of three that we baptize will remain, we had better baptize four, looking to the Lord that we will gain one of these for the church life. If we take this way, we can surely bring at least one into the church life yearly.</p>
<p>If some of us do not have the strength or the heart to go out, we should joyfully support those who do. Since we all love the Lord Jesus, love to preach the gospel, and love to see sinners get saved, we should pray for the saints who go out to visit people in their homes even though we cannot go. We should thank the Lord for so many who are willing to go out, praying for them and looking to the Lord for His blessing upon the church. As long as such an activity is for the gospel of the Lord, we should thank the Lord that He has burdened so many. It is not an easy thing to knock on people&rsquo;s doors. The ones who go out may get doors slammed in their faces and they may get rebuked, but they are happy to suffer such a shame for the Name of the dear One whom they love.</p>
<p>When I went back to Taiwan in 1984, I realized that the first thing we had to do to revolutionize our practice was to take care of the proper preaching of the gospel. We must get the increase for the building up of the Body of Christ. This is why I paid such a great price to return to Taipei to test out this matter of visiting people by knocking on their doors. The Lord&rsquo;s blessing on this scriptural, God-ordained way has been proven by the marvelous results.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING THE SCRIPTURAL WAY<br />
FOR THE ORGANIC BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>After my four-year study in Taipei, I have picked up these four crucial points: 1) begetting by gospel preaching; 2) nourishing by home meetings; 3) teaching by small group meetings; and 4) building up the church by church meetings. These four points are the scriptural way we must take for the building up of the Body of Christ. Now is the time for the Lord to recover 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Ephesians 4:11-16. I have the full assurance that the Lord will move today to recover these two portions of the Word. We must admit that the age for these items is here. The tide has come. Sooner or later we will have to go along with this tide. It is not an accident that the Southern Baptists and other denominations and groups realize that they need to have a change in the way that they preach the gospel and serve the Lord. We must abandon the old, traditional way and pick up the new, scriptural way.</p>
<p>We must be advised, however, not to take the new way in a fast way. We have to take it gradually as I did with the brothers in Taiwan. We spent thirty-seven months to study and to prepare before we completely stopped the old way. We should not take the new way too fast or cause too much loss. We must be careful to go on positively in a gradual way, and we must have a clear view with a definite purpose. We need a clear view that the Lord is finished with the old way. We must have a vision that these two crucial portions of the Word&mdash;1 Corinthians 14:26 and Ephesians 4:11-16&mdash;need to be fully recovered. The Lord desires to build up the organic Body of Christ, not a congregational church. These portions of the Word must be recovered so that the Body of Christ as the organism of the Triune God can be built up and prepared to be His bride for His coming again. Our senior co-worker, Brother Nee, stressed this matter twice beginning over fifty years ago, and we must pick up this burden. We have to believe that this is the time and that we are the right people for the Lord to use to recover these two portions of the Word.</p>
<p>If you do not want to take this way, I am concerned that you will become a dropout. If we see the vision of the new way and practice it gradually to bring the saints under our care into the understanding of such a change, we will not suffer that much loss. Of course, to change anything in practice will always result in some loss, but the profit that will result over the long run makes the change more than worthwhile.</p>
<p>In order for Paul&rsquo;s teaching in Ephesians 4 concerning the perfecting of the saints to be carried out, we need to follow his practice in Acts 20 and the practice of the apostles in Acts 5:42. Then the saints will be perfected. According to Ephesians 4:16, the saints in the Body of Christ are categorized into two groups: &ldquo;every joint of the rich supply&rdquo; and &ldquo;each one part.&rdquo; The joints are the gifted persons&mdash;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherd-teachers. The Body grows by being joined closely together through the joints and by being knit together through the operation in measure of each one part. Through the gifted persons&rsquo; supply and through all the members&rsquo; operation in their measure, all the Body causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love. The Body of Christ is built up organically by causing itself to grow through the functions of the gifted persons and through the members who operate in their measure.</p>
<p>For this organic building to be realized, the gifted persons must do their best to perfect every saint. The co-workers and the elders who are taking care of the saints need to go to their homes. If we have a revelation as a new vision, we can call a meeting of the local churches. We can even have a conference with the nearby churches to give a series of messages to cover a particular vision, a particular revelation, which we have received of God. Ordinarily and regularly, however, we do not need to do this. Ordinarily, we need the elders and co-workers to go to visit the saints&rsquo; homes to teach them personally and directly, mouth to mouth, year round. There is not such a practice among us so far. Thus far, many of the leading ones in the churches do a routine work.</p>
<p>It is not enough for the elders merely to decide the meeting schedule of the church and come to the meetings in a routine way without any endeavoring. First of all, we ourselves have to dive into the Word to learn how to perfect ourselves. As we are being perfected ourselves, we can go to visit the saints house after house, day and night, to nourish them, cherish them, and teach them one by one sometimes with tears. This will consummate in the perfecting of all the saints. They will all be enabled to speak. Each one part will operate in its own measure. Then all the saints will function, and there will be no clergy or laity among us. All the saints meeting with us will be perfected, equipped, and furnished to speak forth Christ. This will issue in the accomplishment of the Lord&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire, the organic building up of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The Lord has expected this organic building for almost two thousand years, but what is being practiced in today&rsquo;s Christianity is the traditional clergy-laity system. The mass of the believers are so-called laymen. Here are two ways for us to choose from&mdash;the old way of the clergy and the laity or the new way of the organic building up of the Body of Christ through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in measure of each one part. We all must take the new, scriptural way. For this new way we all have to labor diligently, especially the leading ones and the co-workers. It is not acceptable to prepare a message to speak once a week, and then take it easy the rest of the week to have leisure time.</p>
<p>Some have said that we should forget about the work and come back to the enjoyment of Christ, but we need to realize that the enjoyment of Christ always has an issue. If a branch of the vine tree is really and richly enjoying the life juice from the tree, surely the branch will bear fruit (John 15:5). If the branch has not borne fruit for years, it has probably already been cut off (15:2a, 6). A person may think that he is enjoying Christ, but actually he may be cut off from the enjoyment of Christ. He may be self-deceived. Have we been enjoying Christ year after year? Where is our fruit? When I returned to Taipei in 1984, they only had three thousand in attendance at the Lord&rsquo;s table. Today they have five thousand at the table. They also have thousands of new ones that they are caring for in home meetings and small group meetings. The saints and churches who have practiced visiting people in their homes with the gospel have testified of the fruitfulness of this way. Can we give a testimony in a definite way of the fruit that we have borne?</p>
<p>If the way that I have presented to you is ordained by God and is according to the Scriptures, we have to practice it at any cost. Then the Lord will have a way with us to finish His recovery. Otherwise, we may force Him to drop us and go to others. The Lord dropped others in His move and came to us sixty years ago, but where are we today? The gifted ones&mdash;the leading ones and the co-workers&mdash;need to perfect the needy saints, not by speaking to them as a congregation but by visiting them in their homes. Some of the older co-workers may feel that they have become useless now that we are changing to the new way. Actually, if the older ones pick up the new way, they will become more useful. Their years of experience are needed for the perfecting of the saints. If we do not go along with the tide of the Spirit in this age, however, we will become dropouts. Time does not wait for us. This is why the New Testament tells us to redeem the time (Eph. 5:16). The older ones are more useful, but they have to go along with the present advance of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>

<h1 class="title">SEEING THE VISION OF<br />
THE LORD&rsquo;S PRESENT RECOVERY<br />
AND PRACTICING IT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 16:18; Eph. 4:11-16; 1 Cor. 14:26</h1>
<p>In this chapter I would like to fellowship concerning how we should go on according to our present situation. We need to see the vision of the Lord&rsquo;s present recovery and put this vision into our practice.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GIFTS IN THE BODY<br />
FOR THE PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>The Bible presents us with a clear picture of God&rsquo;s desire for the church as the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23a), the expression of Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God (Col. 2:9). The Lord Jesus told us that He would build His church upon the divine revelation of Himself as the Christ (Matt. 16:18). He does not, however, build up His church directly. In order to build His church, He first accomplished His full redemption from His incarnation through His ascension. In His ascension He poured Himself out upon God&rsquo;s chosen ones to make them His Body (Acts 2:2-4, 16-17a; 10:45; 1 Cor. 12:13), and He constituted some of His members as particular gifts for the building up of this Body (Eph. 4:8). In His ascension He gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers (4:11). These are the particular gifts which are considered as the joints of the supply in Ephesians 4:16. The article &ldquo;the&rdquo; in this verse is emphatic and indicates a particular and rich supply. According to the New Testament revelation, this particular, rich supply is the riches of Christ. The riches of Christ are the rich supply for His Body. These particular riches of the rich Christ are being distributed to His entire Body by the joints.</p>
<p>We must be clear about these four categories of particular members who are the joints of the Body of Christ: the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. The written record of the New Testament was completed by the end of the first century. In the first century the church did have these four categories of joints. Some have even called the first century the age of the apostles. Those who think this way have a mistaken concept. If we say that the first century was the age of the apostles, this implies strongly that after the first century, there are no more apostles. John Nelson Darby was one who taught that there were no more apostles after the first century. Actually, however, we have to see and admit that there have been these four categories of gifted persons throughout the history of the church.</p>
<p>There have been evangelists such as C. H. Spurgeon in England and D. L. Moody and Charles Finney in the United States. There have also been many shepherds. A pastor is another term for a shepherd. When the Brethren were raised up by the Lord in the early part of the nineteenth century, many great teachers were produced. They opened up the Bible to a greater extent than it had ever been opened before since the first century. According to church history, there have also been a number of apostles. William Carey went to India and brought the Lord&rsquo;s name, the gospel, and the Bible there. Surely he was an apostle. Hudson Taylor was sent by the Lord to China, and David Livingstone went to Africa. These brothers were also apostles.</p>
<p>It is hard to make a distinction between an apostle and a prophet. It is also hard to draw a line between the prophets and the teachers. The teachers are very close to the prophets because they both teach. According to 1 Timothy 3:2, the elders must be those who are apt to teach. Furthermore, according to 1 Timothy 5:17, some of the elders should be those who labor in word and teaching. Thus, the prophets, the teachers, and the elders all teach. It is not so easy to distinguish these persons. We have to admit, however, that throughout the past centuries of church history, the church has had the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers.</p>
<p>In the early days of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in China, Brother Watchman Nee was greatly influenced by Brethren teachings. He greatly admired John Nelson Darby. When I went to Shanghai to visit him in 1933, he gave me Darby&rsquo;s synopsis of the entire Bible. I received much help from those volumes. In 1933 Brother Nee was invited by the Brethren to visit them in Europe, England, and Canada. During that trip he saw the real situation among them. He realized that we could not follow the Brethren in an absolute way because of their serious mistake in the practice of the church life. At that time he began to study the Bible to see the proper practice of the church life. The light that he received during that time is in the book entitled <em>The Assembling Life</em> (not yet translated into English). Because he was influenced by Darby&rsquo;s teaching regarding the apostles, however, he said that we dare not say that we are the apostles today. Actually, some brothers among us at that time were like the apostles, so he was forced to say that we were the &ldquo;unofficial apostles,&rdquo; while brothers such as Paul, Peter, and John were official apostles. Darby also taught that there were no longer any elders in the church. The Brethren assemblies have &ldquo;responsible brothers,&rdquo; not elders. Eventually, I considered this matter, and I realized that many brothers are responsible brothers. Everyone who functions is a responsible person. Based on Darby&rsquo;s concept concerning apostles and elders, Brother Nee said in <em>The Assembling Life</em> that the unofficial apostles have the unofficial right to establish and appoint the unofficial elders. At Brother Nee&rsquo;s request, I wrote a long preface to this four chapter book that was published in 1934.</p>
<p>Within the next three years, Brother Nee saw more light. In 1937 he became bold to say, &ldquo;If we are not the apostles, who are?&rdquo; Since the gospel was preached in many pagan regions, churches were established, and elders were appointed, how could there not be apostles? From that time he began to say that we were the official apostles and that the elders established by us were official elders. This light concerning the apostles is in his book <em>The Normal Christian Church Life.</em></p>
<p>Throughout the history of the church in these past nineteen centuries, some of God&rsquo;s people were in the category of the gifted ones mentioned in Ephesians 4&mdash;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. Even today, although Christianity has become so degraded, these kinds of persons are on the earth. These categories of gifted persons are given by the Head and used by the Head to perfect the saints. The Head does not build the Body directly, but the Head gives the gifts. The gifts also do not build the Body directly. Instead, they perfect all the saints, and the saints do the direct building work.</p>
<p>Even the evangelists are for the perfecting of the saints. For many years my concept has been that the evangelists are only good for going out to preach the gospel, but Ephesians 4 tells us that Christ gave them to perfect the saints. After our four-year study which began in 1984 in Taipei, we see that in the proper procedure to build up the Body of Christ, the first step is to preach the gospel. For this we need the perfecting, the training. The Greek word for perfecting implies the thought of equipping and furnishing. When a person joins the army, they will teach him and equip him with a uniform, weapons, and ammunition. They will also furnish him with supplies. Perfecting is teaching, equipping, and furnishing. It is hard to find someone among us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery who has really been perfected in the preaching of the gospel. If we were at war and were suddenly gathered to form an army, would we know how to fight? We might shoot ourselves instead of shooting the enemy. We would need to be perfected to fight. When we go out to preach the gospel, this is the real fighting against the Devil and his demons.</p>
<p>A proper evangelist, in his perfecting of the saints, would know how to stir them up. After his speaking to the saints, their hearts would be burning for the gospel. Is there anyone in our locality burning for the preaching of the gospel? There may not be anyone. We may want to preach the gospel, but we may not have the burning spirit to do it. If a real evangelist were to stay with us for even a short period of time, we would be burning for the preaching of the gospel. This is part of his perfecting work.</p>
<p>There are many things that we have to do to perfect the saints in the preaching of the gospel. In the past whenever I trained the saints to preach the gospel, I first taught the truths of the gospel. I taught truths such as who Christ is, what redemption is, what justification is, and what it is to repent, believe, and be baptized. We prepared a manual with all of these gospel truths in them. Even in the coming days, when we perfect the saints in the preaching of the gospel, we may need to use that manual to see all the truths of the gospel. We need to see the difference between justification and reconciliation and the difference between forgiveness of sins and the washing away of sins. If we do not know these truths of the gospel, how can we preach the gospel adequately? I also taught the saints how to classify the different kinds of people to whom we are preaching the gospel.</p>
<p>Some of the saints who were trained in Taipei recently picked up new skills in their gospel preaching. When you knock on a person&rsquo;s door and they ask who it is, how you answer will many times determine whether or not they let you in. You may say, &ldquo;We are here to bring you good news!&rdquo; This answer may get you in the door, but then you may say the wrong thing to them, and they may ask you to leave. For the preaching of the gospel today, we need more perfecting. The burden of the gifted persons is to perfect the saints, and the perfected saints do the direct building work.</p>
<p>After being perfected, the saints, according to Ephesians 4:15, will grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things. Here is a problem. Are not the members of Christ in Christ already? Suppose a brother comes to you, an elder, and says: &ldquo;First Corinthians 1:30 says that God has put us into Christ. Why then does Ephesians 4:15 say that we have to grow up into Him? Aren&rsquo;t these two verses contradictory?&rdquo; If you give him a doctrinal answer concerning the twofoldness of the divine truth, you may lead him into the forest. The elders first need to be perfected so that they can perfect others. If you were perfected, you might answer the brother like this: &ldquo;It is true that we are in Christ, brother, but what about our living? Although you are in Christ, you may still go to the movie theater. Is going to the movie theater the living of one who is in Christ? You are in Christ, but you are not living in Christ in a practical way. Therefore, you need to grow in life so that you can grow up into Christ practically.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the saints do not get perfected, how can they grow and cause the Body to grow? In other words, how can they build the church? Ephesians 4:15 says that we need to grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things, and verse 16 says that out from the Head, all the Body causes the growth of the Body. The entire Body is joined closely together and knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in measure of each one part. For the entire Body to cause the growth of the Body, all of us need to be perfected. We have to admit that we are short of being perfected. We may have been generally edified in the past by listening to messages, but how much of the truth has been constituted into us? How many of us can tell what sanctification and holiness are and what the difference is between them? This shows us how much perfection we need. For the perfecting work to take place after the gospel has been preached, there is the need of home meetings, small group meetings, and church meetings.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT DOING A ROUTINE WORK,<br />
BUT ENDEAVORING AND LABORING</h2>
<p>All of us who are elders and co-workers must endeavor. We must learn from the Apostle Paul who labored day and night and who served the Lord with tears (Acts 20:31, 19). Paul indicated in his Epistles to both Timothy and Titus that they had to stay to teach and train the elders. In Brother Nee&rsquo;s book <em>Church Affairs,</em> he points out that after the elders are established, they need to be perfected by the apostles who established them (pp. 14-21). He points out that there is the need to show the elders how to do the work. Brother Nee saw this and practiced it. One day when I was with him, he told me, &ldquo;Witness, we have the blueprint in our hand.&rdquo; This meant that he had the plan for building up a local church. While I was with him in Shanghai, I saw something, I learned, and I received the perfecting. Then I went back to Chefoo and practiced what I saw. I stayed in Chefoo from 1940 through 1942, and at the end of 1942, a big revival broke forth. According to my observation of the situation of the churches in the United States, most of the elders are groping because they have not been perfected. Because I have been so busy in traveling to different churches and in the editing of many publications, I have not had the time to stay in one place to be with the saints for an extended period of time. I have had to put out many books to supply the churches with the spiritual food, the life supply.</p>
<p>What should we do in our present situation as elders and co-workers? By His mercy, we must see a clear view of how the Lord, in His New Testament economy, builds up the churches. He builds up the churches first by giving gifted persons to His Body. Then He uses these gifted persons to perfect all the saints, and the perfected saints do the direct building work. We elders and co-workers should be the gifted persons, yet we may not know how to perfect others. This is why we must endeavor to learn the truths and endeavor to fellowship with one another concerning how to perfect a new one. Immediately after someone gets baptized, we have to consider how we can keep him and perfect him. We may have baptized many new ones in the past, but very few of them remained because no one went back to them again and again to perfect them. To do this requires much labor.</p>
<p>Instead of laboring, we like to do a routine work. A company, a factory, or a corporation does not make money through its routine workers. I was told a story concerning the Honda corporation that illustrates this point. In one of their big office buildings, there were many Americans in a big office space doing routine work eight hours a day. That work helped the corporation, no doubt, but the real money was made due to the fact that a small number of Japanese in a back office stayed late into the night to labor. It is also true that in the best colleges, the professors must labor hard. There is a slogan in the universities that says, &ldquo;Publish or perish.&rdquo; We need to put this slogan on our wall to remind us that we have to endeavor to learn something.</p>
<p>In the past, our Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meetings were carried out in a routine way. Very few came to the meeting with a sincere heart, burdened for the meeting. Most did not bear the burden even to pray for the meeting because they knew the responsible brothers would. The situation in the eldership in some places in the past was not so encouraging either. Before a brother became an elder, he may have been sitting in the back in the meeting without much exercise. One day he was appointed to be an elder, and then he came to sit in the first row. During the meeting the need might have arisen for a hymn or for a word to be spoken. The elders all looked at one another, but no one could meet the need.</p>
<p>Most of the elders do not endeavor; instead, they do a routine work. If I were doing a routine work, I would not be able to travel so much in order to hold so many conferences, nor would I be able to publish so many books. My fellowship with you here concerns the destiny of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. It is a matter of life or death. Do we really love the Lord? Are we really for Him and for His recovery? If we are, we have to forget about the routine work, and endeavor and labor to do something extra. Even as an older brother, I am still studying. The point is this: if there is no labor, no work, there is no result, no profit. People who desire to make a big profit in business do not waste their time. Anyone who works only eight hours a day cannot be wealthy. He can only make a living as an employee. Who among us is laboring for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery?</p>
<p>If we had been laboring, we would have studied the new way to carry out the increase and spread of the church. We would have practiced visiting people by knocking on their doors to find out about it and to break through in our increase. Spontaneously we would have set up a pattern for the other saints to follow. In the flock, the sheep taking the lead may be considered as the head sheep. The elders are the head sheep. When they go in a positive direction, the rest of the saints will follow them. In some places the elders did not do this. Instead of getting into preaching the gospel by visiting people in their homes and practicing it to set up a living example, they restricted the saints from knocking on doors and poured cold water upon this practice. Some want to stop the saints from going out to knock on doors. They do not care for the fruit, the increase.</p><h2 class="head1">DROPPING OUR OLD CONCEPTS<br />
AND PICKING UP THE NEW VIEW<br />
OF THE LORD&rsquo;S PRESENT RECOVERY</h2>
<p>In order to go on, we all need to drop our old concepts and pick up the new view of the Lord&rsquo;s present recovery. For the building up of the Body of Christ, we need the material. In Haggai the Lord charged the Israelites, &ldquo;Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified&rdquo; (1:8). Today we need to go to knock on doors because we need the material for God&rsquo;s house. I am sharing this with the hope that we could be rescued from the wrong understanding and wrong position. We all have to admit that there are many ways to preach the gospel, but to visit people in their homes is the best way.</p>
<p>The Lord told us in Luke 14:23, &ldquo;Go out into the roads and hedges and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled.&rdquo; The higher class people are not in the hedges. Only those who are lazy and idle will be there. In 1 Corinthians 1, Paul says that God has not called many wise, powerful, or wellborn people. Instead, most of the people God has chosen are the weak of the world, the lowborn of the world, and the despised (vv. 26-28). In Luke 14 the Lord told us to compel these people to come in.</p>
<p>We may be fully biased in our understanding and yet still believe that we are enjoying Christ. If we have not been bearing fruit for years, we may be cut off from the vine without realizing it (John 15:2a, 6). We may be in a self-deceiving position. If we are really enjoying Christ, we will surely bear fruit. Where has our fruit been in the past years? For our local church to remain at the same number year after year is a shame. I must be honest to the One whom I serve and to the ones whom I serve. We are too biased. We must come back to the straight way.</p>
<p>First, we have to visit people to gain them for the Lord&rsquo;s Body. Second, we must keep going back to visit them to have home meetings. Regardless of how little we think we know, we still must contact them as much as we can and minister to them as much as we know. After a child is born, the mother must immediately begin to care for him. We must go back again and again to visit the new ones begotten through us to take care of them. According to Ephesians 5:29, the Lord knows how to cherish and nourish His Body. We have to follow the Lord to cherish and nourish the new ones. Third, we also have to have small group meetings to teach and perfect them. Fourth, we have to perfect them to speak for the Lord, to prophesy, in the church meetings. Regardless of a person&rsquo;s ability, as long as he will labor, there will be some result. We have received a view of the Lord&rsquo;s present recovery. Now we must put this view into our practice.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICING THE LORD&rsquo;S PRESENT RECOVERY ACCORDING TO OUR SITUATION<br />
IN A GRADUAL AND POSITIVE WAY</h2>
<p>You also must take good care of the present situation you are in. You may be in a local church that is not so high, so living, or so encouraging. Hardly anyone may like to visit people by knocking on their doors, and some may even oppose it. What should you do in such a situation? You may have been sick with the same disease, so you should be able to sympathize with all the sick ones. You should be patient with them. You need to visit these dear ones to pray with them, to have fellowship with them, to warm up their cold heart, and to stir up their down spirit. You may have to do this for an entire year to get a few to rise up to realize the burden you are bearing. I believe the proverb that says: &ldquo;Where there is a will, there is a way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We need to practice the Lord&rsquo;s present recovery, His new way, but we should not be too hasty or rough. We need to be patient with the saints and we should not categorize them. We should love everyone with the same love and avoid creating any kind of division. We need to be with the saints the way Paul was in Ephesus. He told the brothers there, &ldquo;You yourselves know...how I was with you all the time&rdquo; (Acts 20:18). He was with the saints day by day for three years. Many of us may have to work for a living, but we still should have the evenings and weekends to give to the Lord. We can use our leisure time for the Lord&rsquo;s interests.</p>
<p>The unbelievers spend much time for their pleasure, amusement, and recreation. Actually, the best amusement is the church life. A brother among us told the story of his grandfather who was a baker. He worked in a bakery from 4 a.m. to 4 p.m., but nearly every day the first thing he did when he came home from work was to go and visit people for the Lord. No matter how we labor, it is much better than being idle. How wonderful it is to be in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and now by His mercy we have a way to practice the church life by the preaching of the gospel, home meetings, small group meetings, and church meetings. This way is full of labor but also full of joy. If we take this way, we will enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s presence, and we, our family, and our church will be greatly blessed.</p>
<p>According to our present situation, I feel that the wisest thing is for us to go on in a positive way. We must bring the saints into the full realization of the new way gradually by the Lord&rsquo;s leading. We should not lead the church into this in a hasty way. I want to point out again that the new way is composed of the following steps: 1) preaching the gospel for begetting; 2) having home meetings for nourishing; 3) having group meetings for teaching; and 4) having church meetings for building.</p>
<p>We have to visit people in their homes to pass on the gospel to them. I hope that all the churches will try to enter into preaching the gospel by visiting people in their homes. Once they believe and are baptized, we have to go back to them. In the first month it is best if we can visit them ten times. We need to continue to visit them in order to nourish and cherish them. In the first two or three times with them, we should do our best to help them realize that our Savior, Jesus Christ, is today the life-giving Spirit in their spirit. They need to realize that they have a regenerated spirit which they can exercise by calling on the name of the Lord and praying. Whenever we exercise our spirit, He moves and works within us. We can also help them to speak, first by helping them to give a testimony of their salvation. From the very beginning, we can train them to speak for the Lord. Every time we go to visit them, we can check with them, &ldquo;Do you have something to say for the Lord or of the Lord?&rdquo; We should always do this. Then from the very beginning of their Christian life, they will learn to speak the Lord.</p>
<p>We do not have many verses in the Bible to tell us how to carry out the home meetings and small group meetings, but we know that we need to pray much, exercise our spirit, and release our spirit when we meet with the new ones in their homes. We need to pray, praise, sing, and read verses from the Scriptures in a living way. Then the new ones will follow us and learn from us. The children spontaneously speak the language of their parents. When we release our spirit, they will learn from us. When we speak, we can also instruct and encourage them to speak by exercising their spirit. We can encourage them to first tell how they were saved and then encourage them to speak concerning how they experienced the Lord. They may say: &ldquo;This morning I did not have any joy. Then I prayed to the Lord and called upon Him, and I became joyful.&rdquo; We can encourage them by saying: &ldquo;Amen! Hallelujah! This is a good testimony.&rdquo; After about three months, they can be brought into the habit of speaking.</p>
<p>We need to go on from the home meetings to bring them into contact with other saints in their neighborhood for a small group meeting. In the small group meetings, there is the need of further teaching. It is helpful to use either the <em>Life Lessons</em> or <em>Truth Lessons</em> because all the necessary verses and material are there. It is not necessary to try to finish a lesson in one session. We may cover one lesson in three meetings with them. We also need to perfect the new ones to prophesy in the larger church meetings. Recently, I heard a new one who had only been saved for one year stand up in a meeting to speak on the life-giving Spirit. He spoke a good message concerning all the different titles of the Spirit, the essential and economical aspects of the Spirit, and the functions of the Spirit. Such a new one is evidence that the new way really works.</p>
<p>If there are fifty saints in a local church, we need to look to the Lord that all of them will be occupied with some practical service to the Lord. Fifteen saints could go out to gain people by knocking on their doors. Another fifteen may take care of the home meetings. Perhaps the ones who go out to preach the gospel could transfer the care of their new ones to the ones who are burdened for home meetings. Another fifteen saints could pick up the burden to take care of the small group meetings. Within a short time, maybe just three or four months, all fifty saints could be occupied with some practical service to the Lord, taking care of new ones and young ones. If each saint could take care of one newly baptized one for one year, think how much this new one would grow! All the teaching materials, the lesson books, are ready for us to use. We can pass these things on to the new ones through the Spirit by much prayer. By taking this way, it will be easy for the church to double in a year. The new ones that we gain will be born, raised up, and taught in the scriptural way. They will be xerox copies of us, doing the same thing that we do in our service.</p>
<p>It is not worthwhile for us to remain in the old way any longer. We need to take the new way gradually and positively. After the small group meetings, we need church meetings, or district meetings, of about fifty saints. Occasionally, we can have conferences to meet the need of the churches through the ministry of the Word. This way of gospel preaching by visiting people, home meetings, group meetings, and church meetings is scientific. This is the God-ordained, scriptural way that we must take for the building up of the Body of Christ. We pointed out in chapter one that even the Southern Baptists have said that visiting people in their homes with the gospel is the New Testament plan and will never be improved on. If we do not visit people where they are, how can we expect to gain them? If we only beget them and do not visit them again and again to nourish them and cherish them, how can we expect to keep them? In the past we encouraged the saints to share in the meetings, but we did not properly teach them to do this. If we do not teach the new ones under our care properly, how can we expect them to speak? All over the world today, there is a common system of education with six years of elementary school, six years of junior high and high school, four years of college, two to three years of graduate school for a Master&rsquo;s degree, and another two or three years for a Ph.D. This is the scientific way of educating people that is practiced, in principle, worldwide. The new way to practice the Lord&rsquo;s present recovery is also scientific and cannot be improved upon.</p>
<p>As we practice the new way, we should not criticize other places that are not practicing the same way that we are. Every place will be practicing the new way to one degree or another depending on the situation in that locality. I also ask the leading ones in every place not to restrict any of the saints. This is my word of love. An elder should not have the attitude that the saints need to get permission from him to go out and knock on doors. The elders may have the heart to keep the church in a good order, but they should not restrict the saints in this way. All the saints need to be free to exercise in order to develop their function. The people in the world exercise themselves by going to worldly and even sinful amusements, but actually the best amusement for the human life is the church life. The church life is the best place for us to exercise ourselves unto godliness (1 Tim. 4:7). To come to the church meetings to sit and listen to others is not to exercise. To exercise is first to pray much and go to knock on people&rsquo;s doors to preach the gospel to them. This will help us to enjoy the Lord more. It will even give us a greater appetite for the Lord as our spiritual food. The more we exercise, the greater our appetite will be. We can continue to exercise in the home meetings, small group meetings, and church meetings. We have to instruct the new ones how to prophesy in the church meetings with the exercise of their spirit. We even need to instruct them to speak loud enough for others to hear them. We need to perfect them.</p>
<p>If we take this new way the Lord has shown us, we will double after one year and many of the saints will have been trained, perfected, and instructed to speak with content. I believe that the Lord will recover this way to the uttermost. The result of this way is not a great congregation of people coming together as a facade to make a good show. If we are faithful to the Lord, the time will come when the Lord will gain twenty thousand out of a city of one hundred fifty thousand. On the Lord&rsquo;s Day, they all may be serving the Lord in different ways. Some may go out to knock on doors, some may go out to take care of home meetings, and others may be taking care of small group meetings. Then many homes throughout the city on nearly every street and lane will be worshipping the Lord, singing hymns to Him, praising Him, and speaking Him. Occasionally, maybe once a month or once every two or three months, the whole church will come together. If we do not have a big hall, we can use an auditorium or a stadium. We do not need the eldership to control things without the proper moving in the Lord&rsquo;s way. This is not according to the Scriptures. On the day of Pentecost, three thousand were baptized (Acts 2:41). Within a short time, &ldquo;the number of the men came to about five thousand&rdquo; (4:4). How could so many be under the mere control of the elders, that is, without the positive activities according to the Lord&rsquo;s leading? The only way that things could be under the elders&rsquo; mere control is for the church to remain with a small number. Such lack of increase is a shame to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEEING THE VISION<br />
OF THE LORD&rsquo;S PRESENT RECOVERY<br />
AND PRACTICING IT</h2>
<p>The way in the past did not work. The Lord desires to discard everything of the old, traditional, and unscriptural way. He desires to do something for His recovery in a new way. We must pick up the view of the Lord&rsquo;s present recovery. Otherwise, we will make ourselves dropouts. We will remain contented in our oldness. Whether or not we will go on with the Lord in His present recovery is up to us. But we have to realize that when the age turns it will not wait for us. Once the age changes, we can be passed by and become dropouts as far as the Lord&rsquo;s move is concerned. We must see the vision of the Lord&rsquo;s present recovery and practice it. Week after week and month after month, we will experience and learn something. As we do this, I have the assurance that the Lord&rsquo;s joy will be with us. Even more, I believe this practice will bring us into His presence. I am so strong in my old age to work so much because I have the deep sensation and consciousness that I have the Lord&rsquo;s presence. While I am speaking, I have the assurance that I am in His presence. His presence gives me the boldness. We must realize that no one can shake the Lord&rsquo;s recovery because it has been built upon life and truth. Although the storms come, the foundation of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery can never be shaken. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is something built solidly on Christ as the rock, and it is still going on.</p></body></html>
