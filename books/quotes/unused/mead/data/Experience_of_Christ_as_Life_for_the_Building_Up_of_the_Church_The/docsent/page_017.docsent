   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To plant is absolutely a matter of life in the Spirit, not a matter of mere teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is why Paul told us that when he came to Corinth the first time, he did not use enticing words of man's wisdom, but he exercised his spirit to demonstrate the Spirit 1 Cor 2:1-4 .</S>
