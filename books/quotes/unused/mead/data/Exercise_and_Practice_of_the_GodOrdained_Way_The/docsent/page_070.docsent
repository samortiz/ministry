   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Concerning Marriage</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another difficult question is regarding the matter of marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today on this earth there are a lot of illegal marriages.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Young men and young women live together as husband and wife, yet they were never married.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Are they husband and wife or not?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You may have a new one, a young lady, who was saved in a marvelous way, yet she lives with a young man without being married.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They may even have a child.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Eventually, this question concerning marriage will be brought up.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Are the two of them husband and wife?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What would you say?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you say "no," you will stumble them, but you cannot tell them that this is not a problem, because this is a big problem.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In China there is the problem of concubines.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One day I visited a home.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The husband got saved and baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His salvation was miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I did not know his situation, but I felt he was very good.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then one day I went to meet with him in his home, and there were four ladies there.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Eventually, by talking to them, I learned that these ladies were his four wives.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All of these four wives had been helped by this man to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I can testify from my heart that all five, the man and the four wives, loved the Lord Jesus, and they seemed to love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I was afraid that I would not be able to get out of that home without the matter of marriage being brought up.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How should one handle such a case?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I tried my best to avoid the four wives.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I only said, "It is wonderful to see that you all love the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They all were very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then I talked to them and encouraged them to love the Lord more, and to follow the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They all said, "Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After quite a long time, I said, "I have to go back home now."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They all agreed with me and sent me off; I got out of that snare.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then I went back to talk to the leading ones about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What should we have done concerning this man and the four wives?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a hard question, and even today I cannot tell you the best answer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One secret you have to learn and always remember is that you are dealing with babes.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I was there with one husband and four wives; all five were babes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the one hand, I was "playing" with them, but on the other hand, I was really helping them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>My visit did not stumble or damage them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If I had been careless and had been like a preacher, a pastor, or a Bible teacher, I surely would have damaged them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Just by my one visit, all five would have been stumbled.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, learn to hold home meetings always with the realization that you are dealing with babes.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This will safeguard you, and this will open the way for you to render the proper help to them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do not forget that the new ones were deeply fallen sinners, so it is not so easy for us to rescue them out of their fallen situation and condition in a quick way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some are not so complicated, but many cases are really complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the United States today, it is easy to meet a couple that has not been properly married.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They may live together and even have children.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Recently we encountered such a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When you go to a home meeting, you may find out strange things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is why you need to have the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you do not hold home meetings you cannot know the real living situation of these newly saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Learn to talk to people, treating them as babes all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you keep this one principle and learn this one secret, you will be safeguarded from offending and stumbling people.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Otherwise, many times you will unconsciously stumble the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After your visit, they would say, "Forget about it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I want nothing to do with Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I cannot take this religion."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They may not say this to your face, but after you leave, they will say it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Learn to talk to new ones as to babes.</S>
