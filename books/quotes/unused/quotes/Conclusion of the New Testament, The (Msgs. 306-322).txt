Through His redeeming blood, Christ has sanctified us, setting us apart unto God for the fulfillment of His purpose
It is through dispositional sanctification that the believers are being transformed from a natural disposition to a spiritual one
Although the blood of Christ separates us unto God positionally, it cannot accomplish anything in us with respect to the inner life
If we see this, we will realize that we must experience Christ as the Sanctifier both positionally and dispositionally
In 1 Corinthians 1:2 Paul equates, by the use of an appositive, 'those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus' with 'called saints'
We should have the boldness to say that we are holy, and we should praise the Lord for the fact that we are saints
Paul does not say that the Corinthians were sanctified in themselves; he declares that they had been sanctified in Christ Jesus
In his opening word of 1 Corinthians he addressed them as those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, and he called them saints
No matter where we may be when we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, Christ is both our portion and also the portion of all the saints
Verse 2 reveals that Christ as the all-inclusive One belongs to all believers and that all the believers jointly participate in Him
Colossians 1:12 says, 'Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you for a share of the allotted portion of the saints in the light'
All believers should be focused on Him, not being distracted by any gifted person, any overstressed doctrine, or any particular practice
Verse 9 says, 'God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord'
We should focus on Him as our unique center appointed by God so that all the problems among the believers may be solved
It means that we and Christ have become one, that we enjoy Christ and all He is and that He enjoys us and all we are
Whenever we are one spirit with the Lord, we are in the fellowship of Christ, and we experience Him as the all-inclusive One
In the New Testament, fellowship describes the flowing both between us and the Lord and between us and one another
Because we have been called into such a fellowship, we should not say that we are of Paul, of Cephas, of Apollos, or of any other person
God has only one center-Jesus Christ-and He has called us not into the denomination of our choice but into the fellowship of His Son
In summary, Paul in 1 Corinthians 1:1-9 impresses us with the fact that in God's economy, Christ is the unique center
God's intention is to make Christ His Son the center of His economy and also to make Him everything to all the believers
In His economy God's intention is to make Christ everything, to give Christ to us as our portion, and to work Christ into us
From man's perspective, a wise person would find ways to avoid crucifixion, yet the Christ who is the wisdom of God was crucified
It takes the power of God to defeat Satan, the world, sin, fallen man, the flesh, the natural life, the old creation, and the ordinances
Wisdom is for planning and purposing, whereas power is for carrying out and accomplishing what is planned and purposed
When we experience the crucified Christ, He becomes to us not only the power of God but also the wisdom of God
Since we have the crucified Christ as God's wisdom, there is no need for us to seek a way to carry out God's will
When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, as we are enjoying Him and experiencing Him, His crucifixion will terminate us
Christ crucified is not only the power but also the way for us to be delivered from the flesh, the natural life, and the old creation
Corinthians 1:24 says, 'To those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God'
Those who are called refers to the believers who were chosen by God in eternity and who believed in Christ in time
Christ is the power of God to carry out God's economy, and He is also the wisdom of God, the way of God, to carry out God's economy
Christ as the power of God strengthens us with a dynamic power, supplying and sustaining us in what we are and what we do
In all our circumstances and conditions, Christ as the power of God enables us to suffer, to bear burdens, and to stand firm
Christ as the wisdom of God flows unceasingly from God to us to be our present and practical wisdom in our experience
As we face certain problems and realize that we do not know how to handle them, we should apply Christ as our wisdom
If we have wisdom, we will know the proper way to do things, but if we are not wise, our way of doing things will be foolish
Wisdom in 1 Corinthians 1:30 is equal to the way in John 14:6, a verse in which the Lord Jesus says, 'I am the way'
Day by day and hour by hour we should live in the spirit and exercise the spirit to call on the name of the Lord Jesus
The expression to us from God indicates something present, practical, experiential, and ongoing in the way of transmission
Every day we need to be righteous, we need to be sanctified, and we need to be redeemed in all matters of our living
Now Christ is transmitted into us as our righteousness to take care of our past in order that in Him we would be accepted by God
Whenever we enjoy Christ and experience Him, we have Him as our righteousness not only objectively but also subjectively
As believers, we need not only to receive Christ as our righteousness but also to live Him as righteousness subjectively
In this way, we are no longer common; instead, we are sanctified, separated, marked out, and absolutely different from the worldly people
Christ as righteousness saved us in that when we believed in Christ and were justified in Him, we were regenerated in our spirit
Christ as sanctification is now transforming our soul, thereby making us holy, yet our body still remains unsaved
Christ as the redemption to us from God will transfigure our body of humiliation through His divine life into the body of His glory
We need to take the judgment of the cross in order that we can receive Christ as our redemption and be qualified to enjoy God's glory
When we enjoy Christ as our portion, we will experience Christ as our redemption and thus will be brought back to God
Christ not only will be our transfiguration in the future; He also is our present transfiguration, redemption, of our inner being
With regard to everything in our daily life, we need to be brought back to God, terminated, and replaced with Christ
In the church life we also need redemption because we are still very natural in many matters, such as our preference or care for the saints
When we believed into Christ and were baptized into Him, God put us into Him, and then Christ became wisdom to us
To be baptized is to be put into Christ, the embodiment of God, and in Christ we believers have all been baptized into the Triune God
As the transmission resumes, we enjoy Christ as our power, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption
Paul's word in 1 Corinthians 1:30 concerning our being in Christ is related to the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity
On the other hand, the more God in Christ has dispensed Himself into us, the more we are transferred into Christ experientially
From the standpoint of our position, we have already been transferred into Christ as the result of God's work, and we are now in Christ
God is continually seeking to dispense Christ into our being in order that we may be transferred into Christ experientially more and more
Corinthians 2:1-5 reveals that Christ who is our portion for our enjoyment is the content of the apostle's ministry
In the apostle's ministry, Christ is the mystery of God ministered to us, and Jesus Christ is the crucified One
Such a Christ is ministered not in persuasive words of wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, that is, the power of God
What the apostle testified was the mystery of God, which is Christ as the embodiment of God and the church as the expression of Christ
Today many preach about Christ and testify of Him, but most of those who preach Christ do not care for the church
In 1 Corinthians 2:2 Paul continues, 'I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified'
The crucified Christ is the unique subject, the center, the content, and the substance of the apostle's ministry
The expression this One crucified speaks of the example of the Lords living action work and way indicating His humiliation and abasement
He proclaimed not an honored, exalted, and glorified Christ, but a Christ who had been despised, rejected, and even crucified
We should learn to determine not to know anything among the saints except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified
In verse 5 Paul goes on to say, 'In order that your faith would not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God'
Corinthians 2:4 and 5 indicate that Paul did not exercise words of wisdom but the demonstration of the Spirit and of power
We need to remember that Paul spoke God's wisdom in a mystery to the Jews and the Greeks, both of whom were wisdom-seeking people
To these people who regarded themselves as wise, Paul did not preach superficial matters but the depths of God
God's wisdom is Christ , who is the hidden mystery , predestined, predesignated, and foreordained before the ages for our glory
God's wisdom in a mystery has not only been hidden but also predestined by God to become our destiny for our glory
Within God there is a mystery, Christ, and this mystery was predestined by God before the ages so that we may have glory
In eternity past God predestined Christ, God's wisdom, for our glory, and in eternity future, we will have glory
There is such a mystery, an economy, planned according to God's wisdom to put us, His chosen people, into Christ that we may be glorified
God in His wisdom has ordained and prepared for us many deep and hidden things, such as justification, sanctification, and glorification
The things God has prepared for those who love Him are far beyond human understanding; human beings simply cannot dream or imagine them
To fear God, to worship God, and to believe in God are all inadequate; to love Him is the indispensable requirement
In this way we have the closest and most intimate fellowship with God, and we are able to enter into His heart and apprehend all its secrets
In 1 Corinthians 2:6 Paul says that the wisdom he spoke was a wisdom not of this age nor of the rulers of this age
Paul says in verse 10, 'But to us God has revealed them through the Spirit, for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God'
The Spirit of God explores the depths of God concerning Christ and shows them to us in our spirit for our realization and participation
The more we pray-read with an exercised spirit, the more clearly we see a spiritual vision of the deep things of God
The Spirit of God who is in our spirit is at the same time in their spirit; this unveiling Spirit joins our spirit with their spirit
In order to know the depths of God, we must know that through incarnation God one day became a man named Jesus
Now, in resurrection, He is the life-giving Spirit who indwells our spirit and who has become one spirit with us
Nothing can be deeper than the last Adam becoming the life-giving Spirit and our being joined to the Lord as one spirit
We should praise the Lord that we, those who have been born of God by His Spirit, have received the Spirit of God
These depths can be realized and discerned, not by our philosophical mind but only by our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God
By means of the mingled spirit alone can we discern the depths of God, the different aspects of Christ as our portion for our enjoyment
If we exercise the mingled spirit, we will enjoy Christ, not in a superficial way but as the depths of God and even in the depths of God
We will enjoy Him in a way that eye has not seen, ear has not heard, mind has not thought, and heart has never imagined
In 1 Corinthians 3:11 Paul says, 'Another foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ'
When they were declaring that they were of Paul, Apollos, or Cephas, they were saying that these were their foundation and standing
We may have preferences in persons, matters, and things, and we need to see that to have a preference is to lay a foundation
Building upon the foundation already laid means that we must build upon the unique Christ practically and experientially
To fellowship with others with a living spirit full of the riches of Christ is to build upon the foundation already laid
According to 1 Corinthians 1:2 and 9, Christ is theirs and ours, and we have been called into the fellowship of Christ
In other words, all things are ours for the church, the church is for Christ to be His Body, and Christ is for God to be His expression
The all-inclusive Christ is God's center, God's centrality and universality, in the church as His fullness for His expression
We need to be touched by this center so that in every book and every chapter of the Bible, we would see Christ
The Passover was a feast in which the children of Israel enjoyed the roasted Passover lamb, the unleavened bread, and the bitter herbs
The entire Passover including the Passover lamb the unleavened bread and the bitter herbs is a type of the allinclusive Christ in redemption
The passover portrayed in Exodus 12 is an all-inclusive type of Christ as our redemption to begin our experience of God's salvation
To participate in the passover, the children of Israel had to enter into and remain in the houses that had been sprinkled with the blood
We should maintain our identification with Christ, with a constant realization that we are nothing and that He is everything
The flesh of the lamb signifies the crucified and resurrected life of Christ as the supply for God's redeemed people
In the reality of the passover, Christ's blood is drinkable, Christ's flesh is eatable, and Christ in totality is eatable
In Exodus 12:8 the children of Israel were given the proper way to eat the flesh of the passover lamb, roasted with fire
To eat Christ 'roasted with fire' is to believe that on the cross Christ suffered for us under God's holy wrath exercised in His judgment
In Exodus 12:8 the children of Israel were to eat the flesh of the lamb with unleavened bread and bitter herbs
In 1 Corinthians 5:7 Paul charges us to purge out the old leaven that we may be a new lump, even as we are unleavened
The entire Christian life should be such a feast, such an enjoyment of Christ as our banquet, the rich supply of life
The only way to eliminate sin is to daily eat Christ as the crucified, resurrected, and sinless life, signified by the unleavened bread
The Christian life is a feast of unleavened bread, a feast of the enjoyment of Christ as our life supply without any leaven
The unleavened bread signifies the sinless Christ who is to be dispensed into us, His believers, as the unleavened element
Christ as the unleavened bread became our unleavened food to reconstitute us so that we may become a new lump, the church
As the unleavened bread He causes us to be unleavened constitutionally, making us a new lump, a lump without leaven
The children of Israel did not live individualistically; on the contrary, they lived, camped, traveled, and fought battles together
Since we are what we eat, if we eat unleavened bread, we will eventually become constituted with unleavened bread
All these items of God's salvation were accomplished in us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of God
In the New Testament the expression in the name of the Lord actually means in the person of the Lord, because the name denotes the person
Washing sanctifying and justifying are not merely outward objective and positional rather they are inward subjective and dispositional
If a person with a certain name does not exist, the name is in vain, but when we call a living person by name, that person responds
Since the name is the person and the person is the Spirit, when we call on the name of the Lord, He comes to us as the Spirit
When we cease to call on the Lord, the subjective experience of the washing, sanctifying, and justifying is no longer ours
Not only have we been saved and redeemed; we are even one spirit with the Lord, and as a result, we have the divine life and nature
We all need to humble ourselves before the Lord and pray: 'Lord, show us the vision that we are one spirit with You
Such a union with the resurrected Christ can only be in our spirit because Christ today is the lifegiving Spirit and is now with our spirit
The Christian life is not a religious life or an ethical life; rather, it is a life of being one spirit with the Lord
According to God's New Testament economy, the Lord desires to come into us, to become one with us, and to make us one with Him
We need to pray to the Lord in the morning: 'I thank You for another day in which to practice being one spirit with You
The more we are one spirit with Him in our daily living, the more we will enjoy salvation, sanctification, and transformation
These verses indicate that believers inwardly should be slaves only of Christ; they should not become slaves of men
The expression spiritual food refers to manna , typifying Christ as our daily life supply for the Christian journey
Manna signifies that Christ as the heavenly food is to be dispensed into us for our nourishment in order to constitute us a heavenly people
Food is anything we take into us for our satisfaction, and the food we eat enters into us organically and becomes our constitution
While the children of Israel journeyed for forty years in the wilderness, the divine diet replaced their Egyptian diet
As we partake of Him as our heavenly food day by day, He is reconstituting us to change our inward constitution
We should all drink the same spiritual drink and should not drink anything other than the all-inclusive Spirit
When we go to those places, He does not give up on us; rather, He still follows us with a purpose of bringing us back under His leading
On the other hand, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness for forty years, the Lord was following these foolish people
Today we need to know that as the spiritual rock Christ is following us, who often foolishly wander in the wilderness of our soul
Through these years of wandering, our real condition-our sinfulness, our unfaithfulness, and our shortage of the living water-was exposed
The Christ who follows us as the spiritual rock flows out the life-giving Spirit as the living water to satisfy our thirst
The fact that the spiritual rock followed the children of Israel indicates that they were not obedient to the Lord
In 1 Corinthians 10:16 Paul says, 'The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the fellowship of the blood of Christ?
The word fellowship refers to the believers' communion in the joint participation in the blood and body of Christ
The apostle's thought here is to illustrate how eating and drinking make the eaters and drinkers one with what they eat and drink
When we come to the Lord's table, we come to a feast of two courses, His blood and His body, both of which are for the believers' fellowship
The Lord's table is not only a matter of meeting on the Lord's Day; this table should be our enjoyment every day, even continually
Exodus 12 reveals that at the passover the children of Israel held a feast, through which they were saved by eating the passover lamb
It was through eating the flesh of the lamb that they obtained energy to walk out of Egypt and to pass through the Red Sea
The offerings are types of Christ; as the Lamb of God , Christ is the totality, the aggregate, of all the offerings
The offerings signify God in Christ for us to enjoy and even to eat, digest, and assimilate that we may be mingled with God
The more we enjoy Christ as such a diet the more we will be nourished qualified strengthened and supported to serve God in a priestly way
Psalm 36:8-9 also unveils that we may eat Christ as the fatness of God's house and drink the Spirit as the river of God's pleasure
They are saturated with the fatness of Your house, / And You cause them to drink of the river of Your pleasures
The fatness of God's house comes from the sacrifices, the offerings, all of which typify the all-inclusive Christ
Psalm 36:8-9 reveals the Divine Trinity in His divine dispensing as the enjoyment of God's people in His house
In the New Testament the Lord Jesus called people to come to Him both to eat Him as the bread of life and to drink Him as the living water
The tree of life is mentioned not only at the beginning of the Bible in Genesis it is also mentioned at the end of the Bible in Revelation
We are enjoying the crucified and resurrected Christ as the tree of life, the food supply in our spirit, as a foretaste today in the church
In 1 Corinthians 10:17 Paul says, 'Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one Body; for we all partake of the one bread'
On the one hand, the bread signifies the Lord's physical body that He gave for us on the cross in order to impart His life into us
In this one loaf we see that all the children of God are one; all the members of Christ's mystical Body are represented in the loaf
The Lord fell into the earth and died as a grain of wheat and then in resurrection became a loaf composed of many grains
The bread signifies not only our participation in the life of Christ but also the fellowship of the Body of Christ
The Lord's body, signified by the bread, and the Lord's blood, signified by the cup, compose the table of the Lord
Originally, there was such a headship in the universe, a headship that maintained a proper order in God's creation
Our enjoyment of Christ as our head brings us under the headship of God and sets up a proper order between man and woman
We should enjoy Christ in His headship in order that we may be under the headship of God and man may be the proper head over woman
The archangel with his subordinates rebelled against Gods headship establishing his kingdom of darkness and became Satan Gods adversary
When we enjoy Christ as our Head, this enjoyment brings us under God's headship and sets up the order between man and woman
In Revelation we see that Christ, the slain Lamb, is absolutely under the headship of God for the carrying out of God's administration
In the midst of all this rebellion, there is a Body composed of those who have been redeemed and baptized into the Triune God
Corinthians 11:23-26 indicates that we may experience and enjoy Christ as the object of the believers' remembrance
At the Lord's table we receive His body and blood for our enjoyment; at the Lord's supper we give Him our remembrance for His enjoyment
having given thanks, He broke it and said, This is My body, which is given for you; this do unto the remembrance of Me'
The bread is broken that we may eat it, for concerning the bread, the Lord said in Matthew 26:26, 'Take, eat; this is My body'
The bread in 1 Corinthians 11:23 signifies the Lord's body that was broken for us on the cross in order to be distributed to us as bread
Eating the bread signifies taking the Lord in to digest and assimilate Him organically that He may become life to us
When we take in Christ as our food and thoroughly digest and assimilate Him into us, we are truly mingled with Him
The new covenant, a covenant of full blessing, was established by the Lord's blood, which He shed on the cross for our redemption
The blood of Christ instituted a new covenant, a better covenant , which became the new testament after His resurrection
Participation in the Lord's supper will surely produce a result-a continual remembrance of the Lord for His satisfaction
Christ is the object of the believers' remembrance for them to eat and drink, declaring His death until He comes
At the Lord's supper we partake of the bread and the cup as the symbols of His body and His blood in order to enjoy Him
We long to eat and drink e'en more, To take Thyself in spirit thus, Till Thou shalt all our being fill And true remembrance have from us
Our remembering the Lord in such a way declares to the whole universe that we daily enjoy Him as our food and drink
On the first day of every week, we need to come together to remember Him by enjoying Him, that is, by eating and drinking Him
Whenever we eat the bread and drink the cup, we simultaneously remember the Lord and display His redeeming and life-releasing death
In 1 Corinthians 11:26 Paul says, 'As often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you declare the Lord's death until He comes'
We remember the Lord Himself by declaring and displaying His death to the entire universe: to the demons, to the angels, and to human beings
The bread refers to the Lord's body, and the cup refers to His blood; the separation of the body and the blood signifies death
We should display the Lord's death and thus remember Him in the spirit and atmosphere of waiting for His coming
When our body of humiliation is transfigured into the body of His glory at His coming , our redemption will be complete
By His first coming the Lord accomplished His death to carry out an all-inclusive redemption for the producing of the church
To declare the Lord's death until He comes may imply the declaring of the existence of the church for the bringing in of the kingdom
Paul says in 1:4, 'I thank my God always concerning you based upon the grace of God which was given to you in Christ Jesus'
Apart from the resurrected Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit, the grace of God cannot reach us, and we cannot participate in it
Apart from being processed in resurrection to become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, God cannot be eaten and enjoyed by us
God in creation is for our worship, but God in resurrection is not only for our worship but also for our enjoyment
The Jews know how to worship God only as their Creator; however, we enjoy our Triune God as the life-giving Spirit
Christ passed through incarnation, through thirty-three and a half years of human living, and through six hours of crucifixion
Christ, the grace of God, is now in resurrection as the life-giving Spirit, the consummation of the processed Triune God
Resurrection means that all the old, natural things have been terminated and that something new and spiritual has been germinated
It is by this grace that Saul of Tarsus the foremost of sinners became the foremost apostle laboring more abundantly than all the apostles
All the disciples and apostles who saw the resurrected Christ not only saw Him objectively but also experienced Him subjectively
Not only was Christ Himself resurrected objectively, but in resurrection He lived in Peter, John, and all the other apostles and disciples
We should not be the ones working; rather, the grace of God, the resurrected Christ who lives in us, should be the One working
When we put together these three aspects of Christ, we see that Christ is the first, the second, and the last; as such, Christ is everything
Concerning these aspects of Christ, we must not only learn the truth and see the vision but also have the experience
In 1 Corinthians 15:20 Paul says, 'Now Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep'
Christ is the firstfruits of resurrection to be the beginning of God's new creation and to be the Head of the Body, the church
By His all-inclusive death He terminated the old creation; in His resurrection He germinated the new creation with the divine life
Christ as the firstfruits of resurrection is the Firstborn from the dead that He might be the Head of the Body
Colossians 1:18a tells us that Christ is the Head of the Body, the church; He is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead
According to human understanding, tradition, and practice, we should follow the one who is first, not the one who is second
So also it is written, 'The first man, Adam, became a living soul'; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit'
Christ being the last Adam means that He terminated Adam, whereas Christ being the second man indicates that He is a new beginning
The old man is the representative, the center, of the old creation; hence, by destroying the old man Christ terminated the old creation
According to 1 Corinthians 15:45, the first man, Adam, became a living soul, and the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit
The old creation was created by God, whereas the new creation comes into being not by creation but by resurrection
After dying on the cross, the last Adam, our Redeemer, became in resurrection the life-giving Spirit to impart Himself into us as life
Now He is the Spirit who gives life, the Spirit who imparts life to us, the Spirit who dispenses Himself as life into the believers
All these elements have been brought into the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, the consummation of the Triune God
Corinthians unveils that the Christ who is the portion of all believers and into whose fellowship we have been called is all-inclusive
As such an all-inclusive One, He is now the life-giving Spirit, the totality of all that He is for our experience and enjoyment
If there were no resurrection, Christ would still be in the tomb, and it would not be possible for Him to reign
In Matthew 28:18 the Lord Jesus said to the disciples, 'All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth'
Now under His reign we must disciple the nations, bringing the nations into His kingdom and making them His people
Eventually, at the end of the millennium, the last age of the old creation, every enemy will have been put under the feet of Christ
On the one hand, to us as God's chosen people, Christ in resurrection is the life-giving Spirit imparting life to us
On the other hand, to the nations, Christ in His resurrection has become the reigning King executing God's administration
His Body must cooperate with Him in His resurrection life and resurrection authority so that the church may be headed up
Eventually, at the end of the millennium, after the end of all the ages and dispensations, God's administration will be fully accomplished
There will be the new heaven and new earth, and we will be in the New Jerusalem enjoying Christ and reigning with Him over the nations
As we enjoy Him in one aspect after another, we will realize that the all-inclusive Christ is an unlimited feast
In this message we will begin to consider aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ as revealed in 2 Corinthians
Sufferings does not refer to sufferings for Christ; rather, it refers to Christ's own sufferings as shared by His disciples
When we say Amen before God to the fact that Christ is the Yes, the fulfillment, of all the promises of God, God is glorified through us
He defended himself and his co-workers by saying that God is faithful so that the word of their preaching was not yes and no
The word of the apostles' preaching in 1:18, that is, their word toward the Corinthians, was their message concerning Christ
From the first time he came to the Corinthians until the writing of this Epistle, his preaching sounded the same note
The apostles' preaching of Christ never changed; likewise, in our preaching concerning Christ, we should never change our tune
Although we have encountered much opposition to this ministry, today in our preaching of Christ, we still sound the same note
The anointing is the moving of the ointment, that is, the moving and working of the all-inclusive life-giving, Spirit within us
In our experience the extent to which we have been attached to Christ depends on the amount of anointing we have received
Day by day the anointing Spirit anoints us with the ingredients and the constituents of God, the elements of God Himself
If we experience the sealing Spirit, when others contact us, they will have the sense that God has been formed within us
The Spirit is the pledge of our inheritance that guarantees that we will receive the full taste of God Himself as our divine inheritance
The Spirit also transmits the things in eternity and in the New Jerusalem to us because He is the eternal Spirit
The Spirit transmits all the heavenly things and elements of Christ into us, not for our mental knowledge but for our taste and enjoyment
As believers, we have the Holy Spirit as the anointing, the seal, and the pledge, all of which are for our full enjoyment of Christ
Because we have been anointed and sealed and have received the pledge, we are now qualified and equipped to live the unchanging Christ
The expression the Spirit of the Lord, however, indicates that the Spirit and the Lord are in apposition to each other
16 is the Spirit who pervades and animates the new covenant of which we are ministers , and the ministration of which is with glory
Throughout the centuries there have been a number of teachers who believed that, according to verse 17, Christ the Lord is the Spirit
We cannot deny what the book of Revelation says concerning the seven Spirits, that the third of the Trinity is the eyes of the second
The Spirit who is the ultimate expression of the Triune God was not yet in John 739 because at that time Jesus had not yet been glorified
Later the Lord appeared to one of the strongest Judaizers, Saul of Tarsus, called him, and brought him out of the bondage of the law
Now the Spirit of the Lord is with us, and we have full liberty, full freedom, from the bondage of the Old Testament code of the law
The Lord being the Spirit is to free us from regulations, rituals, religious teachings, and traditional doctrines
Today, however, is not the age of the law of letters but the age of the Lord Jesus being the pneumatic Christ, the Spirit
Because the Lord is the Spirit who gives freedom, when the heart turns to Him, the heart is freed from the bondage of the letter of the law
Paul tells us that whenever the heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away and that wherever the Spirit is, there is freedom
It is by the Spirit of the Lord that we look unto the Lord with an unveiled face to be transformed into His image from the Lord Spirit
On the one hand, they may restrain us from being wild; on the other hand, they actually bind us and even kill us spiritually
Again, this expression strongly proves and confirms that the Lord Christ is the Spirit and the Spirit is the Lord Christ
The preposition from here indicates that transformation is proceeding from the Spirit rather than being caused by Him
In order for the Spirit to do His transforming work in us, there is the need for a certain essence to be dispensed into us by the Spirit
Today we are being transformed into His image from one stage of glory to another, until eventually we will be the same as He
The Spirit's work in transforming us involves a change in our whole being-in life, nature, essence, element, form, and appearance
Transformation is not outward change, correction, or adjustment; transformation is altogether an inward, metabolic change of our being
To be transformed into the same image is to be conformed to the resurrected and glorified Christ, to be made the same as He is
When we behold and reflect the glory of the Lord, He infuses us with the element of what He is and what He has done
The result is that we are being transformed metabolically to have His life shape by His life power with His life essence
In 2 Corinthians 3:18 we have the thought of being transformed into the same image, the image of the resurrected and glorified Christ
Based upon this fact and upon Paul's use of the word transformed, we may speak of being metabolically constituted into the image of Christ
In 2 Corinthians 3:18 Paul also tells us that we are being transformed into the same image 'from glory to glory'
In John 17:1 the Lord Jesus prayed, 'Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You'
Because a carnation seed dies when it is sown into the soil, we may say that its blossoming is its resurrection
To be transformed from glory to glory far surpasses a mere outward improvement of behavior according to religious or ethical teachings
The image of God refers to Christ as our outward expression, whereas the treasure refers to Christ as our inward content
The expression the image of the invisible God implies that although God Himself is invisible, His image is visible
John 1:18 says, 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
In 2 Corinthians 44 Paul says that the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ who is the image of God might not shine on them
God is the image, the image is Christ, Christ is the glory, the glory is the gospel, and the gospel is the illumination
When the gospel came to us, it came to us by shining, and this shining brought into us Christ, who is the image of the processed Triune God
Many believers can testify that when they heard Christ as the gospel, a certain impression of Christ entered into them
What has been illuminated into our being is a living person, the Triune God embodied in Christ, who is the image, the expression, of God
We need to see that the gospel of the glory of Christ first shines into us, and then it shines out from within us
Corinthians 44 speaking of the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ refers to four matters illumination gospel glory and Christ
By calling on the Lord we are brought into face-to-face contact with Him and experience God's shining in our heart
Whenever we call on the Lord in a dear, intimate way, we are before His face, and the shining of God is in our heart
In 2 Corinthians 4:7 Paul says, 'We have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us'
God's shining in our hearts brings into us a treasure, the Christ of glory, who is the embodiment of God to be our life and our everything
Because of the shining in our hearts, we have this treasure, a treasure that is wonderful, precious, and marvelous
The Christ of glory as the excellent treasure is received by the believers through the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ
Since we have Christ as the treasure, the most excellent One and the most lovely One, we do not love the world
It is not that we should not love the world but that the world is inferior to the treasure, the excellent and lovely Christ
We need to note that according to verse 6 the illumination of the knowledge of the glory of God is in the face of Jesus Christ
When we experience the glory of God shining in the face of Jesus Christ, this shining brings into us Christ as the image of God
Now this treasure becomes the source of the power energizing us and enabling us to shine forth God's glory and to manifest the truth
According to Hebrews 1:3, Christ is the effulgence of God's glory; that is, He is the expression of the image of God
Christ's loving death was the motivating factor of the apostles' being constrained to live a loving life for Him
Since Christ died as our Substitute, suffering the sentence of death on behalf of us all, in the eyes of God we all died
At times we may be reluctant to go along with Him because certain things in the world distract us from the Lord
It is this love-not a mere teaching, religion, or ritual-that constrains us to drop so many distracting things in the world
The constraining love of Christ in 2 Corinthians 5:14 is the love which was manifested on the cross through His death for us
To one end, to forcibly limit, to confine to one object within certain bounds, to shut up to one line and purpose'
When we are thus constrained, we are limited, as if walking on a narrow, walled road, and we are forced to go in a certain direction
When the flood waters come, we do not have a choice as to whether we will receive them or not; they give us no choice
We need to pray day by day that the Lord would show us His love so that we would be constrained by the love of Christ
To live to ourselves means that we are under our own control, direction, and governing and that we care for our own aims and goals
If we consider the context, we will see that to live to the Lord in 5:15 means to live the kind of life the Lord Jesus lived
He wants us to experience the putting to death of Jesus so that our natural man and our active being may be terminated
When Christ as the life-giving Spirit entered into us, we were germinated with the Triune God to become the new creation
Before our regeneration we did not have the divine life, but through regeneration God imparted Himself into us and became our life
Anything in our daily life that does not have God in it is the old creation, but what has God in it is part of the new creation
The old things of the flesh have passed away through the death of Christ, and all has become new in Christ's resurrection
The believers are a new creation, not according to the old nature of the flesh but according to the new nature of the divine life
Corinthians 5:18-21 reveals the complete reconciliation of the believers to God, and Christ as the means of this reconciliation
In this way, the apostles were commissioned with the ministry of reconciliation, a ministry to bring others fully back to God
On the other hand, God carries out this work of reconciliation through the apostles who are fully reconciled to God through Christ
In this aspect He was made sin for us to be judged and done away with by God that we might become the righteousness of God in Him
In ancient times when the children of Israel came to contact God they needed to pass through two veils in order to enter the Holy of Holies
The first veil is called 'the screen,' which was the curtain at the entrance of the tabernacle, that is, the entrance to the Holy Place
A sinner who was brought to God through the reconciliation of the propitiating blood entered into the Holy Place by passing this screen
The Corinthian believers have been reconciled to God, having passed through the first veil and having entered into the Holy Place
On the other hand, the reconciling Spirit was working on them in order to bring them through the veil into the Holy of Holies
The goal of this Epistle was to bring them there that they might be persons in the spirit , in the Holy of Holies
Now in order to have God Himself, we need to be reconciled further by the Lord and come into the Holy of Holies
He exposes our natural life and unveils our real situation to us so that we may condemn our natural being and apply the cross subjectively
In this step the veil of our natural man is rent so that we may be in the Holy of Holies, living in God's presence
You may be very good, nice, pious, holy, and spiritual, yet you know that there is still something separating you from God's presence
In 2 Corinthians 5:21 Paul says, 'Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of God in Him'
In the organic union with Christ, those who have been reconciled to God in the second step become the very righteousness of God
Christ died on the cross not only for our sins, but He died also for us, for our flesh, our natural being, our outward man
Christ died on the cross so that our outward man, our natural being, may be terminated in order that we may become God's righteousness
When Christ became a man in the flesh , He was made sin on our behalf to be judged by God that we might become God's righteousness in Him
The expression in Him in 2 Corinthians 5:21 means in union with Him not only positionally but also organically in resurrection
In the organic union with Christ, those who have been brought back to God in the Holy of Holies are made the righteousness of God
In 2 Corinthians 5:21 Paul says that Christ was made sin on our behalf so that we might become God's righteousness in Him
When He was crucified, He brought our natural man-the outward man, the flesh, and sin-to the cross and nailed it there
Now in Christ we, having been brought thoroughly back to God, may enjoy Christ to such an extent that in Him we become God's righteousness
The highest authority is Christ as the Head, and we as members of the Body must be representatives of the Head, His ambassadors
According to 2 Corinthians 5:20, Paul and his co-workers who were fully reconciled to God were the ambassadors of Christ
We need to experience and enjoy Christ as the means of reconciliation to the fullest extent so that we may become His ambassadors
Apparently, the Lord Jesus becoming poor has nothing to do with the ministry of material supply to needy saints
How could He be the grace working within us, motivating, strengthening, and supplying us to carry on a ministry to the needy saints?
If He had never lived in Nazareth in that poor environment to be a poor carpenter, how could He be our riches?
If we take His grace as our enjoyment, spontaneously we will do the same thing Christ did-become poor for others
As the ambassador of Christ, he lived and behaved by Christ in His human virtues, such as meekness, forbearance, and truthfulness
He did not ride into Jerusalem proudly on a horse; rather, He came mounted on a little donkey, even a small colt
In reality He was the heavenly King, but He had no intention to come as a great king fighting or competing with others
In 2 Corinthians 10:1 Paul says that he entreats the Corinthian believers through the meekness and gentleness of Christ
The phrase through the meekness and gentleness of Christ indicates that Paul was one with Christ and that he took Christ as his life
He entreated the believers not by himself but through the virtues of Christ, particularly through Christ's meekness and forbearance
To have the virtue of meekness is not to invade others or fight with them; instead, it is to be willing to give in to others
To have meekness is not to invade others but to give in to them; to have gentleness is to be willing to be invaded by others
We may be meek and gentle, but we need to consider whether or not our meekness and gentleness are something of Christ
In order to live in His meekness and gentleness, we need Christ to be wrought into us so that His meekness and gentleness can be ours
Because Paul realized that he was one with Christ, he also realized that he had the virtues of Christ's human life
We need to learn the truth that Christ is the one Husband and that we should betroth others to Christ as one Husband
If you behave yourself as a man before Christ, you insult the Lord's headship; you must behave yourself as a virgin before the Lord
God has a jealous heart, an envying heart, toward us because He wants us to be solely for Him and to turn toward Him
As long as we have been brought as a pure virgin to this Husband and love Him, appreciate Him, and belong to Him, we will be preserved
In 2 Corinthians 12:9 the Lord said to Paul, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness'
We must all love our weaknesses because our weaknesses become the very site in which the grace of Christ as His power is perfected
The weaker we are, the more we will realize the sufficient grace that constantly strengthens us into the inner man
It is because of our weaknesses that the Lord's power has the ground to manifest itself and that we are able to enjoy His power
When we are weak and realize that apart from Him we can do nothing, the Lord has the ground in us and can do everything for us
Without the thorn Paul would not realize how weak he was; with the thorn in the flesh he needed the Lord to be his grace
The Lord left the thorn with Paul so that he would experience His overshadowing power perfected in his weakness
Like the apostle Paul, we also should boast in our weaknesses that the power of Christ might tabernacle over us
The grace of Christ is the power perfected in weakness that, as a tent or a tabernacle spread over us, overshadows us in our weakness
It portrays how the power of Christ, even Christ Himself, dwells upon us as a tent spread over us, overshadowing us in our weaknesses
In 2 Corinthians 13:4 Paul continues, 'For indeed He was crucified out of weakness, but He lives by the power of God'
Corinthians 13:4 goes on to say, 'For indeed we are weak in Him, but we will live together with Him by the power of God directed toward you'
The apostle told the Corinthian believers that although he was weak in Christ, he lived by the power of God directed toward the believers
If one is in the objective faith he surely has the subjective faith believing in Christ and the entire content of Gods New Testament economy
In 2 Corinthians 1314 Paul says The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all
If we desire to know Him, we must know the Spirit, because the Father is in the Son, and the Son is the Spirit
The love of God the Father is the source, the fountain; and the grace of Christ is the flow, the expression, of love
Grace is actually the Triune God embodied in Christ and transmitted into our being through the Spirit for our enjoyment
We have the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit as the full enjoyment of the Triune God
While we are enjoying the fellowship of the Spirit, we also enjoy the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God
The fellowship of the Holy Spirit issues in the grace of Christ, and in the grace of Christ we receive the love of God
We have the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit-the full enjoyment of the Triune God
The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the hypostases, the supporting substances, that compose the one Godhead
