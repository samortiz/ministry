   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONFESSING OUR SINS ONE BY ONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ACCORDING TO THE LORD S LEADING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we consecrate ourselves in this way, we are open to the Lord and our whole being is turned to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then the true and living Lord will immediately begin a sweeping and emptying work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We do not know the situation of our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Most young people are filled with many things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should ask ourselves whether we are clean and whether we are empty.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On one hand, we are empty without the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the other hand, we are not empty, but rather we are full of all kinds of things other than the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, when we consecrate ourselves to the Lord, He will begin to touch us within.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He will check with us concerning the things that fill us, item by item.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whatever the Lord touches, we should confess and deal with.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We first consecrate ourselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then we deal with our sins according to the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we enter into the Lord s presence and consecrate ourselves to Him, He will do a cleansing work within us to deal with the filthy things that occupy us, such as jealousy or despising others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even while we are wearing gospel vests, we may be jealous of others or may despise others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These things are sins.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some of our sins are more serious than others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We may have problems with our parents.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord knows our inward situation much better than we do.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, when we consecrate ourselves to the Lord, He will operate in us, touching our sins and causing us to be conscious of them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whenever we have a feeling concerning a sin, the Lord is touching us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord is the living Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we consecrate ourselves to Him, He will touch our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When He touches our sins, we should not hide, for it is only then that we realize the value of His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As the Lord touches us, we will feel condemned within, and our conscience will not be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Immediately, we should hide under His blood and ask Him to cleanse us with His precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we confess one sin, we will become conscious of another sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then we should ask the Lord to forgive this sin and cleanse us from it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then we will become conscious of a third sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should follow this inner sense to confess and deal with our sins one by one, applying the cleansing of the Lord s precious blood to each sin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order to be beside ourselves, we must have a thorough dealing of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>BEING EMPTIED AND ALLOWING THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>TO OCCUPY US</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After we confess our sins, the Lord will empty us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A cup that is full of water cannot contain anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In order for the cup to contain juice, the water must be poured out.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After we deal with our sins, the Lord will show us that He does not occupy much space within us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, we will need to consecrate ourselves again.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is a continual consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whatever the Lord touches, we should give to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Sometimes we are emptied, but we are still not willing to give Him the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is not doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As we give ourselves to the Lord and fellowship with Him, He will demand more ground within us, and He will occupy us more.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He desires to occupy our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We cannot be our own lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He wants to be the Lord and to occupy every part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we are willing to consecrate ourselves to the Lord, we will have such experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>HAVING PERSONAL TRANSACTIONS WITH THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In order to consecrate ourselves to the Lord, confess our sins, be emptied, and let the Lord occupy us, we must have transactions with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is good for us to pray together in groups, but sometimes it is necessary for us to go to the Lord individually.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Consecration is an individual matter; others cannot consecrate for us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must go to the Lord ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must personally take care of consecrating ourselves to the Lord, receiving His shining and dealing, and letting Him occupy our being.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There are advantages to praying or pray-reading with others, and there is some enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, in order to consecrate ourselves to the Lord for Him to gain us, we must have personal transactions with the Lord and hand ourselves over to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some may have done this before, but they must do it again.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It does not matter how many times we have consecrated ourselves in the past, we need to do it again.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In order to be filled with the Lord, who today is the Spirit, we must consecrate ourselves again to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is a very crucial matter.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must consecrate ourselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>BELIEVING THAT WE ARE FILLED</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After we consecrate ourselves to the Lord and He touches our sins, we should confess our sins and ask Him to cleanse us with His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should follow His leading to be emptied of improper things so that He can gain ground in us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then we should believe that the Lord will fill us and not rely on our feelings, expecting something to be poured on us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we depend on our feelings, we can be deceived by the Lord s enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>After we consecrate ourselves to the Lord, confess our sins, are emptied, and give the Lord the ground in us, we should not wait to be filled.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Thinking that we need to wait is a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must walk by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Since we have consecrated ourselves to the Lord, confessed our sins, and let the Lord gain ground in us, the Lord will fill us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We should just thank and praise Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We should believe that we are filled and not depend on our feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>SPEAKING, SINGING, AND PRAISING</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>WITH ALL THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we believe, we will be filled with joy and rejoice such that we can gather with other saints and praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>To consecrate ourselves to the Lord is to have many transactions with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The issue of these transactions is that we can praise Him together with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Ephesians 5:18 speaks of being filled in spirit, and verse 19 says, Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In verse 19 there are not only psalms and hymns but also spiritual songs, and there is not only speaking but also singing.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Speaking is mentioned before singing.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Speaking stresses mutuality, whereas singing is toward God and for God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The more we speak and sing, the more we are filled with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Moreover, singing is to drink of the Spirit, that is, to drink of the Lord 1 Cor 12:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We have been baptized into one Spirit, and now we have been given to drink of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>To drink of Him is to be filled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We drink Him by consecrating ourselves, confessing our sins, being emptied, allowing Him to gain ground in us, believing that He has filled us, and praising Him.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The more we praise, the more we are filled.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>At this time we will be beside ourselves in a genuine way.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>THOROUGHLY TAKING CARE OF CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The way for us to be beside ourselves begins with consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We should go before the Lord personally and take care of our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We should each go to the Lord and consecrate ourselves thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We should deal with our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We should yield to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We may be able to deceive others, but we can never deceive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>It is only after we have thoroughly consecrated ourselves that we can be genuinely beside ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Otherwise, our actions will be a mere performance.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We must spend the time to thoroughly consecrate ourselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We must give ourselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This is not a matter of being stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If we truly desire to enjoy the Lord as the meaning of our human life, we must take care of our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We cannot avoid consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We should never be in a hurry before the Lord and say, Lord, I give myself to You.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We need to spend at least half an hour with Him and thoroughly take care of our consecration, letting Him shine in us, operate in us, and search us.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>As He touches different items, we should deal with them and give them to Him, allowing Him to occupy us inch by inch.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Eventually, we will be unloaded of our burdens, and spontaneously we will say, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The Lord has gained ground in me.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>There is no hindrance in me toward the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>There is no longer the hindrance of sins or of other things.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>The Lord has the ground in me.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>At this time it will be easy for us to believe that the Lord is filling us, and we will praise Him.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Our singing will be different because we will have a craziness that is the issue of our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>We should all have such transactions with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Our consecration is the beginning of our being searched by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>May all the saints not wait but take care of this critical experience in our spiritual life.</S>
