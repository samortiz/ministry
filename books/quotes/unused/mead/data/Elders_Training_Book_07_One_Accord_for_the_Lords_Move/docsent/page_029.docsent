   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Paul s Leadership in Acts 13 28 The Problem with Barnabas</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the last section of Acts all the churches acted and moved according to Paul s teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When Paul began his ministry, he was the youngest one among the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Barnabas was the brother who brought Paul into practical fellowship with the disciples in Jerusalem Acts 9:26-27 and who brought Paul into the ministry Acts 11:22, 25-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul owed Barnabas so much.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Barnabas was a senior and Paul was a junior.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Eventually, both of them were sent from Antioch Acts 13:2-4 , and by being sent they became the apostles, the sent ones Acts 14:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the initiation of their apostolic ministry, Barnabas s name was mentioned first 13:2, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At a certain point, however, Saul s name was changed to Paul, and he began to speak 13:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From that time, Paul took the lead in the apostolic ministry all the way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul was following the lead of Barnabas, but at a certain point there was the need for someone to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Probably while Barnabas was wondering what to say, Paul rose up and spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From that time Paul went on to speak a lot, and he took over the leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They were sent again from Antioch by the church to Jerusalem to solve the problem of circumcision Acts 15:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After returning to Antioch and encouraging the saints with the solution to this problem, they prepared to go out on their second journey.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Barnabas proposed to bring his cousin Mark, but Paul would not agree, and there was a contention between them Acts 15:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Who would you agree with?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Barnabas was older than Paul, more qualified and experienced, and the one who brought Paul into the fellowship and the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Which opinion would you have taken?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Surely we would have taken the opinion from the one who was older, more experienced, and from the one who brought the other into the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After this contention between Barnabas and Paul, they separated from each other, and Barnabas no longer appears in the divine record in Acts of the Lord s move in God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What was the reason for Barnabas s making such an issue?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The reason was that Barnabas was the initiator of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But at a certain point, the divine revelation went to Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Barnabas did not have the portion of God s revelation that Paul did.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The older and more experienced Barnabas, though, wanted to propose something for their second journey, not based upon the revelation, the vision, but based upon probably some kind of natural relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Barnabas decided to separate from Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was taking the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>While they were on their journey, though, God s revelation went to the younger one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Barnabas, the older one, probably still thought he was taking the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If he were not assuming the leadership, he surely would have listened to Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Barnabas assumed at least a part of the leadership, if not in full.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Smoothness with Aquila and Priscilla</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Aquila and Priscilla were very much for the Lord, but when they came in, they came into the flow of the Lord s move under the one leadership, the leadership of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the beginning of Acts 18 we can see this vv.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Problem with Apollos</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But at the end of the same chapter another one came in by the name of Apollos vv.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>24-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Apollos was a man who had a lot of Bible knowledge and who was gifted in expounding the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many people received help from his teaching of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to my study of the holy Word, this man never got into the flow that was going on through Paul s teaching, so he was never under the one leadership of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This was the reason why some in Corinth were able to say, I am of Apollos 1 Cor 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A kind of competition and rivalry was there.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If Apollos had gotten into the flow of the Lord s move under Paul s teaching and under Paul s leadership, I do not think anyone would have put him into a rivalry with Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Peter was in the leadership in the first section of the Acts, and Paul was in another leadership in the second section of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But there is no hint in the Bible that Apollos had any leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In 1 Corinthians Paul was humble.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He said, What then is Apollos?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>And what is Paul?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Ministers through whom you believed, even as the Lord gave to each one.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow 3:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>His illustration, however, still shows he is in the leadership because he tells us he is a planter.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A waterer is much less important than a planter.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Without a planter, there is no plant.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Paul also said in 1 Corinthians 3 that he was a wise master builder who had laid a unique foundation which no one else was able to lay vv.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Apollos could water, but he could not lay the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He might do a lot of building work on this foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>One thousand Apolloses could do this, but the foundation was unique and was laid by a unique leader Paul as the wise master builder.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have seen that the Greek word for master builder is architeckton which really means architect.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>An architect is the one who gives the design and who superintends the building work.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He is the real leader.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Neither the contractor nor the foreman is the real leader.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The architect is the one who directs, and his word is the word that counts.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Bible likens God s move in this universe to a building.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God is the very builder, but he needs an architect.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The one who takes the leadership in God s move should be one who can give the design and do the superintending work to give the proper instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Regardless of how much humility Paul exercised in writing 1 Corinthians, he still stated the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He was a planter, and Apollos was not; and he was the unique wise architect who gave the design and who superintended the building work.</S>
