   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We are not saying that we do not need all the previous items.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Hallelujah, we have inherited all the foregoing matters!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the church life we have justification by faith, in the church life we have sanctification by faith, in the church life we also have the other items of the Lord's recovery, including the Pentecostal experience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What I mean is this: if we put our stress on any one of these things, we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If today we are only stressing and emphasizing the matter of justification by faith, we are four or five hundred years behind the time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we are so preoccupied with the age of the Pentecostal movement, we are at least three quarters of a century out of date.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Please do not misunderstand and think that we are opposing justification by faith or any other items of the Lord's past recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are not against the genuine speaking in tongues or the Pentecostal gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No, not at all.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are just for the church, the all-inclusive church, not the denominations, not the sects founded on particular items.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lutheran Church was founded on the doctrine of justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Holiness churches were founded on the doctrine of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The so-called Pentecostal churches were founded on the Pentecostal experience.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But the church is founded on none of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church is founded on the all-inclusive, unique unity of all believers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The age of the Lord's recovery today is the age of Christ as life, as the life-giving Spirit, and the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By experience we can say that there is no other way the local churches could be built up solidly and livingly but by Christ as life in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What we should be experiencing now day by day is the greater Jonah and the greater Solomon: the greater Jonah to be our resurrection life, and the greater Solomon to accomplish God's eternal purpose by building up His house and then His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hallelujah, today we have Christ as the greater Jonah and the greater Solomon!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this wonderful portion of Matthew, we have Christ as 1 today's David, 2 the greater Temple, 3 the Lord of the sabbath, 4 the greater Jonah, and 5 the greater Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you have Christ as all these items, you will have rest.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord Jesus said, "Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>My yoke is gentle, and my burden is light."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He said, in other words, "Just come to Me; I am your David who can afford you full satisfaction, I am the greater Temple in which you may be free from all kinds of bondage and regulations, I am the Lord of the sabbath who can give you rest and who is your rest, I am the greater Jonah that affords you something of the resurrection, and I am the greater Solomon, continually accomplishing God's economy in you, through you, and among you."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Where else could we find rest?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the only way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I know of some evangelists, missionaries, and Christian workers who work strenuously day by day in their evangelistic work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Yet while they are working, they do not have rest.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I am not criticizing, I am stating the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If they would honestly reveal their experience, they would admit that they are not at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then you may turn the question to me: "What about you, brother?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I can tell you by the Lord's grace that I work very much, but all the day I am resting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am so happy, so very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have the greater Jonah with the greater Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I have Christ as my resurrection life and I am in the accomplishment of God's eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hallelujah, there is nothing better than this!</S>
