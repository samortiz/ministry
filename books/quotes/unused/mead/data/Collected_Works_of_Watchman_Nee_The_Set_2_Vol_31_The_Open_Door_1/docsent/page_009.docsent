   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>News from Yen-Ping and Nan-Ya, Fukien Province</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Dear Sister X in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It took me only two and a half hours to travel by bus from Jien-Ou down to Yen-Ping on the fifth of this month.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Je-dun has come early to lead the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I helped a little with the women attendees.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Except for X, everyone was receptive.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I saw how they longed for the truth and how they honored people like us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nevertheless, I have told the Lord that I cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The only thing that I can do is to offer myself into the Lord's hand for His breaking so that others might be fed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I thank the Lord for showing me that the work is the Lord's. When it is effectual, one should not be thrilled; and when it is not effectual, one should not be disheartened.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One should just forge ahead according to the Lord's charge.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thank the Lord for leading me to live this sojourning life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>May the Lord truly make me a wanderer to sojourn in this land with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is a certain missionary in Yen-Ping whose life is quite excellent and who is also desirous of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>She has a heart for the Lord, but she has been deaf for the past four years.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I recall that Sister Hsiao Yu-yin was healed through a book written in English.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Perhaps Brother David Hsu borrowed that book from someone.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Please secure this book for me.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whether or not you can get the book, pray for this Western missionary sister.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>May the Lord be merciful to her and grant her grace to glorify His name.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the thirteenth of this month, I left Yen-Ping and took a one-and-a-half-hour bus ride north to Nan-Ya Village.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the first place on the upper course of the river where the X denomination began its work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Most of the members of the denomination are spiritually dead.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I have invited the women of the church to come together in the afternoon, and I have preached to them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hopefully, some will understand salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>May the Lord be gracious to us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After this, I will go to a village forty miles from here; from there I will return to Jien-Ou.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I have entrusted my children to the Lord and am at peace and undisturbed in serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thank the Lord, my son Jia-en was sick, but he was healed the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thank the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I have received recent news concerning many brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>May the Lord be gracious to you and may He empower you to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Peace be to you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Please greet Sister Chang for me.</S>

   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The region around Lung-Yen is at peace, and the work can still go on.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, I have felt quite lonely, and I am too weak to pioneer new regions.</S>
