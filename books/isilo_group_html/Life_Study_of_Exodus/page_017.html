WOMAN, LIVING AN INDEPENDENT LIFE,<br />BECOMING A REAL &ldquo;MALE&rdquo;</h2><p>If a woman lives an independent life, she becomes a real &ldquo;male.&rdquo; Today a great many women have become &ldquo;males.&rdquo; This is the main reason for the many separations and divorces.</p><h2 class="head1">IX. ONLY THE REAL &ldquo;FEMALE&rdquo; LIFE<br />BEING USEFUL TO GOD</h2><p>Whether we are sisters or brothers, we all need to be &ldquo;females&rdquo; and live by the only life that is useful to God. In order to be &ldquo;females&rdquo; we need to depend upon the Lord. The tree of life in Genesis 2 signifies dependence, and the tree of knowledge signifies independence. Life always makes us dependent, whereas knowledge always makes us independent. For example, before you teach a child something, he depends on you concerning that matter. But as soon as he learns that particular thing, he becomes proud and independent. Life, on the contrary, makes us dependent on God. God desires that we choose life instead of knowledge. This means that He wants us to choose dependence rather than independence.</p><p>To live an independent life means to live by the tree of knowledge, but to live a dependent life means to live by the tree of life. Living by the tree of life is actually living by the Lord Himself. The vine in John 15 is an excellent illustration of the dependent life. John 15:5 says, &ldquo;I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing.&rdquo; All the branches of the vine are dependent upon the vine. To abide in the vine is to be dependent upon the vine. Thus, as far as abiding is concerned, there can be no independence.</p><p>Not only do the worldly people live an independent life, but many Christians also live a life that is independent of God. For this reason, the vast majority of Christians have become useless to God. Therefore, we must learn that, whether we are males or females, we must live a life in constant dependence on God. No matter how long we have been with the Lord, we still must depend upon Him for life today. For example, we cannot graduate from eating, drinking, and breathing. How foolish for a person to say that because he has been breathing for seventy years he no longer needs to breathe! With life, there is no graduation. God&rsquo;s strategy is to put us in a position where we must depend upon Him. We need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, apart from You, I can do nothing. I must abide in You and take You as my life. Daily I need to eat the tree of life. Lord, I want to live a &#145;female&rsquo; life, a life that always depends on You.&rdquo; This is the kind of life God can use for the fulfillment of His purpose.</p><p>At the age of forty, Moses lived an independent &ldquo;male&rdquo; life. Acting independently of God, he exercised his natural strength to smite an Egyptian. Moses was truly an independent &ldquo;male.&rdquo; However, during the forty years Moses was set aside, God taught him that He would not use his male life. It is not an easy matter to train a male to live a female life. Nevertheless, in the second forty years of his life, Moses learned to be a female. During his third forty years, from the age of eighty to the age of one hundred twenty, Moses lived the life of a female. Only in one instance, when he struck the rock the second time, was he independent of God (Num. 20:7-13). Because Moses acted as a male on that occasion, he offended the Lord and thus was denied the privilege of entering into the good land.</p><p>Readers of the Bible usually regard Moses as the leader of the children of Israel. Moses, however, did not have this concept about himself; he never assumed a position as the leader. When the children of Israel rebelled against him, he considered it rebellion against God, not against himself. Moses simply went to the Lord and presented the problems to Him. In doing so, Moses honored the Lord as the head, as the unique male. This indicates that Moses was living a female life, a life of dependence on God.</p><p>The female life is seen not only in chapters one and two of Exodus, but also throughout the following chapters. We have pointed out that Moses was trained to live a female life. Moreover, all the warriors were living a female life of dependence on God. If you have not learned to be a female, you will not be able to fight for the kingdom of God. God uses only female warriors. This means that if you are living an independent male life, you are useless as far as spiritual warfare is concerned.</p><p>I wish to emphasize the point that to be a male is to be independent of God. For example, a husband may deal with his wife in a way that is independent of God, and a wife may deal with her husband in the same manner. This means that both the husband and wife may be &ldquo;males&rdquo; in the negative sense. But we should not be such &ldquo;males,&rdquo; those who are independent of God. We should be &ldquo;females,&rdquo; those who depend upon God and do nothing apart from Him. In all that we say or do we should depend on Him. If this is our situation, then we are true &ldquo;females&rdquo; living a dependent life.</p><p>The history of the church reveals that whenever there is such a &ldquo;female&rdquo; life, God is able to do something for His purpose. Take Martin Luther as an example. He was a man who learned to depend on God. No doubt, Luther was born with a strong will. Nevertheless, he learned to depend on the Lord. He did not live and act as a strong &ldquo;male,&rdquo; but as a dependent &ldquo;female.&rdquo;</p><p>The Apostle Paul also was such a &ldquo;female.&rdquo; His writings bear witness to this fact. As a &ldquo;female,&rdquo; Paul did not do anything in a way that was independent of the Lord. His work, his behavior, and his actions issued from a life of dependence on God.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Exodus &nbsp; pg 17</div><br></body></html>
