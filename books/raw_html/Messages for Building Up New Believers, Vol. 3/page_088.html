 <h2 class="head3">3. Not Denying the Lord&rsquo;s Name</h2>
<p>The Lord said, &ldquo;You...have not denied My name&rdquo; (v. 8). This is another characteristic of Philadelphia. In the long history of the church throughout the ages, the name of the Lord Jesus has always been last in importance. Men pay attention to names of saints, such as Peter and other apostles. They pay attention to names they like or to names of doctrines and nations. Many say proudly, &ldquo;I am a Lutheran,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am a Wesleyan.&rdquo; Oh, the names of men! Many claim proudly, &ldquo;I am a Coptic&rdquo; (of a place), or &ldquo;I am an Anglican&rdquo; (meaning British). These are names of countries. These names have divided God&rsquo;s children into divisions! It is as if the name of Christ were not enough to separate us from the world.</p>
<p>If someone asks you, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; and you answer, &ldquo;I am a Christian,&rdquo; he will not be satisfied. He will ask again, &ldquo;What kind of Christian are you?&rdquo; I remember once when I was in another country, a man asked me, &ldquo;What are you really?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I am a Christian.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;This is meaningless!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Lord&rsquo;s Name Being Enough</h2>
<p>To the Lord, His name is enough for His children. But we have to wait until Philadelphia before we see men who are satisfied with the Lord&rsquo;s name alone. There is no need to have so many divisive names. His name alone is enough! The Lord takes note that they &ldquo;have not denied My name.&rdquo; This is what He cares for.</p>
<p>There was never a time in church history when men loathed other names as much as they did in Philadelphia. When one returns to Philadelphia, all other names are denied! Philadelphia has abolished all other names and has exalted only the name of Christ. Please bear in mind that the Lord cares for this one thing. This one thing is the basis for His praise. This is something pleasing to Him. Do not belittle this and do not be careless about it. The Lord takes the time to point out that they have confessed His name and have not denied His name. He pays attention to this and praises it!</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Question of Overcoming</h2>
<p>Some brothers have asked, &ldquo;What have the overcomers in Philadelphia overcome?&rdquo; Do you see the problem posed by this question? The overcomers in Ephesus overcame forsaking their first love. The overcomers in Smyrna overcame the outward threat of death. The overcomers in Pergamos overcame the bondage and temptations of the world. The overcomers in Thyatira overcame the teaching of the woman. The overcomers in Sardis overcame spiritual death&mdash;the condition of being living in name and dead in reality. The overcomers of Laodicea overcame lukewarmness and vainglory. But what do the overcomers in Philadelphia overcome? The entire epistle to them shows only the Lord&rsquo;s pleasure in what they have done. Of the seven epistles, this is the only one which has the Lord&rsquo;s full approval. What is there to overcome if the Lord is fully pleased? It is a church fully approved and rated as the best; it is altogether according to the Lord&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire. But the Lord has a promise for the overcomers in the church in Philadelphia. What do they have to overcome? There is nothing to overcome because there is no problem with this church.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Holding Fast What You Have</h2>
<p>But the Lord has a warning here. Verse 11 says, &ldquo;I come quickly; hold fast what you have that no one take your crown.&rdquo; This is the only warning in the entire epistle. Those in Philadelphia are reminded to hold fast what they have. In other words, they have what is right, and they should not lose it. They should not be weary of doing the same things for a long time and should not ask for a change. They should not contemplate doing something new after all the years of doing the same things. They have to hold fast what they have and not let it go! This is the only warning for Philadelphia. The Lord has only one charge for Philadelphia&mdash;to hold fast what they have. What they have done is right and is blessed by the Lord; therefore, they should continue in it.</p>
<p>If Philadelphia does not hold fast what it has, God will raise up others to take away its crown. The crown has already been given to Philadelphia. But others will come and take its crown if it does not hold it fast. This is the only warning to Philadelphia. Philadelphia overcomes by not losing what it has. This is different from the other six churches. We must pay attention to the Lord&rsquo;s Word. There is only one church which meets the Lord&rsquo;s standard&mdash;Philadelphia. Her characteristic is keeping the Lord&rsquo;s word and not denying His name. We must not overlook these two matters.</p>
