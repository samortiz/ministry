<h1 class="title">THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 16:18; Eph. 4:11, 16; 2:20; 1 Pet. 2:5; 1 Cor. 3:9-10, 14; 14:4-5, 12, 26; Heb. 11:10</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S INTENTION BEING TO RECOVER<br />
THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning the building up of the church. Over the past two thousand years people have not paid sufficient attention to the matter of building. Over the last few centuries God has recovered many items. These items of recovery have occupied God&rsquo;s children so much that they have not had the energy to see God&rsquo;s further recovery. Strictly speaking, there has not been much recovery concerning the matter of building. Only in recent years has God led His people to consider this matter.</p>
<p>It has been difficult for us to find topics related to building up in Christian publications. Many people speak of edification, but few speak of building up. Therefore, in the English translations of the Bible, the Greek word for building up is often translated as &ldquo;edification&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;building up.&rdquo; This is also the case with the Chinese translation of the Bible. Many portions that are translated as &ldquo;edification&rdquo; should actually be &ldquo;building up.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SAINTS BEING BUILT UP AS A SPIRITUAL HOUSE</h2>
<p>In Greek the verb for <em>building up</em> has the same root as the noun <em>house.</em> If the word for <em>build up</em> is translated as &ldquo;edify,&rdquo; it conveys only the thought of education rather than the meaning of building. We need to see the difference between <em>building up</em> and <em>edification.</em> In the past we had a regard for edification but not for building up. We understood edification as a matter of individual experience and had no consciousness of its relation to corporate building up. However, in the Bible building refers not only to individuals being edified but also to the saints being built together. In other words, according to the Scriptures, building includes not only personal edification but also the saints being built up as a spiritual house (1 Pet. 2:5). Edification is needed for individual matters, and building up is needed for corporate matters.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BUILDING UP THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Since the words for <em>building up</em> and <em>house</em> have the same root in Greek, <em>building up</em> means to build all the saints up as a house. In spiritual terms it is to build them up as the Body (Eph. 2:20-22; 4:12). Our physical body can be compared to a house. Second Corinthians 5:1 refers to our body as a tabernacle, because our body is temporal. This verse also indicates that the transfigured body we will have in the future is a building from God, an eternal dwelling in the heavens.</p>
<p>The church is the house of God (Eph. 2:22) and the Body of Christ (4:12). Although the house of God and the Body of Christ indicate two aspects of the church, they refer to the same thing, because the Body of Christ is a spiritual house. First Corinthians 6:19 says that our body is a temple of the Holy Spirit. Our body is a temple, a building. When the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up&rdquo; (John 2:19), He was saying that if the Jews destroyed His body and killed Him, He would raise it up in three days. This shows that in the Bible, the body refers to a house, and the house refers to the temple. The church is the house of God and the Body of Christ; these are two aspects of one thing.</p>
<p>If the church is merely the Body, we may think that there is no need for building up; however, the Body is also a house. Hence, there is the need for building up. The Bible speaks of building a spiritual house (1 Pet. 2:5), the building of a dwelling place of God in spirit (Eph. 2:22), and also the building up of the Body of Christ (4:12). If we cannot apprehend the fact that the Body is a house, we will question the need for the Body to be built up.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> </body></html>
