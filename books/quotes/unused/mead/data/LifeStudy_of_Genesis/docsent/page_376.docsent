   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 Jacob's Maturity in Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Abraham also needed Jacob's maturity in life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the book of Genesis, the first person to bless others was Melchisedec 14:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As the book of Hebrews reveals, Melchisedec was a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But even when Abraham was very old, much older than Jacob lived to be, he never blessed anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although he received the blessing, he never passed on blessings to others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After Melchisedec, the next person to bless others was Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But Isaac blessed blindly; he was cheated and did not bless in a clear way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rather, he blessed the wrong person, giving the birthright to Jacob instead of to Esau ch.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>27 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, as the record at the end of Genesis reveals, Jacob, although he could not see well, blessed in a very clear way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After Jacob became mature, he blessed whomever he met.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Wherever he went, he did nothing except bless others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When Jacob was brought before Pharaoh, the first thing he did was bless him 47:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After talking a while with Pharaoh, Jacob blessed him again 47:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Jacob was not only a blessed person; he was also a blessing person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>While it is easy to receive a blessing, it is not easy to bless others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A grandson cannot bless his grandfather, because the grandson lacks the maturity in life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because Jacob was mature, he blessed everyone he met, including Pharaoh, who was an unbeliever, a Gentile king.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Jacob did not feel that he had to do anything for anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His burden was simply to bless others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Consider the case of Jacob's blessing the two sons of Joseph 48:8-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When Jacob laid his right hand upon Ephraim instead of upon Manasseh, the firstborn, Joseph was displeased and attempted to move his father's right hand to Manasseh's head, saying, "Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head" 48:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But Jacob refused and said, "I know it, my son, I know it" 48:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Jacob seemed to be saying, "I may be blind physically, but I am very clear spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You don't know what I am doing, but I know."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here we see that Jacob blessed Joseph's two sons with a clear, full, and rich blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Jacob also blessed his twelve sons in a very clear way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These blessings are the foundation of the basic prophecies in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we would know the prophecies in the Bible, we must go back to their foundation, to their basic elements, as seen in the blessings rendered by Jacob to his twelve sons.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Jacob could bless his sons in a way that was full of divine revelation because he was fully matured in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He was born a Jacob, but he was transformed into Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He was born a supplanter, a heel-holder, but he was transformed into a prince of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He had become so clear and full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we are clear and full of life, we can do nothing but bless.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is a sign of maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As we have seen, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob form one complete person in the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Abraham did not bless, because he did not have the maturity in life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Isaac, having some maturity but lacking the richness of the maturity of life, blessed in a blind way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Jacob, who was mature in life, blessed in a full and clear way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whatever he spoke was the divine word, and whatever he blessed was a prophecy concerning God's economy with all His children.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Eventually, Jacob became Israel, the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we have the light from the Scriptures as a whole, we shall see that the book of Genesis is a miniature of the complete revelation of the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At the end of Genesis we see a man called Israel, a transformed person who is transparent, clear, and full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The transformed Israel is a seed, a miniature, of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At the beginning of Genesis we have man created in God's image.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At the end of Genesis we have a transformed person, a man not only outwardly in the image of God, but a man in whom God has wrought Himself, making him His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although many Christians appreciate Abraham, his life was not high enough.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Israel's life was much higher.</S>
