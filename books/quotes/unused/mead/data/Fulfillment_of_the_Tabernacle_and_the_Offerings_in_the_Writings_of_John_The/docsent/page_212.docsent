   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Bearing the Cross without Rejection</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John 19:17 says, "And bearing the cross Himself, He went out to the place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the Lord Jesus was forced to bear the cross Himself, He did not reject it, even though He had not slept the previous night and had not eaten anything.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He did not protest, as we might have done, saying that He had done nothing wrong or complaining that He had to bear His own cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord behaved in such a way as to show His opposers and His disciples that He is the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In His behavior the Lord showed that as the One who is the resurrection, He could pass through the process of death without being afraid of anything.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Tolerating the Stripping Silently</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Those who were persecuting the Lord Jesus first took off His garments and then mockingly put a purple garment on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Later, they took off the purple garment and put His own garment on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eventually, when the Lord was crucified, He was stripped of His garments vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Silently He tolerated this stripping.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then after they nailed Him to the cross, the soldiers took His garments and made four parts, a part for each soldier v. 23 . But because the Lord is the resurrection and the life, He did not have any reaction to being stripped of His garments.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Caring for His Mother While Undergoing Crucifixion</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even while the Lord Jesus was suffering on the cross, He cared for His mother.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"Jesus, seeing His mother and the disciple whom He loved standing by, said to His mother, Woman, behold, your son.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then He said to the disciple, Behold, your mother.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We also see the Lord's care in the garden when He was arrested: "Jesus answered, I told you that I am; if therefore you are seeking Me, let these go away" 18:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even under the suffering of the betrayal of His false disciple and the arrest of the soldiers, the Lord still took good care of His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This reveals His easy manner in passing through the process of death.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The principle is the same with His caring for His mother while He was undergoing crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once again we see that the Lord was not afraid of death or weak in the presence of death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was bold, strong, and vigorous because He is the resurrection and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Taking the Vinegar Offered to Him in Mockery</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the Lord Jesus said, "I thirst," He was given vinegar to drink vv.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>28-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The vinegar was offered to Him in mockery.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Nevertheless, the Lord took the vinegar that was offered to Him in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every aspect of the Lord's behavior in this chapter indicates that He was strong, bold, and not afraid of death.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He passed through death and overcame it, manifesting the fact that He is the resurrection and the life.</S>
