   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Forgiveness to Restore Fellowship</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First John 2:1 and 2 say, "My little children, these things I write to you that you may not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous; and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for those of the whole world."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First John 1:9 says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must be clear about the special emphasis of the Gospel of John and 1 John.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Gospel of John shows the gospel among men; whereas 1 John shows the gospel in the heart of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Gospel of John has two lines: grace and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When grace is mentioned, truth is also mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First John also has two lines: God is love, and God is light.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the one hand, it speaks of love, and on the other hand, it speaks of light.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What is the relationship between grace and truth, and love and light?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Love is in God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When it is expressed among men, it is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Light is in God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When it is expressed among men, it is truth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Gospel of John brings God to man, while 1 John brings man to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Gospel of John speaks of the matters of life, salvation, eternal life, and so forth; whereas 1 John speaks of fellowship, drawing near to God, and going to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Gospel of John deals with the matter of salvation; whereas 1 John deals with the matter of fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The beginning of 1 John speaks of the matter of fellowship, and chapters one and two speak on the forgiveness in this fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are two kinds of relationships between God and us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One is a kindred relationship in that we are saved and are children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This relationship can never be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Let me ask: is a son no longer a son of his father because of his misbehavior?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No. If a son does not want to be his father's son, can he stop being his father's son? No. If a father denies his son, is the son no longer a child of his? No. If you are a certain man's son, can someone else or even Satan annul this fact? No. We can respectfully say that even God cannot deny this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, after a person is regenerated and becomes a child of God, no one is able to overthrow this relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This relationship can never be severed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Nevertheless, there is another type of relationship which is subject to interruption.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the relationship of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, although you are your father's son, if you do something wrong one day, you will be afraid to see your father for fear of his rebuke.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The more serious the mistake, the more you will be afraid to see him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Though your family relationship can never be cut off, your communication with your father may be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our relationship with God is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After we are saved, there is still the possibility that we will commit sins.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whenever we sin, our fellowship with God is immediately cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In order for the fellowship with God to be restored, our sins must be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we commit sins we must, according to 1 John 1:9, "confess our sins."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must say, "O God, I was wrong in this matter; please forgive me."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After confessing this way, our fellowship with God can be restored.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By what means are we cleansed from our sins?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are cleansed by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many Christians try to use time to wash their sins away, instead of applying the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How do they do this?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some may commit a sin and stay in their bad feelings for several days, thinking that God could not forgive them so quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After five or ten days, when their heart is at peace, they think that the sin is no more.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They try to wash their sins away by using five or ten days instead of applying the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must remember that forgiveness of sins comes by the blood, not by forgetting.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are not forgiven because we have forgotten our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Rather, the blood of His Son Jesus washes away all our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God can only forgive our sins under the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Someone once asked a child what a person should do if he has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The child answered, "He should do two things.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>First, he should feel sorrowful for several days, and second, he should be forgiven."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The theology of this child is the theology of many people.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is also the thought of many older people.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It seems that only if we suffer enough will we be forgiven; otherwise, we cannot be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Brothers and sisters, even if one suffers many days, he still cannot earn one percent of forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>While we should have a sorrowful and penitent heart for our sins, our forgiveness does not depend upon our sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Rather, it depends upon the blood of Jesus who saved us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we confess our sins, God will forgive us through the blood of the Lord, and the fellowship between God and us will be restored.</S>
