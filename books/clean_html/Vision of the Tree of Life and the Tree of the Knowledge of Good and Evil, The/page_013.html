<h1 class="title">THE TWO TREES BEING TWO LINES<br />
THAT RUN THROUGHOUT THE BIBLE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONSISTENT THOUGHT IN THE BIBLE<br />
BEING GOD AS MAN&rsquo;S LIFE</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the vision in Genesis 2. Even though the Bible contains sixty-six books, it is consistent from the beginning to the end. Most people do not have this thought when they read the Bible, nor can they accurately identify the line of thought that runs throughout the Bible. Some theologians say that the Bible speaks of Christ; therefore, Christ is the subject that holds the Bible together. It is correct to say this, and we often say this.</p>
<p>However, the first two chapters and the last two chapters of the Bible are focused on life. In the beginning of the Bible, after God created man, He placed man before the tree of life for man to notice, contact, and receive the tree of life (Gen. 2:8-9). At the end of the Bible the tree of life is growing among the people gained by God throughout the generations (Rev. 22:2). No one can deny that the most crucial portion of the Bible concerns Christ&rsquo;s appearing. This is the incarnation of God to live on the earth (John 1:14, 18). What is the purpose of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; coming to the earth? He said, &ldquo;I have come that they may have life&rdquo; (10:10). The Holy Spirit also testified on His behalf, saying, &ldquo;In Him was life&rdquo; (1:4). In a more personal way the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever&rdquo; (6:51). Then the Holy Spirit points out that &ldquo;these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing, you may have life in His name&rdquo; (20:31). Later, when the apostles went out to preach the gospel, an angel confirmed that they were speaking &ldquo;the words of this life&rdquo; (Acts 5:20). When writing the Epistles, Paul said, &ldquo;Christ our life&rdquo; (Col. 3:4); Peter said, &ldquo;His divine power has granted to us all things which relate to life and godliness&rdquo; (2 Pet. 1:3); John said, &ldquo;We...report to you the eternal life&rdquo; (1 John 1:2), and &ldquo;He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life&rdquo; (5:12). These verses show that God&rsquo;s desire to be man&rsquo;s life is a consistent thought in the Bible. In other words, God desires to be mingled with man to become man&rsquo;s content and to be expressed through man. This thought is consistent in the Bible.</p>
<p>Genesis 1:26 says that God created man in His image and according to His likeness. Suppose a brother wants a jacket made for him. The jacket must be made according to his measurements, because it is for him to wear. Likewise, God created man in His image and according to His likeness because man is a vessel that He wants to &ldquo;put on.&rdquo; God wants to put man on for His expression. Therefore, the Bible begins with God&rsquo;s desire to be contained in man so that He would be expressed by man. At the end of Revelation the redeemed people have the tree of life as their content, and God&rsquo;s glory and light are their expression (22:2; 21:23). God&rsquo;s glory and light are God expressed. Chapter 4 says that the God who is sitting on the throne has the appearance of jasper (v. 3). Then chapter 21 says that the wall of the New Jerusalem is jasper (v. 18). This means that in the future all God&rsquo;s redeemed people will express the image of God outwardly, and their content will be God as their life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD COMING IN THE FORM OF FOOD<br />
TO BE MAN&rsquo;S LIFE</h2>
<p>To a great extent, the Bible was written according to man&rsquo;s ability to comprehend. In order to enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life, God must be digested by man and mingled with man. God also wants to be man&rsquo;s strength and supply. The best way to express this desire is to say that God wants to be man&rsquo;s food. There is no other example that can appropriately convey God&rsquo;s desire to enter into man and be digested by man in order to become man&rsquo;s element, life supply, and strength by which man can live. Therefore, from its beginning to its end, the Bible consistently shows that God came as food so that He may enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life. In other words, He wants to be assimilated by man in order to become man&rsquo;s element, supply, and nutrition so that man may live because of Him.</p>
<p>Objectively, the Bible bears the testimony of Christ (John 5:39); subjectively, however, the Bible was written to show us how God in Christ becomes our life (1 John 5:12; Col. 3:4). God wants to be our life, so He came as food for us to eat and digest so that He can become our element and our nutrition. This is how He supplies us to live because of Him (John 6:51, 57). God also wants to live out from within us, that is, to be expressed through us (Gal. 2:20; Phil. 1:20-21). This divine thought runs from the beginning to the end of the Bible. If we want a thorough understanding in our reading of the Bible, we must grasp this point; otherwise, our reading of the Bible will not be thorough.</p>
