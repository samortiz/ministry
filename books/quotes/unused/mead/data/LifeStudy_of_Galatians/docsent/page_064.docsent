   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BECOMING AS PAUL WAS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 12 says, Become as I am, because I also am as you, brothers, I beseech you.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You did not injure me at all.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul was free from the bondage of Jewish observances.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He besought the Galatians to become as he was, even as he had become as a Gentile for the truth of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Having done his best to become the same as the Galatians, he now besought them to become as he is.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He seemed to be saying, I love you and became like you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now I ask you to become as I am.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I am not for days, months, seasons, and years.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I am for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I beg you, become as I am.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In verse 12 Paul tells the Galatians that they did not injure him at all.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Galatians had not injured Paul in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Paul expects that neither would they injure him now.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>AN OPPORTUNITY TO MINISTER CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 13 continues, And you know that on account of weakness of the flesh I preached the gospel to you formerly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In his first journey, Paul was detained in Galatia because of physical weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>While there, he preached the gospel to the Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His illness afforded him a good opportunity to minister Christ to them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 14 says, And that which was a trial to you in my flesh you did not despise nor loathe, but you received me as a messenger of God, as Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here Paul appeals to their love by reminding them that they had received him as a messenger of God, an angel, and had not despised his sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THEIR BLESSEDNESS</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In verse 15 Paul goes on to say, Where then is your blessedness?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For I testify to you that if possible you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Greek words rendered your blessedness also mean your felicitation, your happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Galatians formerly considered Paul s being retained in their place and preaching the gospel to them a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They were happy about it and boasted of it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That became their felicitation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, now that they had departed from Paul s preaching of the gospel, the apostle questions them, Where then is your blessedness, your happiness, your felicitation?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When Paul was among them, the Galatians celebrated their happiness with one another and congratulated one another for the opportunity to have such a minister of Christ with them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When Paul was in Galatia preaching the gospel, ministering Christ to the people, they were happy and regarded Paul s presence as a great blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This happiness, blessedness, felicitation, is what is implied by the Greek term used here.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Galatians appreciated Paul s preaching and loved him to such an extent that, as he says, if possible, they would have torn out their eyes and given them to him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This may indicate that Paul s physical weakness v. 13 was in his eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This may be confirmed by the large letters he used in writing to them 6:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It may also be the thorn in his flesh, some physical weakness, which he prayed might be removed from him 2 Cor 12:7-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>AN APPEAL TO THE BELIEVERS AFFECTION</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In verse 16 Paul asks, So have I become your enemy in speaking the truth to you?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This word indicates that certain of the deceived ones had come to regard Paul as an enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Suppose some brothers visit the saints in a certain region, and the saints there receive them gladly.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, later the saints are distracted by some teaching or practice and turn against the very brothers whom they once gladly received and appreciated highly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In such a case, these brothers may be tempted to give up on the saints in that region.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But this definitely was not Paul s attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the contrary, he was burdened to write them and to appeal to them in a loving manner.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should learn of Paul to take up the burden for those believers who have turned away from us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Perhaps we should write them and say, Do you not remember how you served us in love?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Where is your love today?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It seems that now you consider us your enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To be sure, this is not reasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Are we enemies simply because we speak the truth to you?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In writing Galatians 3, Paul spoke like an attorney.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But in composing chapter four, he wrote like a loving father.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Chapter four was written according to Paul s personal and intimate love for the Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Instead of arguing in a legal way like a lawyer, Paul appealed to the believers affection.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we would be those who minister Christ to others, we must learn to speak to them in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should not simply speak according to doctrinal truth, but should appeal to others in a personal, loving manner.</S>
