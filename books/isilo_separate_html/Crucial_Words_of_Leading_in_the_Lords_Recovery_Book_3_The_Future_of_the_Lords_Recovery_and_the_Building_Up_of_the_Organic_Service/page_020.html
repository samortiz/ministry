<p>In 1920 the Lord raised us up in China. We did not do something on our own in order to have a unique style. Instead, we studied church history and compared everything with the Bible. In 1922 Brother Nee began the first meeting in Foochow, which is in southern China. That was more than sixty years ago. The meetings in northern China began in Chefoo in 1932. The responsibility for the meetings in northern China fell mainly on me. I have been in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery from 1932 until today, 1984. That is a total of fifty-two years.</p>
<p>Since 1827 when the Lord raised up the British Brethren, the light of the truth has been pouring out. There were several famous Bible teachers among the Brethren. The most famous Bible teacher was J. N. Darby. The Brethren published many books that have helped countless Christians over the past one hundred years. Spurgeon once praised a teacher from the Brethren named William Kelly and said that Kelly&rsquo;s mind was as great as the ocean. C. H. Mackintosh wrote <em>Notes on the Pentateuch.</em> D. L. Moody once pointed to his personal collection of books and said, &ldquo;You can burn all the books on these shelves except for the Bible and Mackintosh&rsquo;s <em>Notes on the Pentateuch.</em>&rdquo; This proves that the truth that the Brethren received had a great influence on others.</p>
<p>During the last half century, Christianity in America has been influenced mainly by the Scofield Reference Bible. The top American theological seminaries, such as Dallas Theological Seminary and Moody Bible Institute, base their teachings on the Scofield Reference Bible. More than ninety percent of the notes in the Scofield Reference Bible are based on the Brethren teachings. Even though these theological seminaries did not take the way of the Brethren, they fully accepted the teachings of the Brethren.</p>
<p>In 1920 the Lord raised us up in China; that was after the first war in Europe which ended in 1918. At that time many spiritual books were put out in Europe. Not only were the Brethren publishing spiritual books; other believers were also putting out books. The books of Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis were quite influential. There were also books by C. H. Spurgeon. Most of his books were published in England and were highly valued. In America books by A. B. Simpson were published. We have included many of his hymns in our hymnal. A. B. Simpson founded the Christian and Missionary Alliance. Simpson was spiritual, and his messages that contain the basic revelation concerning Christ as our life are well-known.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRISTIANITY NOT MAKING PROGRESS<br />
FOR MANY YEARS</h2>
<p>It has been thirty-nine years since the end of the Second World War in 1945. Based on my knowledge and observation, it is hard to find a weighty spiritual book that was published during this period. Some people might say that I am too much and that Christianity puts out many books and magazines. However, not one of these publications is spiritually weighty in scriptural exposition, in the light of the truth, or in the supply of life.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is the center of Christian publications in Chinese, and for the past several years no publications of spiritual weight have been put out from there. The number of weighty spiritual publications that were put out between 1820 and 1930 cannot be counted. However, very few spiritual publications of weight have been put out over the past thirty-nine years. Many publications have been put out, but not one of them has spiritual weight and value.</p>
<p>For the more than twenty years that I have been living in America, I have been observing the books put out in Christianity; some of the brothers have been helping me. It is difficult to find a book or a message that contains the light of truth or the supply of life. However, a group of scholars have done an excellent work over the past ten years and put out several lexicons for the Greek New Testament. These books have helped us tremendously.</p>
<p>I began to use the Greek New Testament in the winter of 1932, and I have continued using it for the past fifty-two years. Even though I do not understand Greek literature, I can be considered an expert on the usage of Greek words. All the Greek lexicons published in the past cannot compare to the quality of the Greek lexicons that were published during the past ten years in America. However, with respect to light, truth, life, and scriptural exposition, the situation in America is just as poor as everywhere else. Christian publishers in America have no way other than to reprint old books. This is the situation in all of Christianity today. This is the progression of the history of Christianity from after the apostles until the present.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> </body></html>
