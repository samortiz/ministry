   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>After a believer accepts the misunderstanding concerning dying with Christ and allows himself to fall into passivity 1 he will no longer be active, 2 God will no longer use him either, because this would go against the principle of His working; and 3 evil spirits will seize the opportunity to attach themselves to him because this situation fits the condition for evil spirits to work.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Therefore, the consequence of this misconception about dying with Christ and trying to practice it is nothing other than demon-possession and a pretense of being filled by God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen believers in many places become possessed by demons and have many peculiar experiences after they misapprehended the teaching of Galatians 2.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After the believer "dies" in this way, evil spirits cause him to have no feeling and make him ignorant of the need for any feelings of his own.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When he contacts others, they feel that he is like a sculpture of iron or stone; he seems to have no sensing organs at all.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He does not realize the sufferings of others, and he does not realize how he has caused others to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He has no ability to know, differentiate, sense, or examine everything that is outside of him or within him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is not at all conscious of his attitude, appearance, or actions.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He does not exercise his will to think, deduce, or determine before he speaks and acts.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He does not know where his words, thoughts, and feelings come from.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His own will never takes any action, yet many words, thoughts, and feelings express themselves through him by taking hold of him as though he were a flowing channel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All his actions and conduct are mechanical.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He does not know the reason for these things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is bewildered and acts only because he receives commands and pressure from some unknown source.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even though he has no "self-consciousness," when others mistreat him slightly, he is very prone to misunderstand and feel hurt.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He passes his days in a state of numbness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He supposes that he has died with Christ and does not sense even himself anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Little does he know that "the lack of consciousness" is both the condition as well as the consequence of evil spirits possessing him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This enables evil spirits to cling to him, hinder him, attack him, impress him, make suggestions to him, think for him, support him, and urge him on without any restraint whatsoever because he is void of any feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, we must remember that what we commonly know as "dying to self" is the dying to the life, power, opinion, and activity of the self outside of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not the death of one's person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We do not exterminate ourselves to render our person non-existent.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This must be made very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we say that we do not have the self, it means that we do not have the activity of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are not saying that there will not be the existence of our person!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a believer thinks that he should annihilate the existence of his person, that he should not think, feel, or have an opinion, or that he should not have any movement of the body, but instead that he should live his life in a dream, both day and night, without any knowledge of where he is, he will be possessed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He may think that this is a true death to the self, that he is indeed a person void of the self, and that his spiritual experience is higher than that of anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Yet his consecration is not a consecration to God, but a consecration to evil spirits.</S>
