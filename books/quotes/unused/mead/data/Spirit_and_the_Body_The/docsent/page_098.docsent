   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINETEEN THE SITE OF GOD'S BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we come to the matter of the site of God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Everyone in the Lord's recovery needs to be very clear about this.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first thing the builder of a house must take care of is the site on which he will build.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If he builds the house on the wrong site, that house will belong to the one who owns the lot.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, the site, or the ground, is crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If the ground is wrong, there will be a problem, even though the house may be built perfectly.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, we all must know what is the site of God's building in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>SURROUNDED BY DIVISIONS</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today we are surrounded by divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the past, many of us have traveled from site to site, from division to division.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the early years of my Christian life, I traveled to three sites or grounds.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I know some who have visited a number of sites during the period of a year.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First they were with the Episcopalians, then with the Lutherans, and after that with the Methodists.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After staying with the Methodists a short time, they visited the Assembly of God and remained there for a while.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Following this, they contacted a number of independent groups.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Perhaps this is the history of your Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Are you still traveling in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Traveling is the positive word; wandering is the negative one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The reason you were traveling, or wandering, so much in the past was that you did not know what the proper ground was.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You were trying to live the Christian life, but you did not know where to live it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE IMPORTANCE OF THE GROUND</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 1960 I gave a series of messages in New York on the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After one of the meetings, the leading ones expressed their appreciation and told me that I had rendered them a great help.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Seizing the opportunity to strengthen them and to further impress them, I said, "Brothers, you have visited a certain spiritual place where people constantly talk about the Body and about the principle of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You were told that we Christians should not be individualistic, but should be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, those in that place did not tell you where to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They talked about the building, yet said not a word concerning the site, the ground, of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Tonight we in New York are all happy with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But perhaps after a few months some of you will no longer be happy with the rest of us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because you are unhappy, you may look for some place where you can be happy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You may go there, stay for a while, and then look for still another place.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you do this, you will repeat your history."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No matter how spiritual we are, we cannot be built up with others if we are not on the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Before we can be built up, we need to be certain concerning the site on which we intend to build.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For example, before building a meeting hall, you need to have the proper site.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is impossible to build a hall without a site, for a hall cannot be suspended in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many Christians today talk about the church and the Body, yet they have not seen the proper ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because they lack the proper ground, the result is that they build up something one day and tear it down the next.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Actually, they have not built up anything, because they do not have the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The only thing that can keep us steady is the unique ground.</S>
