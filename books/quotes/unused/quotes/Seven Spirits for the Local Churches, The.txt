These messages were taken from the book of Revelation concerning the seven Spirits of God for the local churches
In Matthew the Spirit is the third person of the Godhead, but in Revelation the third person becomes the second
Matthew tells us that God was incarnated so that we might be baptized into the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
Peter, John, and Matthew only needed the onefold Spirit, but today we need the sevenfold Spirit because we are so dead
They were supposed to be so much for God, but eventually, they put the incarnated God, the Lord Jesus, to death
O brothers and sisters, the Lord be merciful to us that we do not remain the same as the Jews when Christ came
Today the Spirit of God is the sevenfold Spirit, and this title of the Spirit is used four times in the book of Revelation
It is not just a matter of the word spoken by the Lord or the word written in the Bible, but the speaking of the sevenfold Spirit
If He is speaking to the local churches, yet you are outside the local churches, you will completely miss this book
The sevenfold Spirit is not for any individual or for the so-called universal church but for the local churches on this earth
It was in such a situation that the Lord wrote this book to the seven local churches, using the title of the sevenfold Spirit
We must keep in mind that this burning, sevenfold Spirit is not for any individual or for the so-called universal church
If we are not in the local churches, we lose our position, and if we miss the position, how can we understand?
At the end of each epistle, the Lord Jesus tells us that we must hear what the Spirit says to all the churches
That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit'
Whether we are wrong or not is questionable, but one thing is sure: those who argue about right and wrong are really dead
It is not a matter of how to do this or how to do that; it is a matter of listening to and following the sevenfold Spirit
It is only when we turn from our mind to the Spirit that we will see that the sevenfold intensified Spirit is for the local churches
There are the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven bowls mentioned in this book, but these are not in the beginning or at the end
There are the local churches, and then eventually, there is the ultimate consummation of the churches, which is the New Jerusalem
We must have a thorough look into the local churches, for as we have seen, this book is a book of the seven Spirits for the local churches
There are many subjects, many doctrines, and many things covered in this book, but the main figures are only four
In a painting of a tiger, there may be many things in the background, but the main figure in the painting is the tiger
In the background there may be mountains, woods, and many other items, but it is principally a portrait of a tiger
It is a divine painting, a spiritual painting, an eternal and heavenly painting with thousands and even millions of things in the background
As we come through all the Epistles to the last book of Revelation, we see that this book is mainly about the churches
They speak mostly about the 'mountains,' the 'trees,' the 'grass,' and so many other things, but they have forgotten about the 'tiger'
If we were to ask the wives, they would tell us that the Bible says in Ephesians 5 that the husbands must love their wives
If we were to ask the husbands what the Bible speaks about, they would say that it says the wives must submit to their husbands
All human beings know about God, but only a small number know both God and Christ, because Christ is a real mystery
If we have sixty-six books in our Bible, we not only have God, Christ, and the church, but we also have the local churches
In Acts and the Epistles we have the church and the churches, and in Revelation we have the churches, which are emphasized as being local
To know the churches, the local churches, is the greatest improvement in knowing the four main figures revealed in the Bible
In the last age of God's dispensation, and in the last book of His Scripture, the main thing is the local churches
The book of Revelation was written to the local churches, so only in the local churches are we in the position to inherit this book
Not long after the New Testament was completed, the church began to lose all the important things found in the Bible
Later, in 1937, Brother Nee gave us another series of messages, which was clear and adequate regarding the practicality of the church life
The English translation was originally entitled Concerning Our Missions but is now called The Normal Christian Church Life
After the war, from 1948 until his imprisonment in 1952, Brother Nee gave many messages on the practicality of the church life
We have chosen some of these messages and put them together in the book Further Talks on the Church Life by Watchman Nee
Those who are so much for the universal church say that the invisible church is the real one and all the visible churches are the false ones
They tell you that something is wonderful, but if you ask them where it is, they can only say that it is invisible
Some Christian teachers say that in this evil age it is an impossibility to have a real church; we must wait until that day
It is like someone telling us to see a football game tomorrow morning, but when we get there, the game is over
The first group began to criticize the second group: they said that the spirituality was not according to the doctrine
On her forehead there was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH'
In the first vision the apostle John saw the seven golden lampstands, and these golden lampstands are the seven local churches
In the second vision John saw a throne, and the One who sat on the throne had a sealed scroll in His right hand
Out of this scroll there were seven seals and out of the seven seals were seven trumpets and included in the seven trumpets were seven bowls

In the seven parables of that chapter, there is a parable spoken by the Lord of a woman who put some leaven into fine flour
Christ is the fine flour given to us by God as our food, but here is a woman putting some leaven into the flour
If we are clear about this, we will have nothing to do with Christmas and its Santa Claus, Christmas stockings, and Christmas tree
We know where the Roman Catholic Church is, and we know where the denominations are, but where are the free groups?
If we are honest before the Lord and faithful to His Word, we must look at this picture to consider where we must be
That is the proper realm, the proper place, the proper standing, and the proper position for the children of God to realize the real oneness
We know there are at least thirteen million Hebrew people now on the earth-in New York alone, there are about three million
Suppose some of the Hebrews in New York are unhappy with this and say, 'Why do you call yourselves the nation of Israel?
There are others who say that we should not say we are the church in a certain place because we are so small a number
Suppose the Smith family has twenty-two members, yet due to certain reasons, they gradually leave until only one remains
Now only a small number of us in Los Angeles realize that we must be in the local church and that we should not join any denomination
Some say that since we cannot represent the entire Smith family, we had better call ourselves the Smith Center
As long as we have two or three coming together in the name of the Lord, Matthew 18:20 tells us that the Lord is in our midst
The local churches are in the first three chapters of Revelation, and the New Jerusalem is in the last two chapters

In the first of the seven epistles in this book, the promise is the promise of eating, and in the last one the promise is also of eating
Even at the end of the first century, history tells us that there were many different kinds of teachings in the church
The mysterious Babylon is a mixture of the church with the world; it is less of the church and more of the world
There is no doctrinal teaching in the book of Revelation, no justification by faith, no sanctification, and no redemption
It emphatically tells us about the local churches and that the consummation of these local churches will be the New Jerusalem
These seven churches are not the seven churches on the streets, on the campuses, in the homes, or in the factories
He had to repeat all the names of the cities with so many tos and so many conjunctions so that we might see the local churches
If we are willing to see the local churches, the whole book of Revelation will open to us because our position will be proper
We must be in the local churches, and the Lord's intention in the local churches is simply for us to eat and drink
The Lord told John to write to the church in Ephesus that he who overcomes will be given the tree of life to eat in the local churches
As we have seen, in the New Jerusalem there is a river of water of life flowing out of the throne of the redeeming God
Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne'
It is so clear that there are two things that come from the throne of God: one is the burning fire, and the other is the flowing water
Our opinions must be burned, our different concepts must be burned, and our doctrines and knowledge must all be burned
The more we say, 'Amen,' the more we will be burned, and the more we say, 'Hallelujah,' the more we will be burned
If we really mean business with the Lord when we say, 'O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah,' there will be something flowing within
Hebrews 416 says Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help
We will never know how much these four words have helped the brothers and sisters, not only in the United States but also in the Far East
It is because when we say these four words, we are touching the seven Spirits of God which are before the throne
The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God, who sits upon the throne, saying, Amen, Hallelujah!
A voice came out from the throne, saying, Praise our God, all His slaves and those who fear Him, the small and the great
Sometimes the seven Spirits will lead us to be silent, and at other times the seven Spirits will lead us to shout
If we come to the throne of God and say, 'O Lord, O Lord, O Lord,' the seven Spirits of God will burn and flow within us
Let us all open ourselves to the Spirit to be really burned and watered so that the Lord may have a free way among us in the local churches
He had in His right hand seven stars and out of His mouth proceeded a sharp twoedged sword and His face shone as the sun shines in its power
We may have been Christians for years but did not realize that Christ today is the glorious man walking in the midst of the local churches
If we would have Christ walking in the United States, we must have a good number of local churches in this country
He is walking in our midst not as a general in the army, or as a king, but as the High Priest in a perfect robe
We read that the Christ in Revelation has eyes like a flame of fire and feet like shining bronze, as having been fired in a furnace
Suppose Christ were here today with His seven burning eyes and His feet like shining bronze, as having been fired in a furnace
We need to be noisy, because the very Christ who is within us and who is walking in our midst is a Christ with a loud voice
If you would forget your mind and contact the living Christ who is walking in the midst of the local churches, you will be burning
He has seven burning eyes His feet are like shining bronze as having been fired in a furnace and His voice is like the sound of many waters
These epistles were written to churches in a state of degradation, and the churches today are, no doubt, also in degradation
In the first epistle, the one to Ephesus, the Lord requires in His recovery of the local churches the first love
The Lord tells this church that they have the works, the labor, and many good things, but they have left the first love
The more we love the Lord Jesus, the more we will be shining, and the more we will enjoy Him as the tree of life
To be the lampstand and to enjoy the Lord as the tree of life requires the best love toward the Lord a love which surpasses all other things
Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison that you may be tried, and you will have tribulation for ten days
The persecution to the lovers of Jesus is not from the heathen world but from the religious people of a synagogue system
If we only love Jesus and do not care for anything religious, we will surely be persecuted by the synagogue of Satan
Of course, we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus, but there is no need to put such a term at the end of our prayers in a formal way
The local churches must suffer persecution, because they can never go along with anything of the system of religion
In past years on the mainland of China, many so-called gifted Christian brothers came to contact Brother Watchman Nee
If we trace the history of today's Christianity, we will see why so much spiritual fornication and so many idols have been brought in

We went, and, praise the Lord, we received some letters in Taiwan saying that the meetings in Los Angeles were even more living
If we only have a moral mentality to know what is right and what is wrong, this proves that we do not have the sense of life
Sometimes when we come to the meeting, we are so filled with the joy of the Lord that we have to shout, 'Hallelujah, Hallelujah'!
Simply due to the religious custom we received from our background, we will not shout because we think we should not
If we invite friends to come, it is unnecessary to preach to them; we simply let them see the love that we have with oneness and harmony

The record of God's creation in Genesis 1-2, strictly speaking, is not a record of creation but a record of life
Only one verse is the record of creation, and that is the first verse of chapter 1: 'In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth'
According to the Hebrew text, Genesis 1:2 must be rendered in this way: 'But the earth became waste and emptiness'
The fish in the waters, the birds in the air, and the beasts of the field-all of these animal lives-were produced
Genesis 2 continues by showing how God made man from the dust of the ground and placed him before the tree of life
Man was made with the highest life among the created lives, but man still needs the divine life, the eternal life, the uncreated life
The body is for contacting the physical world, the soul is our being, and the spirit is the part whereby we may contact God
By the tree of life, a river was flowing, and in the flow of the river, precious materials were produced: gold, bdellium , and onyx
The first two chapters of the Bible are a record showing how life produces the materials to build up the bride
In this last book we have all these terms: tree of life, crown of life, book of life, water of life, and waters of life
The tree of life is for us to eat, the water of life is for us to drink, and the crown of life is for us to wear
We must take something into us as life, we must put something upon us as life, and we must be recorded in the book of life
Out of the redeeming God, the Lamb-God, proceeds the river of life, and on either side of the river grows the tree of life

They could tell you why they had to put their shoes in a certain direction by referring to a verse in the Old Testament
Is the proof: The magi were told by the people who had the Bible that Christ was to be born in Bethlehem, and they went to Bethlehem
The Bible tells us He was to be born in Bethlehem, but it does not say on what street, in what house, and at what address

In Revelation 5:8-14 there are the praises in the beginning of the book; then in 19:1-7 there are the praises again at the end

They build up their cathedrals and church buildings with stained-glass windows and make their places of so-called worship so dark
Verse 1 says something about being spiritual, and verse 2 says that when the Corinthians were Gentiles, they were led away to dumb idols

Regardless of how much you simply listen and hear, there is nearly nothing satisfying and refreshing; there is nearly nothing nourishing
Romans 5:10 says that we will be saved in the Lord's life, and Romans 10:13 says that whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved
Whenever these dear ones are doing their best in this way, we must say from deep within, 'O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!
The Bible tells us in 2 Chronicles 20:22 that when the people began to praise the Lord, the Lord set ambushes for the enemy
Balak was troubled because he thought the people of Israel were full of sin, yet Balaam said that God did not behold any sin among them
By that time nearly all the local churches were degraded and poor, and he was in exile on the island of Patmos
One day, sooner or later, there will be a great voice in the heavens saying that Babylon is fallen, and the Lamb's wife is ready
Revelation 5:4-5 tells us that the apostle John wept: 'I wept much because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or look into it
It was because in the whole universeheaven earth under the earth and in the seathere was no one worthy to open the secret of Gods economy
Some victories have been won in the past, some victories are being won at the present, and some victories will be won in the future

Besides all the other aspects we have seen in the previous chapters, there are also these five aspects in chapters 7, 8, 10, 14, and 18
In the book of Revelation, He is not a small Christ, a gentle Christ, a kind Christ, a patient Christ, or a suffering Christ
We need to know this different Christ, this other Angel: Oh, the seven Spirits; oh, the local churches; and oh, the different Christ!
If we are in the seven Spirits, if we are in the local churches, and if we experience the different Christ, we will be so much in life
We will participate in all the victories by means of the seven Spirits, the local churches, the different Christ, life, and praising
We say 'Amen' to the sevenfold Spirit, 'Amen' to the local churches, and 'Amen' to the Christ so bold, so fierce, so burning, and so living
It is simply by realizing the sevenfold Spirit, being in the local churches, and realizing that Christ is your life
