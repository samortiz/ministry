   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRIESTHOOD HAVING THE IMAGE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The priesthood in reality needs God s image, which requires transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We are all priests and kings in position, but we fall short of God s image in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have not been transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even in the Old Testament dispensation Moses was a priest, not only by birth, but also in reality, because he was in the image of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Second Corinthians 3 also makes reference to Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was open to the Lord and remained in His presence for forty days without a single veil or covering.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was so permeated and saturated with the Lord that the shekinah glory of the image of God was on his face.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only a priest could have such an image, because only a priest can enter into the Holy of Holies and stay in the shekinah glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must be transformed by being in God s presence until we have the glory of God as our image.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to read 2 Corinthians 3 again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must take away all the coverings and hindrances in order to behold the Lord with an open face.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to the King James Version, 2 Corinthians 3:18 says, Beholding as in a glass..., but the word in is not in the Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It should read, Beholding as a glass....</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are the glass or mirror to behold the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we behold Him again and again, His image will be impressed upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that we are transformed into His image.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>So we must open ourselves to the Lord all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The problem with today s Christians is that they have the knowledge of religion with its forms and teachings and spend much time in studying the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, not many will spend time to open themselves to the Lord and remain in the shekinah glory of God as a real priest.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, there are different opinions, different concepts, different teachings and ideas, all of which only create divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our opinions create divisions, and divisions only create confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the real situation of Christianity today.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The recovery of the Lord is to deliver us out of opinions, concepts, methods, and words into the priestly experience of being transformed into the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We do not need to emphasize the teachings or methods.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We only need one thing to be in the presence of the Lord until we are transformed into His image.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we all would focus upon this, we would be one in the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are not one in the teachings, doctrines, or opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we return to our opinions and concepts, we might be divided into many divisions!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But once we enter into the priesthood and are brought into the shekinah glory of the Holy of Holies, all of our concepts will be swept away.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Prophecies shall fail, tongues shall cease, knowledge shall vanish away, but the priesthood will remain forever!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The most important matter is the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How much have you been saturated by the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is most important.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Before we can be the real priests, the Lord must deliver us from the outward things and bring us into reality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There are too many opinions and too many concepts in today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But praise the Lord that He has opened our eyes to see the basic, primary need of the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must be transformed into the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is why we must put on the new man, forgetting about ourselves, the old nature, and the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As long as we are living, walking, and serving according to the new man, we are in the image of God and in the reality of the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE AUTHORITY OF THE KINGSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>COMING FROM THE PRIESTHOOD</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The kingship follows the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we have the priesthood with the divine image, we will also have the divine authority.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Consider the Apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On one hand, they were the real priests; on the other hand, they were kings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After the day of Pentecost, Peter and the others were in the presence of the Lord and were even filled with the shekinah glory of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They were really in the priesthood and they also had the divine authority.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The high officials of both the Jews and the Romans could not deal with them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These poor fishermen were kings over all.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All of the Apostles were in the priesthood; therefore, they were the kings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Likewise, Moses, who was a priest, was committed with such authority.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Because he was in the reality of the priesthood, he had the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Today in the church, the authority of the eldership must come out of the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then the eldership is the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To be an elder, one must be in the presence of the Lord as a priest and be saturated and permeated by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then the kingship will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Do not think that you must exercise your authority as an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This never works!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The real eldership can only come from the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When we are really in the presence of the Lord, others will recognize the divine authority within.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The authority in the church follows the image.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When we have the image of the Lord in the priesthood, we will then have the authority of the kingship.</S>
