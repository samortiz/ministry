   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The word repentance appears frequently in Revelation 2 and 3 in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There, the Lord was dealing with the works of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He was calling for men to have a different view concerning their past works.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Revelation 2:5 says, "Remember therefore where you have fallen from and repent and do the first works; but if not, I am coming to you and will remove your lampstand out of its place, unless you repent."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord said this because they had left their first love.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They did not do the first works.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They had to remember from whence they had fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After this, they have to do the first works which are something of the future.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One has to repent of what he did in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The works in the future are a different matter altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 16 says, "Repent therefore; but if not, I am coming to you quickly, and I will make war with them with the sword of My mouth."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord was speaking here to the church in Pergamos.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some had followed the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They considered this teaching to be good.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That is why the Lord said that they needed to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They needed to consider that the work of the Nicolaitans was evil.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They needed to change their view and their concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 21 says, "And I gave her time that she might repent, and she is not willing to repent of her fornication."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>She had committed fornication, but she would not consider that as wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>She would not judge that as improper.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 22 says, "Behold, I cast her into a bed, and those who commit adultery with her, into great tribulation, unless they repent of her works."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This again shows us that they needed to repent of their past deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If they did not repent, the Lord would cast them into great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Revelation 3:3 says, "Remember therefore how you have received and heard, and keep it and repent."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here, the Lord is again calling them to repent, that is, to change their view concerning their behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 19 says, "As many as I love I rebuke and discipline; be zealous therefore and repent."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After seeing how the word is used in Luke, Acts, and Revelation, we can now understand what repentance really means in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Repentance is a change of mind.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But it is always used in reference to the deeds of the past and is never used in reference to conduct in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Repentance is a change in one's own mind, but what it deals with is in respect to the failures, the sins, the mistakes, the lack of zeal, and the ungodliness of the past.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means that we now see all these as wrong and improper.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the meaning of repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We may say that faith is our looking up to Christ, and repentance is our looking at ourselves in the light of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>While we are still sinners, the Holy Spirit shines into us and shows us ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is most necessary and is indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Without the enlightening of the Holy Spirit and the realization of ourselves, we cannot lift our eyes to the Lord Jesus.</S>
