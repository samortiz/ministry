DAVID'S CONCEPT&#151;PSALM 15</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. According to the Law Given by God at Sinai<br>alongside the Central Line of God's Economy</H2><P>In Psalm 15, David's concept was according to the law given by God at Sinai alongside the central line of God's economy. His concept in this psalm was not at Zion in the central line of God's economy. It was at Sinai. Do you love the name Sinai? According to Galatians 4, Sinai symbolizes a source that produced slaves, who are rejected by the grace of God (vv. 24-31). The law given by God at Sinai goes alongside the central line of God's economy. This side line always goes in parallel with the central line.</P><P>Satan is always where God is. The book of Job shows that Satan even went to the sanctuary in the heavens where God was (1:6-7). Before we are going to have a meeting, I pray desperately, asking the Lord to chase away all the darkness, all the demons, and all the evil spirits. This is because where God is, Satan is. Where the central line goes, the side line will come along to bother and distract you.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Perfect Man according to the Law</H2><P>Psalm 15:2-5 shows that David's concept in this psalm was that the perfect man according to the law could dwell with God for His heart's desire and good pleasure. Thus, verse 5 says that he who does these good things will not be shaken forever.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE DIVINE REVELATION&#151;PSALM 16</H2><P>Following Psalm 15, we see the divine revelation in Psalm 16.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. According to the Economy of God</H2><P>The divine revelation in Psalm 16 is according to the economy of God with Christ as its centrality and universality, ordained by God in eternity (Eph. 3:9, 11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The God-man, Christ</H2><P>Psalm 16 reveals the God-man, Christ, not the good man. God does not desire a good man, but a God-man. He does not desire a man with two "o's" as in the word good, but a man with one "o" as in the word God. Psalm 16 shows us Christ in His four stages: the stages of human living, death, resurrection, and ascension. Only God with His Spirit could write such a psalm. The human mind could never compose such a writing.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_055.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_057.html">Next</a> </body></html>
