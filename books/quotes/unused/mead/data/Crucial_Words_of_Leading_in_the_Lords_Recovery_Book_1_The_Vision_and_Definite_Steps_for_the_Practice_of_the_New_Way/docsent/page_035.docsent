   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Encouraging the Members of the Small Groups</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Function Organically</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1965 I visited Brazil for the first time to see the situation of Christianity there.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The brothers told me that Catholicism is the principal religion in Brazil, yet it is altogether dead, empty, without content, and full of superstitions.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As for Protestantism, it was mainly the Pentecostal movement that was there.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It was booming for a time, but eventually it withered like flowers and vanished like the lightning.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The only Christian group that lasted is called Congrega aon in Portuguese, equivalent to congregation in English.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This group spread to Brazil in 1915.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After more than fifty years in Brazil, at the time of my visit in 1965, it had more than three hundred thousand saints.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In S o Paulo alone there were thirty thousand saints, and more than one hundred small meeting places.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They did not have any speakers or preachers, and they required the believers to read the Bible purely.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For this reason I went to visit them, meet with them, and fellowship with their leading ones.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They showed me everything.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I found out that many of their practices are scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Later the brothers asked me if we should meet with them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I told them that there was a certain matter with which we could not get through in our fellowship; they do not receive all genuinely saved believers but only those who were baptized in their way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the practice of a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In other matters many of their practices are scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, they do not have preachers and ministers; instead, all the brothers and sisters function in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In their big meetings they put two microphones out, one for the brothers and one for the sisters, for testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They meet from 10:00 A.M. to 2:00 or 3:00 P.M. From their practice, we drew the conclusion that the most effective way to meet is to forsake the religious rituals and meet in small groups in the believers homes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The small group meeting should be held once a week, either in the morning or in the evening, and we should make it known to our friends, relatives, and neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Small Groups Being the Life Pulse</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>in the Propagation of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we all practice with diligence, what do you think the result will be?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It will create job opportunities for the saints and bring out their organic function.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we have only big meetings, who will dare to function?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All the one-talented ones will be buried because they dare not, cannot, and do not have the opportunity to function.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But once we practice the small groups, we create opportunities for the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Moreover, is there another way that is more effective in spreading the testimony of the Lord s recovery?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A great evangelist in America attracted one million people to his gospel campaigns, of which three hundred thousand people committed to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But from 1948 until today, where is the result of his work of thirty-eight years?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If he had begun to work on the home meetings and small group meetings thirty-eight years ago, I believe that the society of the United States today would have been turned around.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>With his great power and influence, he could gain at least a hundred thousand in a year.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How many would he have gained in the past thirty-eight years?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, because he took the way of big meetings, there is hardly any result today.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the past two decades, since I came to the United States, the number of Christians has been decreasing steadily.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christians are killed by the religious Sunday service.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The evangelist also found out the reason for the decline in the number of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When I first came to the United States, I heard him crying out to the believers, telling them to have small Bible studies and prayer meetings in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He also knew that sending the saved ones to the denominations could be compared to putting them into a freezer; this way only leads to death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, small-scale meetings were the trend in the United States about twenty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There were more than one thousand different small meetings in Southern California alone.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, I hope that the brothers and sisters will change their view.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we want the Lord s recovery to have a way, you and I must bear the responsibility of changing our views and concepts; we need to begin with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In this year and a half, eighty elders have been newly appointed in Taipei to bear the burden of leading and taking care of the twenty-one meeting halls.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now the practice of the new way is clear and definite.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The elders in every meeting hall must take this matter of the small group seriously and endeavor to carry it out.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In summary, first, there must be a big meeting on the Lord s Day morning, with a certain brother responsible to release a message in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If one person cannot bear this burden, two or three can bear it together.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These two or three should have fellowship once a week to see who is the appropriate one to release the message.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The responsibility should fall on the most suitable one.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we can do this in a proper way, our Lord s Day morning meeting will be able to bring in people.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Since the content of our message is weighty and full of light, the saints will spread the news around.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thus, those who like to listen to messages will come.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is something that is worth doing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, we should not stop here.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The big meeting is but an entrance.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Those who are brought in should be given to and taken care of by the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the proper practice.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Recovering the Dormant Saints</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Moreover, the elders of the various meeting halls should check the information cards of the saints and find out who is meeting regularly and who is not.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>For those who are meeting regularly, we need to find out their present condition, and for those who are not meeting regularly, we need to find out the reason and look into their present condition.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should study every case in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then we should make a copy of each card and distribute the copies to different small groups according to the addresses.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The small groups will then be responsible to visit the saints who are not meeting regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They may invite them for meals or have some simple fellowship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When they go out to visit these ones, they must keep in mind the principle of not being quick to give up after the first visit; rather, they should go in a persistent way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They may need to invite a certain one for a meal once a month for six months before he is willing to come to a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It may seem that the result is too slow, but they need to believe that fine products come from slow work.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Do not worry about being slow, but be wary of standing still.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Those who have not been meeting for a while may fear a big crowd.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But if they are invited to join the small group meeting in someone s home, they will feel more comfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Once they come to the small group and have some contact with the saints, their heart will gradually be warmed, their spirit will be supplied, and then they will remain.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Hence, whether or not the small groups are successful hinges on whether we have the heart to carry this out.</S>
