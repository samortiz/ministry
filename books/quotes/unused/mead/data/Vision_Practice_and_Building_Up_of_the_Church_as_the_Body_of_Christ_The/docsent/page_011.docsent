   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Our Full Sonship Requiring a Process</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>That Includes Suffering</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should spend more time considering the meaning of sonship in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Sonship includes our becoming a child of God by the new birth all the way to the manifestation of the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From regeneration to the manifestation of the sons of God there is a process for us to undergo.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many things are involved in this process.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we consider the process itself, we will see a mess.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have compared this process to preparing a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Preparing a feast includes shopping in the supermarket all the way to serving the many courses.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Between these two points there is a process, and the main part of the process is a mess in which the cook kills, cuts, scrapes, and mashes.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may also compare this process to cutting hair, which requires a number of instruments and also seems to make a mess.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the early years of my ministry, whenever I saw troubles in the church among the children of God, I was sorry and disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today, however, if a brother has a failure, we can praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Are there any problems?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Praise the Lord for the problems!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Without them nothing delicious will be cooked.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The potatoes have to be mashed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to suffer and undergo many things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may be sorry over the situation today, but the Lord is never sorry.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is happy, because He knows what He is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is doing the cooking work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One day, sooner or later, He will have the full sonship among His children, and He will have their manifestation in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The problem is that if we do not cooperate well with Him, we will delay Him and prolong the process.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, He is still wise.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The more we prolong the time, the better He will do the cooking.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am not saying, Let us do evil that good may come.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God is wise.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is wiser than we know.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We all have to realize that we are under the process.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We already have received the new birth, and now the goal in front of us is sanctification, glorification, full sonship, and the manifestation of the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we cooperate with Him, we will hasten the time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If not, we will prolong the time a little.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, to the Lord it is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Eventually He will work it out.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Eventually the whole universe will say, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>And the One on the throne will declare, Behold, I make all things new Rev 21:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For the sons of God to be new is for them to be matured.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The correct, full meaning of sonship spans the new birth to maturity, from regeneration to glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If this will impress us and we are clear about this, the Scriptures will be open to us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then our reading of the New Testament will be different from what it was in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God predestinated us unto this sonship, which starts from the new birth and consummates with maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I hope that from this time we all could be clear about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>SUBDUING THE ENEMY BY MAKING</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>GOD S WISDOM KNOWN THROUGH THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God created man in His own image Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This image is related to the sonship; the sonship is the fulfillment of God s image.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is by the sonship that eventually we will fully be in the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By the new birth we have the image of God within our spirit, and by transformation our soul will be conformed to the image of Christ Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then by transfiguration even our physical body will be conformed to the full likeness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At that time we will have the likeness, the image, of God fully and thoroughly, from within to without 1 John 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God s Purpose Being Not Only</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>That Man Bear God s Image</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>but Also That He Deal with His Enemy</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In His creation of man, God also committed His authority to man in order to subdue and deal with His enemy Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, the second item of God s purpose with the church is related to the second aspect of God s creation of man.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God s creation of man was first for man to be in His image and second to have His authority to deal with His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The church was predestinated for the sonship of God and also was destined to subdue the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In subduing the enemy, the church will make the wisdom of God manifest to all God s enemies Eph 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The serpent first appears in Genesis 3, and he will be cast out in Revelation 20.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Before Genesis 3 there are two chapters at the beginning of the entire Scripture, and after Revelation 20 there are two chapters at the end, but in between there is a long record.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>On the positive side, this record is full of many good stories concerning the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>On the negative side, there are also many victorious stories related to subduing and overcoming the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Finally, in Revelation 20 the ancient serpent will be bound and cast out vv.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>2-3, 10 .</S>
