<h2 class="head2">Dealing with Mammon to Take Care<br />of the Church's Need</h2><p>In the Old Testament, when Rachel left Laban, she took her images with her, and she was condemned (Gen. 31:32). Christians have to deal with mammon in the same way that they deal with idols. A Christian should not have idols in his house. In the same way, a Christian should not lay up for himself riches in his house. For God's children to lay up riches is the same as for them to touch idols. There are too many needs in the church. There are at least three needs. First, there is the need of the work. Second, there is the need of the poor brothers. Third, there is always the need of poor people. The Lord's Word says that the poor we have with us always (Matt. 26:11). We have to take care of the needs in these three areas.</p><h2 class="head2">Money Having to Go<br />before One Can Experience Deliverance</h2><p>Mammon is more serious than idols. When the church is strong, it will take the stand of voluntary poverty. In this way no false brothers will dare to come into the church, for once they come, they will have to sacrifice themselves. All those who come in through eloquence, intelligence, or wisdom will not be able to remain in the church. This will purify the church. When money goes out, a man is delivered. If you want to remain clean, you have to let your riches go.</p><p>In the Bible we can see the Lord's relationship with money through two cases. The first case was the paying of the temple tax (Matt. 17:24-27). In this case we see that the Lord did not carry any money in His pocket. The second case was His entrusting the money to Judas (John 12:6; 13:29). In that case we also see that the Lord's pocket did not carry money. Judas was the only one suitable to carry money.</p><h2 class="head2">No Excess through Much Gathering<br />and No Lack through Little Gathering</h2><p>Paul's principle was that those who gather much have no excess, and those who gather little have no lack (2 Cor. 8:15). This is the principle of coordination in our work. If those who gather much have excess and those who gather little have lack, it means that there is no coordination.</p><h2 class="head2">Offering Up Everything<br />and Keeping Only What One Needs</h2><p>Concerning offerings, it is not a matter of offering one-tenth or one-twentieth. It is a matter of everyone being as frugal as possible. Other than his own necessities, he should offer up all the rest. Anything less than this is not up to the proper standard of serving the Lord. Neither the Lord nor the church will want anything less than this standard. Everyone who serves the Lord has to forsake everything to follow Him. Other than providing for his own daily needs, a man should offer up everything. Those who lay up riches for themselves are the servants of mammon.</p><p>Consider how many procedures the idol worshippers have to go through! They have to kneel down, burn incense, and so forth. We have to realize that serving mammon is just as complicated as worshipping idols. The book of Matthew says that where our treasure is, there is our heart also (6:21). Then it speaks of the matter of laying up riches. In order for our hearts to be saved, we have to be delivered from the laying up of riches. Those who have not been delivered from riches have not been saved in their hearts.</p><h2 class="head2">Giving to the Poor for the Purpose<br />of Being Delivered from the Power of Mammon</h2><p>Some people are bound by the world, but the bondage of money is more serious than the bondage of the world. Why do we have to give to the poor? Giving to the poor is not merely for the sake of the poor. It is for the purpose of delivering ourselves from the power of mammon. When we do this, we promptly take care of the problem of money in our hands. Some people think that spending money on the poor is for the sake of the poor. Surely, it is a good thing for a poor person to be saved through our giving. But even if he is not saved, it is still a good thing for us to give. A person who cares much for money will go into eternity alone; no one will thank him. But those who spend money on others will find others welcoming them in the heavens. Those who offer themselves up in laboring must also offer themselves up in material giving. It is one thing to be poor. It is another thing to have the kind of poverty that Paul refers to, which enriches many (2 Cor. 6:10). The amount of excess we have is the amount of sin we have. The amount of excess we have is the amount of idols we have.</p>
