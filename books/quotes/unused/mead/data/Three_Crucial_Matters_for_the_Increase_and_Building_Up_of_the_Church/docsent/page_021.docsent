   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD S PROVISION IN FINANCES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to exercise faith toward the Lord, and look to Him for His blessing and His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We do not discuss money when someone is sent out for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is an established practice among us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is wrong for a person to think that because the work sends him out, it will also give him a specific amount of money.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is not our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we first came to Taiwan, the work did not arrange for any money to be given to me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The only one who supplied me was my senior co-worker, Brother Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 1933 when I was struggling with the decision of leaving my job and serving the Lord full time, Brother Nee was returning to China on a ship in the Mediterranean Sea, and he wrote me a letter confirming my decision to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When I received the letter, I was surprised, and I felt it was from the Lord; hence, I made a special trip to Shanghai to visit him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He asked me to stay in Shanghai for three or four months.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Once during that time, he came to the place where I was staying and said, Brother Witness, the Lord has given this for your use.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He then left me an envelope.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That was the first time that he supplied me financially, and it is deeply engraved on my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Later when he took the lead in the work to send me to Taiwan, in either April or May of 1949, he personally gave me three hundred U.S. dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That was how I came to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>My household consisted of twelve people: my wife and I, our eight children, and two helpers whom we could not leave behind.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We came as a household of twelve people and lived in a Japanese style house that was about three hundred square feet.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At that time most of the brothers and sisters who came from mainland China fled to Taiwan with the government.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Few people were wealthy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was at this time that two Chinese brothers from Manila came to Taiwan and saw the needs of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This was of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They bought a piece of land and gave it to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is part of the land on which hall one of the church in Taipei stands.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They also built a small meeting hall on the land, and we began to meet in it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After the work began on August 1, 1949, it spread rapidly, and the meeting hall was no longer adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Behind the meeting hall was a piece of land that had only the concrete foundations of houses that were bombed during the war.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A Taiwanese man was using the land to grow vegetables.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We felt to buy his rights to the land, and he agreed to sell his rights to us for almost two hundred U.S. dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We then went to the Bureau of National Assets for the parcel number of the land and to find out if it had been sold to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It had not been sold, so we immediately applied to buy the land.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In those days land was very cheap, and we purchased it for less than one thousand U.S. dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the land on which hall one stands.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In November 1950 I went to the Philippines to begin the work there, and I stayed there for five and a half months.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As I was about to leave the saints, a brother who was a businessman made an appointment and met with me.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He said that he would cover all the expenses for the spread of the Lord s work in Taiwan, regardless of how much it was.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even though I said that we never tell people how much money the work needs, he insisted that I was not telling him; rather, it was he who was asking me to please let him know how much was needed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>From that time onward, for a period of eleven years, this brother bore the financial responsibility for the work in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The land for most of the meeting halls in Taiwan was purchased during those years.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This was the Lord s provision.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord has blessed us not only in relation to our numbers and the work; He has also blessed us in material things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should not go by what we see; we must be determined to do whatever the Lord wants us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE LORD S MONETARY BLESSING</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When I went to America to begin the work there, I was empty-handed, just as I was when I came to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At the time I was still responsible for the monthly living expenses of several co-workers in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord began the work in America, and He is still blessing it to this day.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We obtained a large meeting hall in Anaheim, California, and another one in Irving, Texas.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These two meeting halls were given to us by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I am fellowshipping these matters because I want everyone to believe that the Lord blesses His work.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The publication work of the ministry office is taken care of at three stations.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One station is in Anaheim, the second station is our printing section in Irving, and the third station is the Taiwan Gospel Book Room in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There are more than sixty full-time serving ones in these three places.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There are more than twice that number of volunteers who come in to work; there are more than one hundred twenty volunteers.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All of this has been accomplished by the Lord.</S>
