   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We must also realize that the goal of the opposition today is twofold: to oppose the God-ordained way and to smear, to put down, and to put aside my ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Dear saints, suppose that today we put the God-ordained way aside and we put this ministry aside.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is left here today if we do this?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we reject the God-ordained way, we have no way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I know that if I do not take this way, my ministry will stop.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord showed me this ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If I would not take it or pass it on to the saints, I am finished in the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I have nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The speaking of God stops in me.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I want to convince you not to drop this way or reject this way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I love all of you because you love the Lord and the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You have sacrificed a lot to take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But I am a little concerned that you might be somewhat influenced to be hesitant about taking the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must be like the wise merchant mentioned in Matthew 13 who sold everything to buy the pearl of great price.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we practice the priestly preaching of the gospel, we are not carrying it out as we did in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to drop the old way of preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should not preach in the old way, which is the natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to preach in the spiritual way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First, we have to know what a priest is and how we can be proper priests.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A priest must be one who lives a daily life of revival.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is revived by the Lord every morning, and he participates in and enjoys the Lord's victory every day.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to be revived in the morning and victorious and overcoming during the day.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We also need to help the saints become this kind of revived, overcoming person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the daily life of a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then we have to realize that the priesthood is for the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first item to practice in the priesthood of the gospel is to visit sinners to get them saved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to bring the gospel to them so that they can be regenerated to become parts of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In our old way, we had big gospel meetings and invited people to come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These meetings were with one person speaking and the rest listening.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Most of us were just the helpers, the Levitical serving ones, who served one great priest, a gifted evangelist.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That is the old way, but the God-ordained way is not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the God-ordained way, every believer is a priest of the gospel, going to people with the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The gospel is just God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We go to people to bring God to them and to bring them back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After we baptize them, we need to sit down with them to converse with them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should not use vain words nor should we use too many verses from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We can use a few verses to impress these new ones that today Christ is the Spirit and that now they have Christ within them, in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to learn this new way.</S>
