   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A WORD OF FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING TRAINING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What we have seen thus far of a general sketch of the New Testament should be considered as a training.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You must now spend several years to try to put what you have seen into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Not Making Demands on Others</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In addition, you must never put demands on any person, church, or group according to what you have received.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To put demands on others or on the church is not a help; rather, it is a great damage.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you want to make demands, make demands on yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do not say to others, "Now my eyes are opened.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have been trained in a certain way, but you don't have this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, the church here is too poor."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Demanding never helps the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The right thing to do is to supply and minister.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The training meetings are completely different from the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is a problem when some do not differentiate the two kinds of meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The one who conducts a training has the ground to say certain things to the trainees, but you do not have the same ground with others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you speak things in the same way as in a training meeting, you may damage the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, do not treat other people as trainees.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You may treat only yourself as a trainee.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the mainland of China, some brothers after being trained became a great help to the local churches, but others went back to their localities and became a big damage.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They treated the church as their trainees, and they made demands on the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You are not trained to make people your trainees.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, you are trained to grow, to minister, and to supply something from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You are trained even to suffer loss for others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Not Criticizing or Causing Divisions</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In addition, whenever you make a demand, you are tempted to criticize.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You may realize the true situation with others, but do not criticize them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do not believe in yourself too much when you see the situation, because your realization about it may not be correct.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Apparently a person's situation is of one kind, but in actuality it may be of another kind, so it is foolish to discern things too fast.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Be careful in speaking about a situation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Just consider how easy it is for others to misunderstand you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the same way, you may feel that a certain brother is not right, but before the Lord he may be very right.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, we must be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After we are trained, our eyes are opened to a certain extent, and it is easy for us to discern things according to our new understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As a result, we are tempted first to criticize others and then to cause divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is one hundred percent wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Never go to a place or remain in your place to discern things according to your training and then criticize and make divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you do this, you will never be a help to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Rather, you will damage it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Supplying the Body</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Learn to be humble, faithful, and honest, and always do your best not to contradict.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Always do your best to minister help to others in a quiet way without contradicting.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this way you will supply nourishment, solid food, to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Body needs this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is no need to adjust others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If there is something wrong in the Body, the supply will take care of it spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The supply is like a dose of medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you administer the dose, the medicine will eventually get into the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then if there is a germ, some element in the medicine will kill it unconsciously.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the past I have said that you must be aggressive, and that is right.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, I now advise you to not be a troublemaker in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As those who have been trained, we must be careful.</S>
