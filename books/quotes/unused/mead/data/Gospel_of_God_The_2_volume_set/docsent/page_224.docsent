   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Bible, whether with the Lord Jesus, or with the apostles, the words they spoke concerning the reward and the kingdom were not spoken lightly, in the same way the gift and eternal life were not spoken of lightly.</S>

   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What then is the reward?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Bible clearly shows us that the reward is the crown, the throne, and the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The kingdom of the heavens is the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Bible, there are three aspects to the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the first aspect, the kingdom of the heavens is theoutward manifestation of God's authority today; it is the outward manifestation of God's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible calls this the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The second aspect is the authority of the heavens controlling and limiting man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is also called the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, there is a third aspect of the kingdom of the heavens; it refers to the reward.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many are familiar with the Beatitudes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Chinese call them the Eight Blessings.</S>

Rejoice and exult, for your reward is great in the heavens" Matt 5:11-12 . Here we must admit that the reward is the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
