<H1 CLASS=SERIES> LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE FOURTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE TWO TREES</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><P>In the previous message we have seen that the tree of knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan, who has the power of death, the contents of which are all things apart from God and the nature and result of which are both death. Now we have to see what is the principle of this tree.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD6>d) Its Principle&#151;to Be Independent</H2><P>If we know the principle of the tree of life, we will also know the principle of the tree of knowledge, for it is opposite the principle of the tree of life. The principle of the tree of life is dependence; the principle of the tree of knowledge is independence. Anything we do in dependence upon the Lord is in the principle of the tree of life. Anything we do independently of the Lord is in the principle of the tree of knowledge.</P><P>Everyone wants to be independent. However, we should never be independent of the Lord. Spiritual independence means death. If we are independent, we kill ourselves.</P><P>To be independent of the Lord means to have an insulation separating us from the Lord, an insulation which cuts off the flow of divine electricity. Although we may have an electrical power plant with tremendous resources and all the necessary equipment properly installed, all is useless if there is insulation at the switch. That insulation severs the flow of electricity. Only a slight amount of insulation, perhaps a paper-thin layer, will cut off the flow. Indepen-dence is a spiritual insulation, disconnecting us from the life of God. Do not think of yourself as an expert in spiritual matters. Regardless of how long electricity has been applied, it still needs application without insulation. It is the same in the spiritual realm. Never say, "I have much experience in Christ. I have been exercising my spirit for years and I don't need to do it any more." We should never adopt this attitude. We need to depend on the Lord continually. Never be independent of the living Lord. One second of independence means death.</P>
