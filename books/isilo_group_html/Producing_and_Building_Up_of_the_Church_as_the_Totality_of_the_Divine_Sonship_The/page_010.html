ASCENDED CHRIST DWELLING IN THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>The crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ, the very Christ in the third heaven, has entered into our being to dwell there. Do not ask how this can be. It is marvelous and mysterious. On the one hand, Christ is in the third heaven, but on the other hand, He is dwelling within us. Romans 8:34 says that Christ is at the right hand of God, but verse 10 says, &ldquo;Christ is in you.&rdquo; Today Christ is both the ascended Christ in the heavens and the indwelling Christ within us. This is altogether not a matter of religion, rituals, formal service, or mere doctrinal teachings. Rather, it is a matter of the living Christ, who passed through crucifixion and resurrection, who is now in ascension, and who is living within us. We do not care for Christianity; we care only for Christ. We need to drop every <em>-anity,</em> that is, every form of religion, and come back to the living Christ. We are forced to say this because Christianity today has been befuddled. We may illustrate the situation in Christianity by the smell of garlic. If a room is filled with garlic, the people in it lose their ability to smell it, but if someone comes in from the fresh air, he will immediately smell the odor. Christianity today has lost its &ldquo;sense of smell&rdquo; concerning the real things of Christ. Many in Christianity talk only concerning ways to worship God, ways to meet, whether to be silent or loud, and various doctrinal teachings and regulations.</p>
<p>A certain Christian worker once complained that the saints in the church life come together to sing hymns, pray boldly, and say Amen, Hallelujah! even before the meeting begins. He said that the best way to meet is to come into the hall in a quiet way, take a seat, and pray silently until the meeting time. He also felt that it is not good for the saints to shout, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, praise You!&rdquo; However, if one group of Christians sits quietly, and another comes together to praise the Lord and declare boldly, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, we love You,&rdquo; which would the Lord Jesus enjoy more? We find this situation in the Bible. When the Lord Jesus entered Jerusalem for the last time, the people shouted and praised loudly. The Pharisees wanted to rebuke the people, but the Lord said, &ldquo;If these shall be silent, the stones will cry out&rdquo; (Luke 19:37-40). Our meetings should not be like a cemetery, in which everything is quiet, proper, and in good order because everyone there is dead. Psalms often tells us to make a joyful noise to the Lord (81:1; 95:1-2; 98:4, 6; 100:1). We do not insist on praising the Lord in a certain way; rather, we simply need to care for the indwelling Christ.</p>
<p>We need to realize that Christ, the living One, dwells within us. I was born into and raised in fundamental Christianity, and I pursued the inner life and was even involved with the Pentecostal things. I received many teachings, but in all those years I never heard a message telling me that the Lord Jesus, my Savior and Redeemer, is the living One who dwells within me. However, one day the Lord&rsquo;s mercy granted me the vision that the One who died on the cross for me and is now in the heavens as the Lord of all lives and moves in me. This is not a matter of religion, regulations, formality, or mere teaching. It is altogether a matter of a living person in us.</p>
<p>We need to read the New Testament again with this view. The New Testament charges us mainly to do one thing: to walk according to the spirit. Romans 8, for example, does not tell us to love our wives, honor our parents, or other similar things. It simply tells us to walk according to the spirit and to set our mind on the spirit (vv. 4, 6). This is because the Lord Jesus is the life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 13:5; Gal. 2:20). Second Timothy 4:22a says, &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit,&rdquo; and 1 Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; Today our God, Savior, Redeemer, Lord, and Christ is not only in the third heaven but also living in our spirit as the life-giving Spirit. He is one with us, and we are one with Him in our spirit. Therefore, as we walk according to the spirit, the all-inclusive Christ, who is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, infuses us and saturates every part of our being for our transformation. Second Corinthians 3:17 and 18 say, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&rdquo; This is the basic revelation of the New Testament. It is not a mere teaching, instruction, or religion; it is a revelation concerning the living Christ.</p>
<p>We must never forget that the living Christ is the crucified, resurrected, ascended, and exalted One. In His death He solved all the problems and dealt with all the negative matters, and in His resurrection He imparted Himself into us to make us the many grains, His brothers, and the sons of God. Then in His ascension He brought us into the heavens, where everything is now under our feet. Moreover, He is living within us to be our life, patience, endurance, love, holiness, and everything to us in order to transform us into His image from one degree of glory to another. What a Christ we have! It is in such a Christ that we are the church. The church is not something ordinary; it is outside of religion and doctrinal teaching. It is a living composition of the crucified, resurrected, ascended, indwelling, living Christ and all His regenerated and transformed believers. Therefore, we need to forget all the wrong things that we picked up in Christianity. We do not want the things of religion. We want Christ, the living One. Because we are one with Him and He is one with us, we are in Him and also in the third heaven.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Producing and Building Up of the Church as the Totality of the Divine Sonship &nbsp; pg 10</div><br></body></html>
