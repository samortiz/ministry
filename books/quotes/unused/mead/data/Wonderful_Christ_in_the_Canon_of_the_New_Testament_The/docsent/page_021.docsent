   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GREATER THAN EVERYTHING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>During this time Jesus revealed Himself to the people as the greater Temple 12:6 , the greater Jonah 12:44 , the greater Solomon 12:42 , and the Lord of the Sabbath 12:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many Christians love the Gospel of John because it tells us that Jesus is the life, the truth, the way, the door, and so many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But some of the things Matthew revealed, John never touched.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>John did not tell us that Jesus was the greater Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Neither did he tell us that Jesus was the Lord of the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Matthew, we see that Jesus is greater than everything, because He is everything!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we have Him, we have God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we have Him, we have God s prophet, God s insight, and God s wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we have Him, we have God s authority and kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And if we have Him, we have the real rest.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>BROKEN REEDS AND SMOKING FLAX</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Jesus is such a wonderful person!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is not only wonderful with God, but also with man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He never breaks a bruised reed, and He never quenches smoking flax Matt 12:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In ancient times, the Jewish children made the reeds into a kind of musical instrument.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever the reed was bruised, it would not emit the proper sound, so the children would break it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But Jesus never breaks any bruised reed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sometimes we are just as these bruised instruments.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should give forth a good sound, but we do just the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As a rule we should be broken, but Jesus would never do that.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He would come in to rearrange us that the beautiful music might come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In those days the Jews used burning flax when they traveled at night.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the oil ran out, the flax would begin to smoke, so they would quench it and cast it away.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many times we are just as smoking flax.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should be shining, but rather we are smoking.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As a rule, the Lord should quench us and cast us away.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But He will never do that.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Jesus knows why we are smoking.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is because we are short of oil.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, instead of quenching us, He supplies us with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the flax gets the oil, it burns.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not be disappointed in some of the smoking brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We only need to supply them with oil, that they might burn to give the light.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Jesus is such a wonderful person!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is not a breaker or a quencher; He is a rearranger and a supplier.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not say that you are a hopeless case.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Nothing is hopeless with Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is very capable at rearranging.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He can rearrange us for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In ourselves we are not qualified, but Jesus qualifies us with His life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Regardless of how bruised or smoking we are, Jesus can rearrange us and supply us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hallelujah for such a One!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE MYSTERIOUS JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>While Jesus was traveling and saying so many wonderful things, the religious ones were continually questioning Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Pharisees, the ancient fundamentalists, and the Sadducees, the ancient modernists, joined together with the political parties to question Him Matt 22:15-40 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They tried their utmost to pin Him down, but they just could not.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is the wisest of all men; He answered all of their questions.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When they finished, He asked them a question.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What think ye of Christ? whose son is he?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Matt 22:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The religious ones who had the knowledge of the Bible quickly answered that He was the son of David.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then Jesus answered, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Matt 22:43-45 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They could not answer Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>And from that time they asked Him no more questions.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It simply means that Jesus is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They only knew one aspect, but there is another aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They knew Christ as the son of David, but they did not know Him as the Lord of all.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Even David, who was before Him, called Him Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should never think that we know Jesus fully.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We may only know a fragment.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He is too full and unsearchably rich.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We can know Jesus, but we cannot know Him to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is why He said, No man knoweth the Son, but the Father Matt 11:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Praise the Lord that Jesus is such a mystery!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the last twelve years in this country we have seen more things about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But even in eternity, we will have more and more discoveries of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He is so rich!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We all must open ourselves continually to know Him in a deeper and richer way.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I do believe that in the coming years we will see something more, something deeper, something higher, something fuller, and something richer about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He is so wonderful and unsearchable.</S>
