   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EATING CHRIST AND LIVING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The theologians in Christianity do not have the concept of eating Christ and living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If they hear this kind of speaking "eating Christ to become Christ" they are bothered and are quick to judge it as heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They wonder first of all, how can we eat Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Secondly, how can we become Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, the Bible is very clear concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord Jesus said, "He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me" John 6:57 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This word is not my speaking; it is the speaking of the Lord Jesus and is recorded in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Later, a disciple who was called Paul also declared, "For to me, to live is Christ" Phil 1:21a .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Can you see this?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Eat Christ and live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The words eat and live are not adjectives but verbs.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I eat Christ and I live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eventually, to me, to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is not heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have been fighting for this truth for many years in America.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>America is known as a Christian nation, and it has old, traditional theology.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since the Lord's recovery went to America, we have released messages on eating Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The theologians and seminary professors in that country said, "This man from China is of a small stature, yet he is so bold; we have never heard such a thing as eating Christ!"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They began to fight against this teaching, and we also fought back.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After fighting for a period of time, they stopped and conceded defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is because the light in the Bible is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is sufficient simply to read John 6:57, where the Lord Jesus said, "He who eats Me."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, they could not argue any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After that, we released messages declaring that if you eat Christ, you will become Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They began fighting again, saying, "Now we have found reason to say that you indeed teach heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ is God, so how can you say that you are Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do you really mean to say that you can become God?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But Paul clearly said in Philippians 1:21, "To me, to live is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now let me ask you if you can declare, "To me, to live is Christ"?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Can you?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Your "amen" is quite feeble.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I know you may be thinking, "This word is right and is clearly in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, I am not Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>An hour before the meeting time, I had an exchange of words with my wife at the dinner table.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How can I say that I am Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I cannot lie, so I cannot say that I am Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, if I ask you if you can declare, "To me, to live is Christ," you can only utter a soft "amen."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is not a proper Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today Christians will not make this declaration, "To me, to live is Christ," mainly because they disobey the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is a pitiful situation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Nevertheless, we need to see that a Christian who is up to the standard is one who eats Christ and who lives out Christ; perhaps we should not use the word "out" and simply say, who lives Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>MAN'S TWO SINS BEFORE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the Bible we see that in this time of the New Testament, man has only two sins before God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you are not a believer, you will go to the lake of fire and perish there not because of any other sin but because of your not believing into the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In John 16:9, the Lord said, "Concerning sin, because they do not believe into Me."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The unique sin of the unbelievers before God today is the sin of unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is because God does not charge us to do anything other than to receive the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the Old Testament there were the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the New Testament, however, there is only the one commandment: Repent and believe in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the one and only commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whether you commit sins or do good, you should repent and believe in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you do not believe in Jesus, your unbelief is sin; this is the unique sin.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the future all the perishing ones will go to the lake of fire not because of stealing or lying but because of not believing in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many good men will end up in the lake of fire in the coming age, even though they have never committed murder, robbery, or adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Perhaps they will argue with God, saying, "I have not sinned, so why am I here in the lake of fire?"</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God will say, "It is because you do not believe in Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>People perish because of their unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After believing in the Lord, we have another sin.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Many brothers and sisters are not sensitive to this.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What is this sin?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is the sin of not living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Your not living Christ and not living by Christ is the greatest sin.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I saw this many years ago but did not have a strong consciousness of it until mid-July of last year when I was on a mountain having a quiet, intimate time with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>At that time I practiced confessing my sins daily.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Whenever I had a wrong intention, said a wrong word, or had a wrong attitude, I would confess my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Every day I would confess my sins just like I would wash my hands.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then the Lord asked me, "Have you ever confessed this one sin, that you do not live Christ?"</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I said, "Lord, forgive me!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I have not confessed this sin.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Although I have confessed saying the wrong thing or having a wrong attitude, I never confessed this sin of not living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>O Lord, I do not live You out.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>O Lord, I do not live You.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>O Lord, forgive me!"</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>From that day on, I would confess this sin thoroughly before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then I found out that there is no end to the daily confession of this sin.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is extremely difficult for us to live Christ every moment of the day.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I did a little calculating for myself and for others as well.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>There are twenty-four hours in a day.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>After deducting eight hours for sleeping, there are still sixteen hours.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>How much of the remaining sixteen hours do I spend living Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I found out that I may not even have two hours of living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In the other fourteen hours although I did not commit any sin, neither did I live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Do you see this?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Within the sixteen waking hours, I had only two hours at most in which I was living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>These two hours of living Christ started with my prayer time.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In fact, at the beginning of my prayer time, I was not in my spirit but still in my mind.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Then gradually I prayed myself into my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When I prayed myself into my spirit, I lived Christ in my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>When I prayed, I lived Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>After praying, I was living in my spirit, but this did not last long.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>After five minutes Sister Lee asked me, "Yesterday you gave some money to So-and-so.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Why did you not discuss this with me first?"</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Her questioning halted my living of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Immediately I turned to my mind, asking, "What is this?"</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This was not to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>I spent the next fifteen minutes telling her all the reasons, and in those fifteen minutes I did not live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>What did I live?</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Even I myself do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>I did not sin or lose my temper, but neither was I in my spirit living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This would go on until two or three o'clock in the afternoon; then I sensed something was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>I turned to the Lord to confess, "Lord, I did not live Christ throughout the day.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Although I did not do anything wrong, I have been living in myself.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Lord, I am not trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Lord, forgive my sin!</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Lord, remind me that I am one spirit with You, and You are one spirit with me.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>I do not want to live outside of this spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>I want to live only in this spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>After my confession I felt much better within and sensed the Lord's sweetness, and I was again in my spirit living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>However, at this moment the phone rang, and I picked up the receiver.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>That one phone call got me out of my spirit again.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Also there were times when the telephone did not ring, and I was just working and not committing any wrong, yet I still was not living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>What do I live when I am not living Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>First, ethics; second, logic; and third, biblical teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>For example, when a husband and wife who are believers quarrel, they condemn themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>But suppose that, instead of quarreling, they love each other, yet not in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Since not loving each other in the spirit is not counted as a sin, they do not condemn themselves but rather consider that they are doing the right thing.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>In this way, every day we live mostly either according to ethics or according to logic; we spend very little time living Christ in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>One day I did a little more calculating.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>I am afraid that even the best brothers and sisters among us live Christ only five percent of the time; ninety-five percent of the time they do not live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Some are contentious and do not live Christ; others are peaceable and never say much, but they also do not live Christ.</S>
