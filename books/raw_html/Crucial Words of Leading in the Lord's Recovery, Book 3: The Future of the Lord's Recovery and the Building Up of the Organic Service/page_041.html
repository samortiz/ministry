	 <h2 class="head1">BUILDING UP THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>It is precious to consecrate ourselves to serve full time, but we must not bring in our natural life. There used to be many co-workers. After we were raised up by the Lord, none of us had any desire to do anything for ourselves. We all had only one goal&mdash;the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Therefore, we did not have any problems, and no one played tricks in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I led the church in a certain locality, building up the church there, but I never felt that the church was built up by me, or that it was in my pocket. I did not have such a feeling. We all had such a spirit, following the footsteps of Brother Nee&rsquo;s leadership.</p>
<p>However, with time there were some who had difficulties. Some saints came into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, expecting to find an opportunity to promote themselves. When they were unable to promote themselves, they left us and became preachers in Christianity. Several of the famous Chinese preachers were with us for a time and then turned away to establish their own work. I believe they know that the way they are taking is not right. They know that there is only one church. But they were forced to begin another work because they wanted to do something for themselves.</p>
<p>In 1965 I spoke a word of warning to a few brothers who wanted to leave the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I told them that not long after they leave they would divide again and again, because they rejected the ground of the church. My warning to those brothers has been fulfilled. They did not just separate themselves from others, they also divided among themselves again and again. All of you who serve full time must know that your serving is truly of the Lord, and it is precious that you have received grace and are willing to serve full time. However, you must take this warning and be inoculated. You should not think that you can consecrate yourselves to live for the Lord; you should not have great resolutions or great searchings in yourselves. On the contrary, you must always remember that the Lord has only one work on this earth, and that work is to build up His Body. There is only one church in the universe, and there is only one expression of that church in a locality.</p>
<p>You can do your best to develop the gifts that you have received from the Lord, and there is absolutely no restriction in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery concerning this matter. However, you must adhere to the one principle of not doing any other work and not using gimmicks in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. You should only carry out your function. Do not say that you have built up a church, and do not consider any church as your church. Every church is the Lord&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy the church in Chefoo was built up mainly through my ministry; however, I never considered the church in Chefoo to be my personal church. At a certain point in time, the Lord raised up an environment that forced me to leave Chefoo. When I left, I did not give anyone instructions concerning the church and the work. I simply told the responsible brothers that I had to leave, and I left. After China won the Sino-Japanese War, the Lord led me to Shanghai, and I ministered there for two and a half years. This brought in a revival to the church. Even though I was taking the lead, none of the church affairs were in my hand. Hence, when the time came for me to leave, I got on a plane and left. That was also the situation when I left Taiwan to go to America. No matter where I am, I always serve in coordination with the local brothers.</p>
<p>We must always remember this principle: we are here only to labor and to expend our energy in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to build up His Body. We want to explain this matter clearly to the young people because we hope that you will not have ambitions or great aims. We hope that you would simply be faithful and live Christ in every circumstance. You must gain people for the Lord, build them up, and perfect them. Everything you do must be for the church in your locality. No local church belongs to you or to me. Every local church belongs to Christ, to God, and to the saints. In the New Testament there are three designations for the church: the church of God (1 Cor. 1:2; 10:32), the church of Christ (Rom. 16:16), and the church of the saints (1 Cor. 14:33). No church belongs to an apostle, no church belongs to an elder, and no church belongs to a co-worker. The church belongs to the saints, and we should only take the position of being one of the many saints enjoying the church. Perhaps some churches were raised up through our work, or some saints were saved through our work, but those churches are still the churches of the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PROMOTING THE GOSPEL IN THE HOMES<br />
BY PREACHING FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE</h2>
<p>Acts 5:42 says, &ldquo;Every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and announcing the gospel of Jesus as the Christ.&rdquo; Recently, a Roman Catholic organization put out a publication that praised us, because we practiced serving in homes and in small groups before 1958. The author felt that such a practice is very effective.</p>
<p>Before 1958 every move we took in leading the church was according to the Bible. We had home meetings based on the expression <em>from house to house</em> in Acts 5:42 and 2:46. In Shanghai and in Chefoo we met in the homes, but we did not meet in groups. Later, when we came to Taiwan, the number of saints increased rapidly, and it was not enough to divide into homes; we also had to have groups. The practice of meeting in groups is based on the record in Luke 9 where the Lord fed five thousand people with five loaves and two fish. In that chapter the Lord said, &ldquo;Make them recline in groups of about fifty each&rdquo; (v. 14). The Greek word for <em>group</em> refers to a small unit or company.</p>
<p>When the church in Taipei first began to practice meeting in groups, there were not many saints in each group; there were only about twenty. Then later, the numbers gradually increased until a group had as many as one hundred saints. After much practice and observation, we needed to reduce the numbers in our groups. According to the Bible, twelve people can be considered a group, because the first group of early disciples was the twelve apostles. There are about fifteen thousand saints in the church in Taipei, and about five thousand of these meet regularly. There are usually three or four thousand saints meeting every Lord&rsquo;s Day. If we were to form groups of twelve, the entire church in Taipei could meet in three to four hundred groups. The groups should not be formed according to the spiritual level of the saints but according to their residential location. The principle of meeting from house to house is to split up into groups. As soon as we are in groups, it is easy to shepherd, teach, and care for others in a detailed way. This is the basic unit for our future development.</p>
<p>Acts speaks of preaching the gospel from house to house. When the early disciples preached the gospel, they did not preach only in the temple but also in the homes. Every brother and sister opened his or her home for the preaching of the gospel, and they invited their relatives, friends, and neighbors. Every household preached the gospel. If we cannot preach the gospel every week, we should do it at least every other week or once a month.</p>
<p>At this point we must commend the sisters, because the gospel in the homes is built on the sisters for the following reasons. The brothers are busier during the day because they go out to work; their hearts are not necessarily concerned with the homes. The sisters are the stronger ones in the church in the matter of loving the Lord. The Bible records two instances of sisters anointing the Lord with fragrant ointment; one is in Luke 7:36-39, and the other is in Matthew 26:6-13. The brothers were rational, cold, and calculating, so they thought that the fragrant ointment could be sold for much money, which could be given to the poor. Hence, the gospel in the homes should not be committed to the brothers. We must let the sisters take care of it. We must motivate the sisters. Furthermore, people are more likely to refuse an invitation from the brothers, but they will feel somewhat embarrassed to refuse an invitation from the sisters. Hence, we must emphasize the function of the sisters in promoting the preaching of the gospel in the homes until every home is open for the gospel.</p>
<p>The brothers who serve with the name lists of those in the church should tell us how many household units there are. If the church in Taipei has twelve hundred households, it means that there are twelve hundred gospel stations in the church. If every one of these twelve hundred homes can gain an average of three people per year, then the entire church can save thirty-six hundred people in a year. I have the assurance that if all the saints faithfully receive this commission, the church in Taipei will be able to double its number in the near future.</p>
