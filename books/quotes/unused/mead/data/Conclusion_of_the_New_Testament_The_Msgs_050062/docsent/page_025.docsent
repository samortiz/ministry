   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Depths of God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Corinthians 2:10 says, "The Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The depths of God refer to the deep things of God, which are Christ in many aspects as our eternal portion, foreordained, prepared, and given to us freely by God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These deep things have never arisen in man's heart, but they are revealed to us in our spirit by God's Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Spirit of God explores the depths of God concerning Christ and shows them to us in our spirit for our realization and participation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, we must be spiritual in order to partake of them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must move and live in our spirit so that we may enjoy Christ as everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ Himself is the depths of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every genuine Christian knows that Christ is the Savior who died on the cross for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, to know Christ in this way is to know only superficial things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To know the depths of God is to know Christ in many aspects as our eternal portion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ is the center of God's economy, the portion given to us by God for our enjoyment and the mysterious wisdom hidden in God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's wisdom in a mystery is Christ as the deep things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, the depths of God are Christ Himself as the mysterious and hidden wisdom, the focus of God's economy, and the portion given to us by God for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ, the all-inclusive and extensive One, is truly the depths of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may be believers and yet not know the depths of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to know God according to His depths, knowing those matters which God regards as deep.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we would know the depths of God, the deep things of God, we need to know the books of Romans, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, Hebrews, John, and Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But not even these books, books that reveal deep and profound matters, tell us that Christ, the last Adam in the flesh, has become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only in 1 Corinthians 15:45 do we have such a statement.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Moreover, only in 1 Corinthians does Paul say, "He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit" 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What is deeper than this?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is deeper than the last Adam becoming the life-giving Spirit and our being joined to the Lord as one spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These things are unfathomable; they are immeasurably deep and profound.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order to know Christ as the depths of God, we need to know that through incarnation God one day became a man named Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Through His crucifixion the Lord Jesus terminated the old creation and released the divine life that it might be imparted to all those who believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now, in resurrection, He is the life-giving Spirit who indwells our spirit and who has become one spirit with us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have a mingled spirit within us, our regenerated human spirit mingled with the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is a very deep matter.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we consider the context of the whole book of 1 Corinthians, we shall have the assurance to interpret the depths of God in 2:10 as referring to the all-inclusive Christ who, as the life-giving Spirit, indwells our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After accomplishing redemption, this Christ became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As such, He is so available to us that we are joined to Him as one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nothing is deeper than this.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we enjoy Christ continually, we shall eventually enter into the depths of God's being.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then we shall realize that we are in the very heart, the depths, of the almighty God, and that He is becoming our inner element.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then in Christ we shall be mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we enjoy Christ, we touch the depths of God, and God becomes the element within us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ is practical to us in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is not only our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption 1 Cor 1:30 but also the depths of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because our experience is limited, we are not able to explain adequately what it means for Christ to be the depths of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But one day we shall advance in our experience and we shall truly know Him as God's depths.</S>
