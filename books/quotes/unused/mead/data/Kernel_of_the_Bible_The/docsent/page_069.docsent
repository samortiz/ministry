   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY WALKING IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the New Testament there are three verses that speak of both the human spirit and the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John 3:6 says that our spirit is born of the divine Spirit; John 4:24 says that God is Spirit and that those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit; and Romans 8:16 says that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many who have been Christians for years have never seen the two spirits in these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Not long ago two brothers among us visited some preachers in a certain city.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One brother began to speak about the two spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because those preachers were proud and thought that they knew everything about the Spirit, they asked the brothers to talk about something else.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At this point the other brother said, You have told us that you know everything about the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Please tell me: what are the three verses in the Bible that speak of the two spirits?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Unable to locate the verses, the preachers could only look at one another.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE HUMAN SPIRIT BORN OF THE DIVINE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>John 3:6 says, That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first spirit in this verse is God s Spirit, and the second is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that our spirit is born of God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This verse is found in the most familiar chapter in the Bible, John chapter three.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nearly every believer is able to recite John 3:16, but not many are able to recite verse 6.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to be deeply impressed with this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It tells us that our spirit is born of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How mysterious is this birth in our spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The birth of the spirit in John 3:6 is not the first birth, the natural birth; it is the second birth, the spiritual birth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All the saved ones have been born twice.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you have had only one birth, you are still a fallen one, destined to perish.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first birth, from our parents, is the birth in the flesh; the second birth, from God, is the birth in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to John 3:6, the second birth transpires in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In our spirit we were born of God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many Christians are not clear about the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some great Christian teachers have said that our spirit is simply our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What a terrible mistake!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If this is true, then the wonderful birth spoken of in John 3:6 takes place in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How absurd to say this!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If even some of the great teachers in Christianity are not clear about the birth in the spirit, then what about the vast majority of Christians?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As far as the spirit and life in the Spirit are concerned, the situation in Christianity is pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Not many actually realize that the spiritual birth takes place in our spirit and is of God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Anyone who has not experienced the second birth can be born of the Spirit by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you call, O Lord Jesus! the Spirit of God will come into your spirit and you will immediately experience the second birth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hallelujah for the second birth!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are the second-birth people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Never forget the two spirits in John 3:6 the human spirit and the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>WORSHIPPING GOD IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Another precious verse about these two spirits is John 4:24.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This verse says, God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Here again we see that God is a Spirit and that we have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we would worship God, we must worship Him in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As human beings, we have many organs: eyes for seeing, ears for hearing, a mouth for speaking and eating, a nose for smelling and breathing, hands for working, and feet for walking.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We also have our various inward organs, including a stomach for retaining and digesting food.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In addition to all these organs, we have a spirit with which to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Man was made by God and for God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He was made to worship God, to contact God, to receive God, to retain God, and even to digest God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Your religious mentality may be offended at the thought of digesting God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Yes, we must digest God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord Jesus said that He was the bread of life and that we must eat Him John 6:35, 54-57 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Jesus is edible!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we eat Him, we must also digest Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The function of the organ of our spirit is to worship, contact, receive, retain, and digest God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We may call this organ our spiritual stomach.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Just as we all have two hearts, a physical heart and a psychological heart, we also have two stomachs.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>With our physical stomach we digest food, and with our spiritual stomach we digest God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Have you ever realized that in addition to your physical stomach you also have a spiritual stomach?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Often, after being satisfied with food which fills our physical stomach, we are still hungry in our spirit, our spiritual stomach.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the organ for digesting God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need to receive God into this part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We all have a spirit, and we must use our spirit to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Consider the example of breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In order to breathe in air, we need to use our nose.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We cannot use our hand to grasp the air, our eyes to look at it, or our ears to hear it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There is only one organ designed for receiving air, and that organ is the nose.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Whenever we exercise this organ, we receive air into us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Likewise, our spirit is the proper organ to use in receiving God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Never say that there is no God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Do not say, I don t believe in God, because I can t see Him or grasp Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>You cannot grasp Him unless you use the right organ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Just as we exercise our nose to take in fresh air, we must exercise our spirit to receive God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Do not exercise your mind to ask where God is and then complain that you cannot see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God is present, even omnipresent.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He is with you right now.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But if you try to contact Him with your mind, you are using the wrong organ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Forget about exercising your mind to contact God, and exercise your spirit from deep within, calling, O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If you do this, God will immediately come into you.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God is a Spirit, and we worship Him in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Thus, the human spirit worships the divine Spirit.</S>
