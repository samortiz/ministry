<h2 class="head1">THE INTRINSIC GROWTH OF THE CHURCH<br />
FOR ITS ORGANIC INCREASE</h2>
<p>In the last chapter, we saw the intrinsic essence of the church for its organic existence. Now we want to see the intrinsic growth of the church for its organic increase. The essence is for existence, and the growth is for increase. A child is organic, something of life, and its beginning is at birth. Following birth, every child&rsquo;s greatest need is growth. The church is also something organic, full of life. It is not an organization, void of life. We should forget about the common concept of the church as an organization or some social body. It is true that the church is a corporate entity, but it is not something organized. It is something born.</p>
<p>The Bible calls this birth regeneration. Paul was regenerated over nineteen hundred years ago, and I was regenerated just about sixty-four years ago. Everyone who believes in the Lord was regenerated at some point in time. However, in God&rsquo;s sight we all were regenerated at the same time. First Peter 1:3 says, &ldquo;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead.&rdquo; This is a crucial verse. It tells us God <em>has</em> regenerated all His chosen people. We were not regenerated separately. According to 1 Peter 1:3 we all were regenerated at the time the Lord Jesus was resurrected. We have been regenerated <em>through</em> His resurrection.</p>
<p>All the countless believers, regardless of how many millions there are, are as one man in the sight of God. This universal man is the new man (Eph. 2:15). The Head of this new man is Christ, and the Body of this new man is the church. The church is the Body of Christ. This is not the individual Christ, but the corporate Christ, the enlarged Christ.</p>
