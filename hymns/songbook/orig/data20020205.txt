Sometimes Lord, I'm drawn off by my selfish cares;
And the world it draws me with glitter and glare.

Kiss me and woo me, and win my heart,

Keep my heart so soft, Lord, so open to You;
It would be the good ground to bear fruit for You;
Capture my friends, Lord, and build us, I pray;

We're the virgins to You,
So single and true;

There's a gospel of today

	That says believe and you'll be saved, and then

You can go to heaven and see the pearly gates

All the vanity---that is hidden in me.

But the gospel is to me
	The Triune God within humanity
As the Spirit reaching me to be in me
	The One reality.
Love untold---Gospel Thee
Never getting old---story told eternally.

#
Left the ninety-nine behind---
	You searched until the lost sheep You did find
Laid me on Your shoulders there, You bore me in
	Your tender loving care.
Rejoicing---You found me,
Though a small lost sheep---You gave all to come find me.

#
Sweeping in my deepest parts,
	You lit a lamp and searched my inward heart,
Sanctifying deep within You shined in me,
	exposed me of my sin.
Repenting---now I see
Lord, You're sprinkling me---with the blood You shed for me.

#
Eagerly awaiting me
	that I the slightest turn to Thee would make.
Though my life had been a wreck, You ran to me
	And fell upon my neck.
Kissing me, affectionately,
Killed the calf for me---``Let us eat and be merry.''

Visions of rapture now burst on my sight;
Angels descending, bring from above
Echoes of mercy,  whispers of love.

I in my Savior am happy and blessed;
Watching and waiting, looking above,
Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.

I have a Friend, whose faithful love

Is more than all the world to me;

#
He held the highest place above,
Adored by all the sons of flame,
Yet such His self-denying love,
He laid aside His crown and came
	To seek the lost,
	And at the cost
Of heavenly rank and earthly fame
He sought me---Blessed be His name!

#
It was a lonely path He trod,
From every human soul apart;
Known only to Himself and God
Was all the grief that filled His heart,
	Yet from the track
	He turned not back,
Till where I lay in want and shame,
He found me---Blessed be His name!

#
Then dawned at last that day of dread,
When desolate, yet undismayed,
With wearied frame and thorn-crowned head,
He, God-forsaken, man-betrayed,
	Was then made sin
	On Calvary,
And, dying there in grief and shame,
He saved me---Blessed be His name!

#
Long as I live my song shall tell
The wonders of His dying love;
And when at last I go to dwell
With Him His sovereign grace to prove,
	My joy shall be
	His face to see,
And bowing there with loud acclaim
I'll praise Him---Blessed be His name!

 D             G             D-A7
The Church is Christ's own Body,
	     G       A          D
	The Father's dwelling-place,
                      G
The gathering of the called ones,
	      Em     D          A7
	God blended with man's race;
  D           G    D
Elect before creation,
	 Bm                   Em
	Redeemed by Calvary's death,
     D     G       D   A
Her character and standing
	     G      A       D
	Of heaven, not of earth.

#
New man of new creation,
	Born through her risen Lord,
Baptized in God the Spirit,
	Made holy by His Word;
Christ is her life and content,
	Himself her glorious Head;
She has ascended with Him
	O'er all her foes to tread.

#
Christ is her one foundation,
	None other man may lay; 
All that she has, as Christ, is
	Divine in every way;
Her members through the Spirit
	Their death on Calv'ry own;
They're built in resurrection---
	Gold, silver, precious stone.

#
One God, one Lord, one Spirit---
	Her elements all one---
One faith, one hope, one baptism,
	One Body in the Son;
The Triune God is in her,
	One Body members own,
By faith they are united,
	In hope of glory shown.

#
From every tribe and nation
	Do all the members come,
Regardless of their classes
	United to be one.
No high there is, nor lowly,
	No Jew, nor Gentile clan,
No free, nor slave, nor master,
	But Christ, the ``one new man.''

#
One Body universal,
	One in each place expressed;
Locality of dwelling
	Her only ground possessed;
Administration local,
	each answ'ring to the Lord;
Communion universal,
	Upheld in one accord.

#
Her local gatherings model
	The New Jerusalem;
Its aspects and its details
	Must show in all of them.
Christ is the Lamp that shineth,
	With God within, the Light;
They are the lampstands bearing
	His glorious Image bright.

Crowns and thrones may perish,
	Kingdoms rise and wane;
But the Church of Jesus
	Constant will remain.
Gates of hell can never
	'Gainst the Church prevail;
We have Christ's own promise,
	Which can never fail.

Onward, then, ye people!
	Join our happy throng;
Blend with ours your voices
	In the triumph song.
Glory, laud and honor
	Unto Christ, the King;
This through countless ages
	Men and angels sing.

On His bosom rest
Bids thee still, with love as tender.
Lean upon His breast.

He who'mid the raging billows
Walked upon the sea
Still can hush our wildest tempest.
As on Galilee:
He who wept and prayed in anguish
In Gethsemane
Drinks with us each cup of trembling.

As of old He walked to Emmaus.
With them to abide.
So through all life's way He walketh.
Ever near our side:
Soon again shall we behold Him---
Hasten, Lord, the day!
But 'twill still be ``this same Jesus.''

#
Aren't you satisfied and thankful
	That our Lord has brought you in
Where His pleasures and His riches flow so free?
	So be happy and be joyful, in the spirit feast on Him, 
	So God's garden can bear fruit abundantly.

Living for Jesus a life that is true,
Striving to please Him in all that I do;
Yielding allegiance, glad-hearted and free,
This is the pathway of blessing for me.

>
O Jesus Lord and Savior,
I give myself to Thee,
For Thou in Thy redemption,
Didst give Thyself for me;
I own no other Master,
My heart shall be Thy throne,
My life I give, henceforth to live, 
O Christ, for Thee alone.

#
Living for Jesus who died in my place,
Bearing on Calv'ry my sin and disgrace;
Such love constrains me to answer His call,
Follow His leading and give Him my all. 

#
Living for Jesus wherever I am,
Doing each duty in His holy name;
Willing to suffer affliction and loss,
Deeming each trial a part of my cross.

#
Living for Jesus through earth's little while,
My dearest treasure, the light of His smile;
Seeking the lost ones He died to redeem,
Bringing the weary to find rest in Him.

I can't flee from Your presence, You're inside me.
I've climbed the steep mountains, but You still are there,
Descend to the valleys but You find me.

#
Now I see, there's something more to this pattern:
You want to show me all that You are.
So You've drawn me from this strife, into the family life.
As one, our prayers can match Your deep desires.
Now behold we follow You together!

I always knew deep down in me

There was a longing to be free,

There were a lot of things I had;

Some things were good,

Some things were bad.

Gained nothing but the cross.

And for Him suffer loss.

Today I'll patient be.

With the saints it's easy to be bold,
To pursue this life, to gain it, to lay hold.
All the other things we find,
Must be quickly left behind,
So that only life remains for us to see.

Deeper, Lord our turn must be to You;
We would move by life in everything we do;
All our concepts refute,
For Your life be absolute---
Grant us grace to turn much deeper day by day.
When we touch our spirit---such a thrill!
This is far beyond emotion, mind, and will---
It's within our hidden part---
Come, make home in all our heart;
Let Your presence flow as rivers deep within.

Once I was an empty man,
                      Dm - F
My destiny in my own hand,
                             Bb   F
Not knowing what my life was reaping.
                               Bb F
Sometimes I smiled but inside weeping.
          Bb                      F
And this emptiness inside still remained.
            Dm - F
No peace I gained.
           C      Dm
Just emptiness inside me.

#
Even though I knew no way
To help myself or even pray,
Something deep within was seeking,
To know if life on earth had meaning;
And then I found the answer in a name.
I'm not the same,
Since I have called on Jesus.

#
This Jesus lives inside of me---
My Lord, my life, my all to be.
This life and peace inside increases
By calling on the name of Jesus.
There's nothing for my soul on earth to seek.
I have no need;
I'm satisfied in Jesus.

Because He has come and filled me

But there is another tree to see;

From the tree of good and evil to depart;
Nevermore entangled there;
Flee unto the life-tree where
Right and wrong does not become our great concern.

And become so free and happy
There enjoying You as life abundantly.

Eating of the tree of life forevermore!

If you wish to let Him in, you just call upon His name,

'Cause nothing else will do.

Increase Thyself in us each day
And the ``self''---decrease it 'til it's done away.

We don't want all the strife.

Two spirits mingled into one
Day by day, walk in the spirit and we've won!

For my Christ is rising up to water you.

Should a pause come, or the meeting ebb real low,
While within me there's a rich and living flow,
Then I'll stand up, so that all the saints will know,
That I'm here to share my Christ and water you.

In the church life, in our daily living too,
In the meeting, and in everything we do,
Christ is speaking and the Spirit's breaking through,
That is why there's the supply to water you.

The Bible is a romance
    G             D
In the most holy sense:
                    Bm
God and His chosen people
    Em            A
In love it so presents.
     Em  G      D
This Universal Couple
       G       D      A
Throughout it is displayed;
  Bm                  G
God in Christ is the Bridegroom,
                 A          D
His saints, the Bride, portrayed.

#
Through shadows, types, and figures,
God's deepest thought is known;
As typified by Adam,
The Husband, Christ, is shown.
A rib brought forth from Adam
Reveals the source of life
By which God built a woman:
Eve, as the church, His wife.

#
To be His people's Husband,
To take them as His wife:
This is what God desires
To live in marriage life.
Their sacrifice and worship
Alone could not content;
But with them to be married
Was God's foremost intent.

#
This romance is the finest
As seen in the Song of Songs;
For her beloved's kisses
His seeking lover longs.
Love's work in her produces
No person of her own,
But she becomes the City,
Her Person, Christ Alone.

#
Christ is our coming Bridegroom;
We are the Church His Bride,
Redeemed, regenerated,
The issue of His side,
In source, in life, in nature
And person fully one,
His counterpart forever,
The New Jerusalem.

	A vessel to contain just Him.

#
Deep within you is your spirit,
Even deeper than your ``heart'';
Many other things can fill you---
Only Jesus can fill this part.
	You have been so empty all these years;
	In spite of all you've tried, you're still not satisfied.
	Don't you feel a longing deep within
	To open up and take Christ in?

#
Doesn't matter how you see things,
For in God's eyes ``all have sinned'';
Jesus shed His blood to cleanse you
For the purpose of getting in.
	He's done everything there is to do,
	And He's the Spirit now so He can get in you.
	Makes no difference what your past has been;
	The living Christ will still come in.

#
Just as you are in your body,
Perfectly contained therein,
God wants you for His container,
All you need to do is let Him in.
	Would you open up from deep within
	To let the Lord come in and fill you to the brim.
	Why not open up from deep within
	And call upon the name of Him.

He's got too many now, it's plain to see;
All He wants is One New Man forever,

The only way that we'll be one is Jesus!
The only way for Him to gather us,
Is by our EATING, DRINKING, BREATHING JESUS!
Until His riches overflow in us!

The Lord has put me in the church life,

In first John 5, it's plain to see,
If I have the Son I have life in me.
He did come that we might have life,
And have it more abundantly.
In Him was life,
And the life was the light of men,
Only the life of God is life,
God's life will never end.
You see, ``I AM that I AM''
Is the life that has no end,
Any other so-called life
Must always die, my friend.
Life divine for all time,
In it only God we find.
He's the source and the substance
Of this new life of mine!

#
God flowed out Himself to earth,
Hence we have the Christ child's birth.
Then He flowed out once again,
From the pierced side of Him.
Once the rock is so struck,
Out the waters flow,
Now this life is poured out,
And it's God that we know.
For it is life, life, life,
That is flowing from the throne.
The lamb of God is seated there
To flow out to His own.
Life is God as a flow,
Reaching all of us to grow,
Firstfruits for the Master's table,
This is the life we must know.

I ask Thee for a thoughtful love, through constant watching wise,
To meet the glad with joyful smiles, to wipe the weeping eyes
A heart at leisure from itself, to soothe and sympathize.

I would not have the restless will that hurries to and fro,
Seeking for some great thing to do or secret thing to know;
I would be treated as a child, and guided where I go.

Wherever in the world I am, in whatso'er estate,
I have a fellowship with hearts to keep and cultivate;
A work of lowly love to do for Him on whom I wait.

I ask Thee for the daily strength, to none that ask denied,
A mind to blend with outward life while keeping at Thy side;
Content to fill a little space, if Thou be glorified.

#
And if some things I do not ask my cup of blessing be,
I'd have my spirit filled the more with grateful love to Thee,
More careful, not to serve Thee much, but please Thee perfectly.

#
The briers besetting every path, they call for patient care;
There is a cross in every lot, an earnest need for prayer;
A lowly heart that leans on Thee is happy anywhere.

#
In service which Thy will appoints there are no bonds for me;
My inmost heart is taught ``the truth'' that makes Thy children ``free''
A life of self-renouncing love, a life of liberty.

It's a new, living meeting that we're having today.
       G           D            E7           A7
We are meeting in spirit and we worship this way.
     D                            G
We enjoy the reality of Christ as all,
                      D              A7        D
And leave all of the shadows when on Jesus we call.

It's a new, living meeting

In a new, living way.

At the beaches, the schools, the parks---
	    E7       A7
	wherever we may.
        D                        D7       G
We are slaying the ord'nances, religion too.
                  D            A7
Hallelujah!  The Spirit of the Lord's
	            D 
	breaking through.

#
We don't care for religion, we don't care for the forms,
We don't care for opinions, regulations or norms.
We don't care for the doctrines that will kill us dead---
Hallelujah! We're free in our spirit instead.

#
It's a new, living meeting, no more oldness we'll bear.
In the singing, pray-reading it is Christ that we share.
No more old-fashioned meeting in the old, old way.
Hallelujah! The Lord is doing new things today!

So love and just gain Him!

The allurement of riches, 
     G         A           D
The tinsel of fame cannot make me
         G       A
These illusions claim;
        G          D
On the cross I was dead
      G              A
To Satan, world and sin,
         D
Now I'm living for Jesus,
A           D
Solely for Him.
      D
I've given my life
       G           A
And my all to the Lord,
       D
Loving Him, following Him,
        G    A
Serving Him more;
   G       D             G
Imparting Christ to the poor souls
             A
Living in strife,
         D
Building up with all saints
        A      D
His glorious Bride.

#
In the midst of the world, 
I would no longer roam,
For I've found the Church,
My home sweet home;
Where I with the saints
Feed together on the Lord
'Tis the place where I find life
So real and good.
I've given my life
And my all to the Church;
Loving Her, following Her,
Living for Her,
Together with all saints
Are built as God's delight;
Waiting for Him to come         
For His glorious Bride.

But I never really touched Him quite like this before;

Somehow, suddenly,

What a Christ I see---

All the cares of earth, They don't bother me,
For I've found the living, loving One reality.
Let the world go by,
Just as long as I
Can be here in the church loving Him.

Oh, Jesus, wonderful Jesus,
What a Lord You are to me!
Oh, how I love You, Lord Jesus;
Just to touch Yourself is more than ecstasy!

And kill the fatted calf

The world is longing, seeking for peace,

Yet wars and rumors of wars still increase.

We are dwelling in the love of the Lord,
He our unity has now restored.
Brothers, sisters, in one family,
As the Father and the Son, always one,
So are we!

How good and pleasant it can be
When brothers dwell in unity;
Like sweet anointing and the mountain dew,
Life eternal for me and for you---
All things are new!

	To love Him is the indispensable requirement.

#<
To love God means to set our entire being
Spirit, soul and body absolutely on Him;
To let our entire being be occupied and lost in Him
So that He becomes everything to us.
And we are one with Him practically
In our daily life,
	in this way we have the closest and most intimate
	        Fellowship with God,
	it is thus we are able to enter into His heart
	And apprehend all its secrets.

#<
Thus we not only realize
But also experience and enjoy and fully participate
In these deep and hidden things of God
Which eye has not seen, and ear has not heard,
	And which have not come up in man's heart.
How much God has prepared for those who love Him.

And a smile on my face as I sing,
Oh! I've got rivers of life

Lord Jesus, show me Youre real.
D           F#m             G   A
I couldnt doubt Your love for me.
         G         A
	You are my everything, Lord.
	 G              A 
	Righteousness, peace, and my joy;
	 G         A               D
	How did I have a heart so cold?

#
I gave myself to this world
And kept You far from my heart
	Thought I was missing something
	Thought I was losing something
	Thought I needed much more than You.

#
It took me so long to see
You have desires and a need
	My heart is so unyielding;
	Why am I so self-seeking?
	Burn me Lord, take my life for You.

#
Lord Jesus, show me Youre real
I know Im likely to fall
	But I am wholly cleansed now
	You gave Your life for me; and
	Everything I am is just You.

#
Lord Jesus, I know Youre real
Just turn my face to Your face 
	And all doubts fly away, Lord, 
	Your wants are my desires and 
	All I can say is I love You.

God has called us for His purpose,
His economy so glorious,
For which He was fully processed;
Consummated now is He.
As the Spirit He indwells us
As our God-allotted portion.
Working out His full salvation,
Making us the same as He is.

>
Oh, may a clear controlling vision of
The Lords economy direct my heart
And burn in me until my spirits wholly set afire
With spirit strong and active we'll press on
To consummate Gods goal...
New Jerusalem!  Hallelujah!

#
Jesus lived the God-man pattern,
Set the way for us to follow,
He denied His natural man and
Was obedient unto death.
Once He was the only God-man;
Now we are His duplication,
As the many grains were blended
As His corporate reproduction.

#
Living out His resurrection
Dying to the flesh and soul-life,
Living by the mingled spint,
Natural man we will deny.
Now were living in the Body,
Every day were overcoming,
Striving for the peak of Zion,
Watching for our Lords appearing.

#
God and men will have one living
Always in the mingled spirit;
We two are incorporated---
One organic entity!
This the vision of the ages
Will control our daily living
That the Lord may have His body
Shining as the holy city.

Our Lord, our Life, our Way, our End,

Weak is the effort of our heart,
	And cold our warmest thought;
But when we see Thee as Thou art,
	Well praise Thee as we ought.

Till then we would Thy love proclaim 
	With every fleeting breath;
And triumph in that blessed Name 
	Which quells the powr of death.

No matter though the cost be oft-times great, 
He knoweth how I best shall reach the mark,

One thing I do, I press towards my Lord; 
My God my glory here, from day to day, 
And in the glory there my great Reward.

Who then will forward go
	Strong in His mighty power?
Who then will firmly trust the Lord

Though deep the darkness be
	We still would onward go,
Till we the day of rapture greet 
	And glory round shall glow.

	To be my strength and stay.

I need Thee, precious Jesus!

A friend to soothe and comfort,
	A friend to care for me:
I need the heart of Jesus,
	To feel each anxious care,
To hear my every burden,
	And all my sorrow share.

#
I need Thee, precious Jesus!
	I need Thee day by day,
To fill me with Thy fulness,
	To lead me on my way;
I need Thy Holy Spirit,
	To teach me what I am;
To show me more of Jesus,
	To point me to the Lamb.

#
I need Thee, precious Jesus! 
	And hope to see Thee soon, 
Encircled with Thy glory,
	And seated on Thy throne;
There with Thy blood-bought people, 
	My joy shall ever be
To praise Thee, precious Jesus, 
	To gaze, my Lord, on Thee.

Out of the angry waves.

Of the Spirit, born of Spirit---
	This the source of Jesus is.
Filled with Spirit, all of Spirit---
	This the essence truly His.
In the Spirit, with the Spirit,
	As the Spirit Jesus came;
Now the Lord is just that Spirit
	And in spirit were the same.

# 
Baptized in the Holy Spirit,
	In the Spirit were immersed;
All the church is born of Spirit,
	All religion is dispersed.
In the Spirit, in the Spirit---
	Brothers, this is all we need.
Now the church must be in Spirit, 
	Not in teaching, form, or creed.

#
The communion of the Spirit
	Is the fellowship we share;
All the brothers, all the sisters
	Only for the Spirit care.
Now the Spirit in the churches
	Speaks to those who have an ear
Seven Spirits for the churches
	Are our blessed portion here.

#
``Come and drink the living water,'' 
	Say the Spirit and the Bride---
Church and Spirit speak together,
	Utterly identified.
Just according to the Spirit 
	Must be our reality; 
Just the Spirit in the churches 
	Is the Lords recovery.

We will sing to the Lord with our spirit, 
We will sing to the Lord from within, 
We will sing hallelujah to Jesus; 
And be blent into oneness with Him.

We have been many years in religion, 
We have been many years in our mind 
We have been many years in emotions, 
Always seeking, but never to find.

Now we're learning to turn to our spirit,
Now we're learning to take Christ as life;
Now we're learning to feed upon Jesus
And be freed from all struggling and strife.

#
Hallelujah for life in the Spirit, 
Hallelujah for newness within. 
When we turn from our mind to our spirit, 
We enjoy all the riches of Him.

A mighty flowing-out is God,
He flows throughout the ages.
And so to flow Himself to man
He is in many stages;
Yet still one God is He,
One flow eternally;
His stages pave the way
To flow through man today,
And now He flows within us!

#
In the beginning we can see,
God as a flowing river,
The river to convey the tree,
Himself as life deliver.
And at the end the same,
The river doth remain,
God in the Lamb doth flow,
The tree prevails to grow,
And God flows on forever.

#
God flowed Himself into a man,
The man we call Christ Jesus.
He gave up His own life for man
And Gods own life releases.
Though Satan did his best
To put Gods flow to rest---
He had Him crucified
And cruelly pierced His side---
But out came blood and water!

#
The blood and water flowed from Him,
In streams of pure salvation.
The blood brings cleansing from all sin;
Water, regeneration.
And now the Spirit flows,
Brings God whereer He goes.
All he could do, the foe,
Was just release the flow.
And God just keeps on flowing.

Oh, what a blessed word!

A mutual abode.

There's nothing that we are
Or have or do well-pleasing;

Inwrought into our being.
O Lord, our heart's still vacant now!
Come in and settle down.

And fill us with Yourself.

Our spirit You have filled
At our regeneration,
But mind, emotion, will
Await Your saturation.
How much of You is built in us
To make our heart Your home?
O Triune God, we welcome You.
Come build, oh, build in us.

Into our innermost
Intrinsic constitution,
Come, Lord, Yourself dispense
By constant, fresh infusion;
Transform us, Lord, and work Yourself,
As God's embodiment,
Into our heart, and life each part,
With Your reality.

To build Your house today,
Self-effort You're refusing---
All stubble, wood, and hay;
Gold, silver, gems, you're using.
The consummated Triune God
Transmitted into us
Now builds Himself into a home---
His dwelling, glorious.

Calling is the way to delight oneself in God;
That is to enjoy Him, enjoy the Lord our God.
Hence, we as God's people, must daily call on Him.
This must be our practice for God's jubilee.

Beneath a sunny sky;

He knows how much I love Him,
And if I love Him well;
But with what love He loveth me,
My tongue can never tell;
It is an everlasting love,
Much more as days go by;
And so we love each other,
My Lord and I.

I tell Him all my sorrows,
I tell Him all my joys;
I tell Him all that pleases me,

He tells me what I ought to do,
He tells me how to try;
And so we talk together,
My Lord and I.

He knows my hearts such longing,
Some weary soul to win;
And so He bids me go and speak,
The loving word for Him;
He bids me tell His wondrous love,
And why He came to die;
And so we work together,
My Lord and I.

#
Had I wealth and love in fullest measure,
	And a name revered both far and near,
Yet no hope beyond, no harbor waiting.
	Where my storm-tossed vessel I could steer;
If I gained the world, but lost the Savior,
	Who endured the cross and died for me,
Could then all the world afford a refuge,
	Whither, in my anguish, I might flee?

#
O what emptiness!---without the Savior
	'Mid the sins and sorrows here below!
And eternity, how dark without Him!
	Only night and tears and endless woe!
What, though I might live without the Savior,
	When I come to die, how would it be?
O to face the valley's gloom without Him!
	And without Him all eternity

#
O the joy of having all in Jesus!
	What a balm the broken heart to heal!
Ne'er a sin so great, but He'll forgive it,
	Nor a sorrow that He does not feel!
If I have but Jesus, only Jesus,
	Nothing else in all the world beside---
O then everything is mine in Jesus;
	For my needs and more He will provide.
