   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S GRACE NOT RELATED TO MAN'S ACHIEVEMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now the second issue arises.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Not everything that man does is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In God's eyes, all of man's acts are sins, but in man's eyes, many things he does are achievements.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some consider that since they are such extreme sinners, they cannot receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Others think that because they sin, they have to improve themselves before they can receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Please notice that there is a difference here.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first group says that they have sinned and are therefore unqualified to receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This group is absolutely in the negative realm.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The second group is a little more positive.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They say that they are sinners and will only receive grace if they act better.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They think that they have to attain a certain standard of conduct and certain achievements before they can receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the mind of the first group, the problem is hindrance from grace.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the mind of the second group, the problem is how to obtain grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some think that wrongdoings will hinder us from receiving God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Others think that achievements will enable us to obtain God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Friend, do you know what grace is?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Grace is unconditional.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is free, and it is not given based on any reason.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is God's work of love which He bestows on us, the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If God's grace were related to man's achievements, the nature of grace would immediately be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As long as a trace of achievement is allowed to remain in us, God must reward us according to our achievement.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>And since He is righteous, He is just.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He has to reward and recompense man according to his achievements.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But if God's giving is a recompense or reward, it is not grace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As soon as achievements come in, recompense must also come in and grace is out.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If a man gives you a month's labor and you give him a month's wages, the payment cannot be considered a gift; it is a recompense.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He has done something for you; it is his achievement.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If it is an achievement, the payment is not grace, but recompense.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once recompense comes in, grace goes out.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Romans 4:4 makes the matter very clear: "Now to the one who works, his wages are not accounted according to grace, but according to what is due."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Wrongdoings do not stop us from receiving grace; on the contrary, they afford us the opportunity to receive God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Achievements do not help us to receive God's grace; on the contrary, they annul the nature of God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Unless it is free, it is not grace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Unless it is given without reason and cause and unless it is a gift, it is not grace.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If there is some reason or some cause involved, if there is a price involved, or if there is some work involved, the matter of recompense immediately comes in because God is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once recompense comes in, the nature of grace is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you are standing on a position that is above God, or even one that is equal with God, you cannot receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That is why Romans 4 says clearly that no one can come before God and say that he has done this or that and, therefore, unashamedly ask for grace.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If a person says that he is not like others who have extorted money or who are so unrighteous, that he fasts at least twice a week, that even though he may not have tithed, he at least offered up one-twentieth of what he has, he cannot receive God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What is grace?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Let me say this in an emphatic way grace is receiving without having a reason to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once there is a reason, it becomes recompense.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you have any achievements, the matter of recompense comes in and grace is out.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must pay much attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is still another sentence in Romans which is very clear on this point: "But if by grace, it is no longer out of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace" 11:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Someone in my family once said that we should give a gift to a certain doctor at the end of the year.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When I asked why, I was told that two months earlier my two younger brothers were sick, and they were cared for by that doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because the doctor was a friend, he would not accept any money for his services.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, we were to buy him something.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>"In that case," I said, "we are not giving him something, but returning something."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because there was a work and a debt.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Strictly speaking, our giving was a returning of what we owed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>My friends, if we had any achievements before God, whether these achievements were great or small, God's salvation to us would become a payment of debt and would no longer be grace.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thank God that there is no one who can claim any achievements before God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Thank the Lord that we are saved by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If I, Watchman Nee, were saved by my achievements, I would never say, "God, I thank You for giving me grace."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Instead I would say, "God, I am saved because You have paid back Your debt."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I could proudly claim that I am saved by achievements.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Why is it that no one can save himself by achievements?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is because God wants to remove all pride from man, that man may do nothing other than thank and praise Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Once the matter of achievements arises, grace is no longer grace.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Please remember that God cannot withhold grace from man because of his wrongdoings.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Nor can He reduce His grace to man because of his wrongdoings.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He has to give, and He cannot reduce His giving.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Grace is not related to wrongdoings.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What about achievements?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In grace there is no possibility of mixture with anything, even in the nature of achievements.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Grace is not God's payment of debt to us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is not that God owed us and that now He is paying us back.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Some may say, "Mr. Nee, we are not so extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Even though we dare not say that we come to God only by our achievements, you have to believe that we need some achievements before God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is impossible to have nothing at all.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We should do a little work, and then God can make up our lack.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We will do our best, and God will make up the rest."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>My friends, we cannot say this.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Grace is not God's payment of a debt.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In the same way, neither is grace God's overpayment of a debt, as if God owed you five dollars, but is now returning ten to you.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Grace is like someone giving you a new garment.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is not like someone patching up your torn garment.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If grace is a patching up, it has lost its standing, and its nature is annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Let me repeat again, grace has nothing to do with achievements.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Man naturally sees that some people are better and others are worse.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Therefore, he thinks that the better ones require less of God's grace and the worse ones require more of God's grace a bigger patch for a bigger hole and a smaller patch for a smaller hole.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But such a concept does not exist in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Who has sinned?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I believe all of us know the phrase by heart: "For all have sinned."</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Why is it that all have sinned?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>It is because they "fall short of the glory of God" Rom 3:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If the Bible were to say that all have sinned because all have broken the Ten Commandments, there would be a difference between great sinners and small sinners, for some may have transgressed nine commandments, while others may have transgressed only one.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If the Bible were to say that all have sinned because all have fallen short of society's customs or the law of the land, there would still be some who are good and some who are not so good.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>But strangely enough, the Bible says that all have sinned because all have fallen short of the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>What then is the glory of God?</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If you want to understand what the glory of God is, you have to understand Romans 1 through 8.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>God's grace is linked to God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Grace seeks out man on the lowest level, and glory brings man to the highest level.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Romans 1 through 3 tells us how man has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Then after giving the way of salvation by the Lord Jesus in chapters three through five, the crucifixion with Christ in chapters six and seven, and the work of the Holy Spirit at the beginning of chapter eight, Romans tells us the following at the end of chapter eight, "Whom He foreknew, He also predestinated...whom He predestinated, these He also called; and those whom He called, these He also justified; and those whom He justified, these He also glorified" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Salvation is God pulling a sinner from the mud of sin and taking him all the way to glory.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Although we are justified, we know that justification is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Justification is not the goal of God's salvation for us.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>God will not stop until we are in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Hence, Romans 1 through 8 begins with sins and ends with glory.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>What does it mean to fall short of the glory of God?</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>It means that one cannot enter into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>All have sinned because they cannot enter into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>If all have sinned because they have not honored their parents, you could find some "great" dishonoring ones, some "mild" dishonoring ones, and some "little" dishonoring ones.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Perhaps for the 400 million Chinese, there are 400 million classes of dishonoring ones.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>But in falling short of the glory of God, that is, in failing to enter into glory, you and I are exactly the same.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>You may be a moralist, and I may be a criminal.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>As a criminal I cannot enter into glory, but neither can you as a moralist.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Hence, before God all have fallen short of His glory, and no one is qualified to enter in.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>You can go to the street and tell anyone that he has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>If he says that he has not sinned, you can ask if he thinks he can enter into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Of course, he will not know what glory is.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>If we are in God's light, and if we have a little knowledge of the Scripture, we will know that we are not qualified to enter in. None of us can enter in.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Two months ago, while I was in Hong Kong, the world tennis championship was there.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>The tennis pavilion where the match was held could hold only five to six hundred spectators.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Another eight hundred people could not get in and had to stand outside.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>The problem was not whether they had money or not, whether they were male or female, or whether they were masters or slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>None of them could go in. Whether one was rich or poor, educated or illiterate, male or female, made no difference.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>The difference between them and those inside did not lie in their being rich or poor, male or female, educated or illiterate.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>The problem was that they could not get in.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>In the same way, whether or not you are moral or whether or not you are gentle is not the question.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>The question is whether or not you can enter into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>All those who cannot enter into glory are sinners and are disqualified before God.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>God has leveled everyone before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>We have a plot of land in Jen-ru.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Recently we needed to put some grass on it.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>To do that I had to hire some workers to level the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>The question today is whether or not we can enter in. Regardless of whether or not you are moral, you cannot enter into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>God has leveled everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>Why has God leveled everyone?</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>Galatians 3:22 tells us that "the Scripture has shut up all under sin in order that the promise out of faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe."</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>God has shut up all under sin.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>Everyone has become a sinner, so that all who believe in Jesus Christ may receive the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>God has leveled everyone so that He might bestow grace on everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>Romans 11:32 says, "For God has shut up all in disobedience that He might show mercy to all."</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>God has shut up all in disobedience.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>He has leveled them all.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>For what goal?</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>The goal is that He might show mercy to all.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>Hence, before God achievements can have no place at all.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>Everyone stands on the same ground.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>Romans 3:9 says, "What then?</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>Are we better?</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>Not at all!</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>For we have previously charged both Jews and Greeks that they are all under sin."</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>God's verdict is that both the Jews and the Gentiles are all under sin.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>There is absolutely no chance for achievements to have a place.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>In the portions of the Scriptures that we have just read, we see that all have been shut up in sin and disobedience in order that we may go to God to receive grace and mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>What is God's grace?</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>God's grace is His giving to man not according to what he deserves.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>God's grace does not give to man more than what he deserves or better than what he deserves.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>Grace is simply God giving to man what he should not have and does not deserve.</S>
