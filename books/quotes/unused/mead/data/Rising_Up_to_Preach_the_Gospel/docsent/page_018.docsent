   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WIND, THE CLOUD, THE FIRE, AND THE ELECTRUM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The chorus of the Chinese Hymns, #212 says,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Blowing!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Blowing!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Holy Spirit, the great wind, blowing!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Covering!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Covering!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Spirit, the great cloud, covering!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Burning!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Burning!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The holy fire burning!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Glowing!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Glowing!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God s electrum glowing!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum are the content of chapter one of Ezekiel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 1961 I had a study with the church in Taipei on the book of Ezekiel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I gave many messages just on chapter one alone.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Ezekiel begins with a storm wind from the north God s dwelling place .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The wind brings a great cloud, and as the cloud covers, the fire begins to burn.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then once the fire burns, the electrum begins to appear.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This section of the Old Testament is a prophecy with a type.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Spirit we have received today is a great wind, a great cloud, and a great fire, and within there is also the electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, when we receive the Spirit today, we become people who are always of wind, cloud, and fire.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These three things wind, cloud, and fire are constantly creating events in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whenever wind and clouds are stirred up in the world s political situation, war breaks out and fire begins to burn.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, the fire s burning always brings out something good the electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, do not be afraid of war.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>History proves that whenever there is war, the electrum is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the doing of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the situation is suitable and the opportunity comes, He will blow the wind from the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the wind blows, the cloud follows.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then there is shaking in the world situation: war breaks out and fire is burning everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After the burning, the electrum is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is what is meant by the Chinese proverb: When the snipe and the clam fight, they both become captives of the fisherman.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord Jesus is the fisherman who captures much electrum as a result of wars.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In 1950 the church in Hong Kong was considering to buy a piece of land in Tsim Sha Tsui to build a meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At that time, Brother Watchman Nee first helped to form a group to carry out acquisition and construction and then charged the brothers, saying, Whatever Brother Witness tells you concerning the land, listen to him and quickly buy it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The brothers then took me to see the land.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At that time it was still a vegetable garden.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When I saw it, I said that Tsim Sha Tsui would become the center of Hong Kong and Kowloon because it is conveniently located near the ferry.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, we bought the land in a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It was just as I had predicted.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the brothers asked me how much land they should buy, I said they should buy at least twelve thousand square feet.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The brothers lost faith when they heard this, because the total cost of the land was approximately fifty thousand U. S. dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>That amount is insignificant at the present time, but at that time it was exceedingly high.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because of this, they asked me if they could reduce the purchase by one-half.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I laughed and said, This is your business; do not ask me for a reduction.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Still, I have to say that if you do not buy it now, you will regret it later, and when you do want to buy it, you will not be able to.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They thought they had my approval, so they went and bought six thousand square feet.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Once they started to build, however, they realized that they had bought too small a portion of land.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, they went back to buy more but were able to buy only another three thousand square feet.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I relate this story to illustrate that the world situation is ever changing to produce the electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, the Lord will not gather the electrum Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He wants us to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we hesitate and delay, we will suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have been blown to America by the great wind.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some may have thought that they came just to study for a degree or to make a business investment.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It never occurred to them that they would settle here permanently.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This was their view; it was not the Lord s view.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He sent us here by the wind and carried us here by the cloud.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He did this so that we could preach the gospel here to gain the electrum!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>ENJOYING THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT AS OUR POWER</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Let us not listen to what Christianity teaches nor care for what Pentecostalism practices.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We need to come back to the Bible itself.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The New Testament clearly reveals that this One who became flesh, passed through human living, entered into death, was buried, resurrected, ascended, descended, and became the life-giving Spirit is the mysterious and marvelous One.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He is our Lord, our God, our Redeemer, and our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Moreover, He is the Spirit of life and the Spirit of power.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He is the wonderful One.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Today the electrum is in the Spirit, and the Lord is this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This Spirit passed through the breathing in John 20 and the blowing in Acts 2 to be the complete Spirit with both divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Today you and I are saved; we have received the complete Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There is no need for us to experience the process of the breathing and the blowing.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>However, the problem lies in that even though we have the Spirit, we may not enjoy or experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Children who are foolish and lazy do not eat good food when it is available and do not put on good shoes when they have them.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>What we have received today is the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He has immeasurable riches, so we must enjoy Him.</S>
