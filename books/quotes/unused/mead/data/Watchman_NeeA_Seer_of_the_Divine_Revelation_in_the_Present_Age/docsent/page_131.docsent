   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>F. The Open Door</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because of the Japanese invasion in July 1937, many saints and co-workers in the Lord's recovery were forced to move to the interior of China from the coastal provinces.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Watchman was burdened to publish The Open Door, not as an official publication, but as part of his personal ministry to serve the scattered saints.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The open letter published in the first issue in September 1937 unveiled to us his purpose in publishing this paper:</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>An Open Letter</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>September 19, 1937</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To all the brothers who are partakers</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>of the gracious calling:</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For years I have felt the need of a publication which could be used to communicate news of the work in all of the localities.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A local newsletter belongs to a particular locality and serves a particular church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But we need a paper for the intercommunication of news which will serve all the localities, that is, one which will serve the work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The name, The Open Door, was chosen much earlier, and I had hoped that others would be raised up by the Lord to bear its responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This was my hope because, on the one hand, there is the need, and, on the other hand, my special stand makes it impossible for me to undertake the task myself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If this had been undertaken by someone else, it would have been merely personal and done by someone who was gifted to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But if I were to do it, it would become official and would be based on my position.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, in order to avoid this, I dared not move for years.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I never believed that this newspaper would be issued under this kind of circumstance, at this time, and in this place.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now I must do what I did not wish to do.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, please keep in mind always, brothers, that this is a personal ministry and not the instrument of an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If any co-worker or church in any locality is unwilling to see their news appear in this publication, please say so in order that none might be offended in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But I do wish that I could receive news from all the localities so that those who are concerned for you could make intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The original intention of my recent trip was to go on to England and America.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I did not know why, but I kept being delayed on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After spending ten weeks in Southeast Asia, I still had not entered the Indian Ocean.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>While at Penang, I felt the Lord wanted me to return to take care of some work before proceeding on to England.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The emphasis of The Open Door is the gospel work in all the localities.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It seems that now is the time that the door for preaching the Word is open the widest, and we pray that God would cause us to make use of this opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this publication we will print:</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>1 Articles concerning the principles of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>2 News of gospel preaching in all the localities.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>3 The addresses of the workers the apostles on the move.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>4 The addresses of the meeting halls of the local churches in order that the brothers who are escaping the war might know where to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>5 The whereabouts of the brothers the disciples in the Lord at every place in order that comfort might be given those who are concerned for them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are now temporarily publishing at Gospel Court, Lane 1, Hsiao-Dong-Jia, Hankow.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the future we may move to Ch'ang-sha, though this is difficult to predict.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our correspondence address remains at Hankow until further notice.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is still one further matter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because the itinerary of the co-workers in the various places is continually changing, it presents a problem to those who wish to write them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We wish to serve the brothers in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Anyone wishing us to forward their mail may send it to the above address, and it will be taken care of accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This publication is not for sale.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We trust in God for the supply of its need.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Peace be unto you.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Your brother,</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
