<h1 class="title">CONCERNING THE GOSPEL IN SCHOOLS</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<p>There are many practical needs in leading the gospel work in schools. We therefore may not be able to cover everything thoroughly in a few messages. What we have fellowshipped, in principle, is based on many years of observation. When we begin the work, there will be many more things that we will need to learn.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEGINNING WITH THE BASICS AND BEGINNING SMALL</h2>
<p>Some saints have proposed that we set up a student club on the college campuses and put out a publication. In order to succeed in any endeavor, we need to begin with the basics. This is a general principle. The way to succeed is to begin with the basics and to begin small. Any endeavor that does not begin with the basics and does not begin small will fail sooner or later, because there is no foundation. An endeavor that does not start small may appear to be doing well, but as soon as difficulties come, nothing will remain. In whatever we do, we need to begin with a base and then continue from the base.</p>
<p>Concerning setting up a club on campus or putting out a publication for the truth, we cannot say that this is not good or that it will not have any effect. A club or a publication can be used only to create an atmosphere for change. For example, Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, the founder of the Republic of China, made contacts in China and outside of China in preparation for a revolution. He made contacts with people in China, Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, and America, gaining a group of comrades, both young and old, for the revolution. Some of his contacts were older overseas Chinese who were willing to give money for the revolution, and some were young men in the country who were willing to sacrifice their lives. If he had promoted a revolution only outside of China, without having gained a group of people within the country who dedicated their lives to the cause, the revolution would not have succeeded. This example shows that the most important point in our gospel work is to contact people one by one. If we spend our time establishing a club or putting out a publication to create an atmosphere, in the end we will have nobody but ourselves even if everyone agrees with what we say.</p>
<p>Therefore, we would rather utilize our time to contact students on the campuses. In half a year we can gain at least a few solid contacts among the freshmen and lead them to contact another two or three students. In this way, in half a year we will gain twelve students, and in another half year we will have forty-eight students. This way is more effective than establishing a student club or putting out a publication. Not only should the gospel work in the schools be done in this way, but in all the other aspects of the work we should take the same way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OPENING HOMES AND GAINING PEOPLE IN FOUR WAYS</h2>
<p>The home of a believer has four main functions. It can be used to preach the gospel to other families, to receive students for the gospel work, to preach the gospel in the community, and for the children&rsquo;s work. In order to have a strong foundation for our gospel work, the brothers and sisters need to open their homes. In the church in Taipei we are promoting small group gatherings. There are about four hundred small groups, and every group has two or three families. It would be a great thing to have one thousand open homes in Taipei preaching the gospel. Opening our homes is a very effective move for the gospel. Every year we can harvest four kinds of crop: from the families, from students, from the community, and from the children&rsquo;s work. The foundation for such a work is the home.</p>
<p>No matter how hard we work, we will encounter problems in the gospel work with the students. As soon as there is a change in the environment, the work will be restricted. However, the gospel work in the homes is unshakable. The homes are always there, whether in rain or in sunshine. The base for receiving the gospel work in the schools is the home, and the home unit is the most stable base. Similarly, the base of the gospel in the community should be in the homes. The home of a brother who is a medical doctor can be used to reach doctors with the gospel. The home of a sister who is a nurse can be used to reach nurses. The home of a brother who is a policeman can be used to reach police officers with the gospel. The home of a brother who is a college professor can be used to gain other professors. Even the home of an older sister can be used for the gospel to gain older people. It may be difficult for old saints to speak with young people, but when older people get together, they enjoy talking because there is no distance among them. Therefore, if an older sister is willing to open her home and invite some older women to her home, their heart will be open, and she will hit the target with the gospel. This also applies to the children&rsquo;s work. We must use the homes as a base.</p>
<p>We should use the homes as the base to promote the work. The home is the most basic unit. When this concept is in our veins, the gospel work will succeed. If every brother and sister opens their home to preach the gospel, even a typhoon with heavy winds and strong rains will not frustrate the gospel. We must take the way of using the homes as the base for our work in the schools. With the homes as the base, there is no problem to set up a club or put out a publication. According to our experience, if our work does not get into the homes, we have no base. Once there is a stable base for the work in the homes, with little effort, whatever we do will achieve maximum result.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 5: Concerning Various Aspects of Church Service &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
