   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GIFTS GIVEN BY THE HEAD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WHO FILLS ALL THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After Christ s ascension, He gave many gifts to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These gifts are a group of people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They are the gifted persons.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Among them there are some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These are people such as Peter and Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They were formerly fallen sinners and sons of Adam, captives who were captured, dominated, and bound by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In spite of their struggling, they had no way of escape.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then one day the Triune God became flesh and entered into these hopeless ones.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He even became one of these hopeless ones and was made one with them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He lived in such a hopeless man for thirty-three and a half years and brought this hopeless man to the cross, terminating the hopeless one.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then He destroyed Satan on the cross and crushed the Devil, even Satan, who has the power of death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After this, He captured these ones from the hands of Satan, and in His resurrection, He resurrected them all and uplifted and transformed these fallen ones.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In His ascension, He led these captives to the heavens and offered them to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Father gave these captives as gifts to the ascended Head who, in His position of ascension, gave in turn these gifts to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the Holy Spirit descended on the day of Pentecost, the Lord gave these people as gifts to the Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The leading one among them was Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From that day on, gifts have been given to the church continually.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One of these gifts was Saul of Tarsus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Formerly, he was one who was against God, against the Lord Jesus, persecuting the churches, and murdering the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>While he was on the way to Damascus to persecute the saints, the Lord, who captured him out of the hand of Satan, appeared to him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Immediately he fell to the ground, and he heard a voice that spoke to him, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He said, Who are You, Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord said, I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting Acts 9:4b-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Saul thought that Jesus was in the grave; he never imagined that Jesus was in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He thought that he was persecuting men on earth; he never realized that he was persecuting the Lord in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That day Paul was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Later the Lord led him away to a quiet place and showed him the revelation concerning God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It became the content of his fourteen Epistles, which are the deepest books of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Tonight we read a portion from Ephesians chapter four.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Had it not been for Paul s seeing, and his writing it down in the Bible, no one would have ever known this matter concerning the ascended Head giving the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Without the revelation and exposition from the Lord, we would not be able to understand this portion even if we were to read it more than a thousand times.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The reason for this is that these words are deep words in God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Triune God became flesh, passed through human living, died on the cross, entered into Hades, and resurrected from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Through this process of descending and ascending, He captured us, the captives of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He put His life into us to regenerate us, and He put His nature into us that our humanity would be uplifted and transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I believe that whether you have been saved for a long time or a short time, you will discover that you are transformed and have been uplifted higher than before.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This does not mean an outward uplifting; rather, it means an uplifting in the inward nature.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This uplifting in nature grows higher and higher day by day until we become the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>ALL BELIEVERS CAN BECOME THE APOSTLES,</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE PROPHETS, THE EVANGELISTS,</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE SHEPHERDS AND TEACHERS</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After we have believed in the Lord Jesus and have been saved, many of us have preached the gospel to others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After we preached the gospel, we began shepherding and teaching in the home meetings and group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we have ever begotten, nourished, and taught, we are the evangelists and the shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A prophet in the sense of the original Greek language is a spokesman of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is one who speaks for God, speaks forth God, and speaks and supplies God into men.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Everyone who speaks for the Lord in this way is a prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I came into the Lord s recovery in 1932.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have been studying this matter of the apostles for over fifty years to find out who are the apostles and what are their qualifications and status.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I received tremendous help from Brother Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Based on our further study the last thirty or so years, we can now say that the light is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Last week at the elders and co-workers training, my first message covered the basic qualifications of an apostle: first, he must have the revelation of God s New Testament economy concerning Christ and the church Matt 16:16-18; Gal 1:11-12, 15-16; Eph 3:3-4, 8-11; 5:32 ; second, he must be able to preach the gospel of Christ and lead the chosen and called sinners to Him Gal 1:16a; Eph 3:8; 2 Cor 11:2 ; third, he must be able to raise up local churches and to appoint elders to lead, shepherd, teach, and oversee these churches Acts 14:23; 1 Tim 5:17; 1 Pet 5:2 ; fourth, he must be able to define doctrines, open up the truth, perfect the saints, and build up the Body of Christ 1 Tim 2:7; Eph 4:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These four items are the works that an apostle should do.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They are also his qualifications to be an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All the brothers and sisters in the Lord s recovery have the possibility of becoming an apostle, a prophet, an evangelist, or a shepherd and teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the reason why we felt that we must change the system during the past four years.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the old system, we listened to messages week after week.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Yet in the end, we were still unable to be the apostles, prophets, shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We were not even able to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When we tried to help a friend or a relative to be saved, we had to bring him to the gospel meeting to listen to a gospel message.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Others had to preach the gospel for us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This was the damage of the old system.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I am so happy that since we began practicing the new system last November, many have learned to preach the gospel, to shepherd, and to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I hope that in two or three years, many of you will become apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There is much hope for this.</S>
