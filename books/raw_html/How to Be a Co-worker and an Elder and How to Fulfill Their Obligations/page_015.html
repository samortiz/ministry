<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. To Become the Life-giving Spirit</H2><P>The second great thing accomplished by Christ in the stage of His inclusion was that He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). In His resurrection, not only was He begotten to be the firstborn Son of God, but also as the last Adam in the flesh He became the life-giving Spirit. Christ's being the last Adam means that after Him there is no more Adam. In Christ, Adam was ended. In resurrection Christ as the last Adam in the flesh became the life-giving Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Last Adam (Christ in the Flesh) Became a Life-giving Spirit</H2><P>First Corinthians 15:45b says, "The last Adam [Christ in the flesh] became a life-giving Spirit." First, in His incarnation, Christ became flesh for accomplishing redemption. Then in His resurrection, Christ, the last Adam, became the life-giving Spirit for dispensing life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. This Life-giving Spirit "Was Not Yet" before the Resurrection of Christ&#151;the Glorification of Christ</H2><P>John 7:39 says, "...for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified." In my youth, when I read this portion of the Word, I wondered why "the Spirit was not yet." Had not the Spirit of God already been there for a long time? Does not Genesis 1:2 say that the Spirit of God was moving upon the face of the waters? Then in the Old Testament, in God's relationship with man, the Spirit of Jehovah is mentioned (Judg. 6:34; Isa. 61:1). At the beginning of the New Testament, in the conception of the Lord Jesus, the Holy Spirit came (Matt. 1:18, 20). The Holy Spirit in Greek is also "the Spirit, the holy." The word holy here indicates that the Spirit can make the common people holy. Therefore, Mary, a common virgin, brought forth a son named Jesus who was called the holy thing (Luke 1:35). Thus, according to the holy Scriptures and the facts, had not the Holy Spirit been there? Why is it that John 7 says that the Spirit was not yet because Jesus had not yet been glorified, that is, had not yet been resurrected?</P><P>After many years of study, I became clear that indeed Jesus was glorified when He was resurrected (Luke 24:26). Before He was resurrected, that is, before He was glorified, the Spirit of God was not the life-giving Spirit. Before the resurrection of Christ, the Spirit of God could move upon the face of the waters, could contact people, and could sanctify people, but He could not impart life into people, because He was not yet the life-giving Spirit. The title the Spirit of life was not mentioned until Romans 8:2. Therefore, prior to the resurrection of Christ, the Spirit was not yet means that there was not yet the life-giving Spirit.</P>
