<p class="bold">WEEK 6 — DAY 4</p><h2 class="uhead1">Scripture Reading</h2><p class="bold">Matt. 18:20 &nbsp;For where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst.</p><p class="bold">Rev. 1:10 &nbsp;I was in spirit on the Lord’s Day…</p><h2 class="head1">The Meeting Life</h2><p>Hebrews 10:25 says, “Not abandoning our own assembling together.”<sup>151</sup> [One characteristic of the life of God we believers have received] is to flock together, to meet together.…The Bible says that we are not only the Lord’s sheep, but even more, His flock (Acts 20:28; 1 Pet. 5:2).<sup>152</sup> Our Christian life is not like the life of a butterfly, which does well on its own; our life is like the sheep’s life, requiring that we flock together and live a meeting life. Consequently, we need to meet. The meetings are crucial to us, and we should not forsake them.<sup>153</sup></p><p>The basic principle of the meetings of the church is that the meetings are a gathering of the believers by the Lord into His name [Matt. 18:20].…In gathering us together in His name, the Lord rescues us from all kinds of worldly and earthly distractions and occupations.…We especially need to be brought out of the self.…For every church meeting we need the Lord to bring us out of everything other than Himself and to gather us together into His name.<sup>154</sup></p><h2 class="head1">The Seven Categories of Gathering</h2><p>According to the New Testament, there are [only seven kinds of gatherings of the church.] These categories include the gathering for the Lord’s table [the bread-breaking meeting (Matt. 26:26-30; Luke 22:19-20; Acts 20:7a; 1 Cor. 11:20, 23-26; 10:16-17, 21)], the gathering for prayer [Matt. 18:19-20; Acts 1:14; 4:31; 12:5, 12], the gathering for edification by exercising the spiritual gifts [1 Cor. 14:26-32], the gathering for reading the Word of God [Acts 15:30-31; Col. 4:16], the gathering for listening to messages [Acts 20:7b], the gathering for preaching the gospel [2:14, 40-41; 5:42], and the gathering for fellowship regarding God’s move [14:27].<sup>155</sup><h2 class="head1">Consecrating the First Day of the Week to the Lord</h2><p>The Lord has purposely set aside one day out of the week and has called it the Lord’s Day.<sup>156</sup> We need to say a little word here about the difference between the Lord’s Day and Sunday. Sunday is a heathen, idolatrous term adopted by Catholicism and maintained by our tradition. Actually, it is idolatrous to say a day belongs to the sun. The Bible refers to this day as the first day of the week. Revelation 1:10 calls this day “the Lord’s Day.”</p><p>Today the whole world takes Sunday not mainly for worship but for pleasures, for sports, and for all kinds of entertainment. This is more evil than idol worship, but this tide has flooded many Christians.…We, however, should consider the first day of the week as a day for the Lord.<sup>157</sup> The Bible emphasizes three things that we should do on the first day of the week: [First, we should exult and rejoice, because it is the day of the Lord’s resurrection, the day Jehovah has made (Psa. 118:24). Second, we should gather together to break bread in remembrance of the Lord (Acts 20:7a; 1 Cor. 11:23-25). Third, according to 1 Corinthians 16:1-2], on the first day of every week, every one should offer to the Lord according to his income.…On one hand, we remember how the Lord gave Himself for us, and on the other hand, we also have to give to the Lord on this day.… Offering material goods to the Lord on His day is something that we should start practicing the moment we believe.…We should…tell the Lord, “Lord, You have given to me richly. Lord, I bring to You what I have gained and offer it to You.” You have to fix the amount that you will set aside. If you have much, you should offer more. If you have less, you can offer less.</p><p>This day is not our day; this day is the Lord’s Day. This time is not ours; this time is the Lord’s.…We hope that new brothers and sisters will pay attention to the Lord’s Day from the very beginning. Consecrate the first day of the week to the Lord and say to Him, “This is Your day.”…If we do this, we will see God’s blessing being showered abundantly upon the church.<sup>158</sup></p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p>
