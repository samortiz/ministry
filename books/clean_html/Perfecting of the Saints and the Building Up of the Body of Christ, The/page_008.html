<h2 class="head1">BY THE GIFTS&rsquo; PERFECTING</h2>
<p>By His death and resurrection, Christ has conquered Satan and death and has rescued man from the enslaving of Satan. In His ascension, He made these redeemed sinners the gifts through His resurrection life and gave them to the Body that they would do the perfecting work on the saints unto the building up of the Body of Christ. When I was first saved, I did not know anything. I did not know how to read the Bible or how to pray. At most, I had a heart to seek after the Lord and to love the Bible. Praise the Lord that through His riches in His ascension, the ascended Head gained a group of people from His redeemed ones and constituted them the gifts, putting them in the church to perfect us. There are the apostles who raise up churches and define doctrines. There are the prophets who speak for God and speak forth God. There are the evangelists who preach Christ to save sinners. There are the shepherds and teachers who supply life and teach the truth. When we are in the church life attending all the meetings time after time according to the way revealed by the Bible, spontaneously we are perfected in many ways. Gradually, we learn to understand the Bible, we pick up a taste for it, and we find ourselves getting into its riches. We also find ourselves preaching the gospel, feeding and teaching others, prophesying for the Lord, and speaking the Lord into others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING NO LONGER BABES</h2>
<p>When we are continuously perfected little by little in this way, we will produce the result in Ephesians 4:14-16. Verse 14 says, &ldquo;That we may be no longer babes tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error.&rdquo; This shows us that to be tossed by the waves and carried about by every wind of teaching is the condition of a babe. These teachings come from the sleight of men which is like the cheating of dice players. They also come in craftiness, leading men to a system of error. Actually, behind these winds and waves is the instigation of Satan, the enemy of God. God wants to build up the Body of Christ. But Satan uses the sleight of men and craftiness to lead men away from the building up of the Body of Christ to his system of error.</p>
<p>Before we were saved, we were in the system of the world. After we were saved, God put us in the church for the building up of the Body of Christ. But Satan deceitfully uses different winds of teaching to stir up the waves and blow the believers away from the building up of the Body of Christ into a system of error, which is Satan&rsquo;s system of darkness. However, if we remain in the proper church life and receive the perfecting mentioned in Ephesians 4:11-13, growing up in the divine life to be a full-grown man, having the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ and being no longer babes, we will not be deceived and will not be tossed by the craftiness of Satan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THREE WINDS OF TEACHING</h2>
<p>According to the history of the church, we see that most of its difficulties arose from winds of teaching, which are the different teachings. The different teachings came from different speakings, and the different speakings came from different opinions. When the different opinions are added to the sleight of men and craftiness, we have the winds and the waves. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been among us for over sixty years. I came in 1932, fifty-six years ago. During the first ten to twenty years, I was in mainland China. There I saw a lot of storms. In 1949 the Lord brought us overseas&mdash;first to Taiwan. Taiwan can be considered as the base of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery overseas. From here the recovery spread to Southeast Asia, to Japan and Korea, to America, then to Europe, Australasia, Africa, and then to the whole earth. During the last thirty-nine years, there were three or four times when we experienced waves. Every time, the waves came due to the winds, which were the different teachings and opinions. For example, in 1954, for the sake of receiving more help in the spiritual life, we invited Brother T. Austin-Sparks, one whom we considered most spiritual, to come to us. His coming did render us some help. But in private, he had a dissenting view concerning the ground of the church, a practice which we emphasized. He did not agree that the church should be one in each locality and attempted to persuade us to give up the church ground of oneness in the locality. When this dissension arose, some young co-workers who were considered the most advanced were affected. A big storm was stirred up, and it brought much damage to the churches.</p>
<p>During the last one or two years, winds of teaching have risen up again. This time they were not raised up in Taiwan. Rather, they originated from overseas. The first wind of teaching says that after the apostles appoint the elders, they can no longer be involved with the matters of a local church. This kind of speaking is contrary to the teaching of the New Testament. The New Testament shows us that after the apostles appointed the elders, although they entrusted to the elders the responsibility of caring for and leading the church, they themselves never removed their hands. On the contrary, they continued to perfect the saints and even to teach the elders. According to the record of Acts and the Epistles, after the apostles appointed the elders, they did their best to visit and strengthen the churches (Acts 15:36, 40-41; 1 Cor. 4:17; 11:34b). Paul even stayed in Corinth for a year and a half and in Ephesus for three years. During his last preaching journey, on his way back to Jerusalem, he sent for the elders in Ephesus to come to him that he might remind them, charge them, admonish them, and teach them. In his first letter to the Corinthians, he rebuked and instructed the Corinthians again and again. He even said that the remaining matters he would set in order when he came (11:34b). This clearly shows us that, in order to perfect the saints, the apostle cannot give up the church and leave his hands off after he appoints the elders. To say that the apostles cannot henceforth be involved with the church is a wrong teaching. Some are blowing this wind and are even practicing this openly. As a result, this has become a problem among us.</p>
<p>The second wind some are emphasizing is that every local church should be absolutely autonomous. The local church is established on the principle of one city one church. In a certain sense, the administration is by locality. For example, whether a church should break the bread on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning or the Lord&rsquo;s Day evening, or whether it should meet in one central hall or in a few dozen halls are matters related to the local administration of a local church. But on the other hand, the church is the Body of Christ. It is universal. All the millions of saved ones throughout the centuries are in this Body. The life within this Body is the life pulse of every member. It is like the blood circulation; you can never separate it into different parts. As far as the different parts of our body are concerned, you may say that this is the hand and that is the leg. But as far as the blood circulation is concerned, you cannot say that this is the blood of the hand and that is the blood of the leg. Hence, the management of a local church is, on the one hand, local in its administration yet, on the other hand, not isolated in its communication. Not only is there the mutual sharing of finance; even in other practical affairs we see the same thing. The churches in the various localities are managed separately, yet they are not separated absolutely. They are still the universal, corporate Body of Christ. For anyone to stress the autonomy or independence of a local church is too much. It destroys the oneness of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The third wind of teaching some are speaking is that the church is built up by the Lord Jesus Himself and that there is no need for man to build it. They base their words on Matthew 16:18. But according to the revelation of the New Testament, the Lord Jesus did not directly build up the church. Rather, first He perfected the gifts, and then He gave the gifts to the church. These gifted ones do not directly build up the church either. Rather, they perfect the saints, who are the many members of Christ. These saints directly build up the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:11-16). In conclusion, this is how Christ builds the church. Paul said in 1 Corinthians 3:10 that he had received a ministry from God, and as a wise master builder he had laid the unique foundation, which is Christ, upon which others might build. This clearly shows that the Lord builds the church through His many ministers, even through each of the many members in His Body. It is wrong for some to say that the building up of the church requires only the Lord Jesus and does not require any man.</p>
