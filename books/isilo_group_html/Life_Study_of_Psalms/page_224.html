THE REIGNING CHRIST</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Typified by the Reigning Solomon,<br>the Son of David, in His Prosperous<br>and Flourishing Time</H2><P>The reigning Christ is typified in Psalm 72 by the reigning Solomon, the son of David (Matt. 1:1; 22:42), in his prosperous and flourishing time. This is indicated by the title of this psalm, "Of Solomon," and by the first verse: "O God, give Your judgments to the king,/And Your righteousness to the son of the king.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Reigning of Christ</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. In the Millennium in the Age of Restoration</H2><P>The reign of Christ typified by Solomon will be in the millennium in the age of restoration (Rev. 20:4, 6; Matt. 19:28).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. In Righteousness and in Justice for Peace</H2><P>"He will judge Your people in righteousness,/And Your poor with justice./The mountains will bear peace to the people,/And the hills, in righteousness" (Psa. 72:2-3). This indicates that the reigning of Christ will be in righteousness and in justice for peace. He will be feared by the people throughout the generations as long as the sun and the moon endure (vv. 4-5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Dropping Like Rain upon Mown Grass<br>and Like Showers Dripping on the Earth</H2><P>As Christ reigns, He will drop like rain upon mown grass and like abundant showers dripping on the earth for the flourishing of the righteous and for abundance of peace on earth as long as the moon lasts (vv. 6-7).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Having Dominion from Sea to Sea<br>and from the River unto the Ends of the Earth</H2><P>Verse 8 says, "He will have dominion from sea to sea/And from the River unto the ends of the earth." From "sea to sea" means from the Mediterranean Sea to the Dead Sea. The river mentioned here is the Euphrates. As Christ exercises His dominion, all the nations will serve Him (vv. 9-11).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. His Favor to the Needy<br>and Their Response to Him</H2><P>Verses 12 through 15 speak of Christ's favor to the needy and their response to Him. He will deliver the needy when he cries, and the poor when there is no one to help him. He will have pity on the weak and needy and will save the souls of the needy, redeeming their soul from oppression. Verse 15 tells us of the response of the needy to the reigning of Christ. "He shall live and to Him shall be given/The gold of Sheba; /And prayer shall be made continually for Him;/He shall be blessed all the day long."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. A Blessing to All the Earth in Prosperity<br>and Their Response to Him</H2><P>In verse 16 we see that the reigning of Christ will be a blessing to all the earth in prosperity. "There will be an abundance of grain on the earth,/Even at the tops of the mountains./Its fruit will wave like the forests of Lebanon,/And those of the city will blossom like the foliage of the earth." Then in verse 17 we have the response of the blessed ones to Him. "His name will be forever;/As long as the sun endures, His name will spread;/And men will be blessed in Him;/All the nations will call Him blessed."</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_223.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_225.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Psalms &nbsp; pg 224</div><br></body></html>
