   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT THE THRONE ABOVE THE CLEAR SKY Scripture Reading: Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1:26; Acts 24:16; 1 John 1:7, 9; Exo 15:24-25; 24:10</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the last chapter we saw that above the heads of the living creatures there was a clear firmament, a clear sky, that was expanding and yet exceedingly stable.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The sky above their heads was so clear that it was terrible to look upon.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now we must see another point.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Above this clear sky was a throne.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to consider the meaning of the throne and to apply it to our experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE NEED OF A CLEAR SKY</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Please remember that we Christians need to maintain a clear sky with the Lord, meaning that we need always to have a clear fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should have nothing between us and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our sky must be crystal clear.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that our conscience is clear and void of any offense Acts 24:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we would have a clear sky, a crystal heaven before the Lord, we must have a pure conscience, a conscience without any offense.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whenever we have a particular condemnation or offense on our conscience, immediately our sky becomes cloudy, darkened, and foggy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At such a time we must confess our failure and our sin to the Lord and apply His precious blood 1 John 1:7, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This will give us a cleansed, pure conscience, a conscience void of offense.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We will then have a clear sky and clear fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There will be nothing between us and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sometimes a very small matter, such as a poor attitude toward our wife or husband, can cause us to have a cloud in our sky.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Perhaps she is wrong, but our attitude is also wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our poor attitude brings a cloud and a shadow into our sky.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Right away our joy is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have no peace and no anointing to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It even seems as if there is some kind of disease within us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our conscience begins to condemn and bother us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the loss of a clear Christian sky.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the loss of a clear heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We no longer have a clear heaven because something is between us and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It may remain for several days until we are forced to go to the Lord and to ask His forgiveness for our bad attitude toward our wife.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By the Lord's anointing, we have the sensation that we also need to go to our dear wife and confess and apologize.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is difficult, because it is hard for a man to lose his face before a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have confessed to the Lord, but now the Lord says we must go to our wife and confess.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because we consider ourselves to be a man and we hate to lose our face to a female, we would insist on not going and confessing to her.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This causes us to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We do not have a broad, smiling face and we cannot talk about anything with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When people ask us, "What is wrong?" we say, "Nothing," but really that is not the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In fact, there really is something wrong; there is a problem between us and our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is not only something between us and our dear wife, it is also a cloud between us and our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Eventually, because we have lost the Lord's presence, we are forced to go to our dear wife and confess to her and apologize and ask her forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Right away the weather changes.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Immediately the cloud is gone and the clear sky returns.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Something within is once again living and jumping and we can shout, "Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have a clear sky once again.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have the firmament like the terrible crystal over the heads of all the living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the living creatures are under such a clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This kind of experience must be our daily life and also must be our church life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Every local church must be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE THRONE ABOVE THE CLEAR SKY</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whenever we have such a clear sky in our Christian life and in our church life, we will also have the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Above such a clear sky is the throne 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The throne is the center of this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The throne is where the Lord is.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We may talk about having the Lord's presence, but we should never forget that with the Lord's presence, there is always His throne.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Where the Lord is, there His throne is.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Where His throne is, there He is.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We can never have His presence apart from His throne.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We know that the Lord's throne today is in the third heaven, but the Lord's throne is also within our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As Christians in the local churches, we all have to be under a clear, crystal, extensive sky.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We all need a clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Above such a clear sky is the throne of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>By having such a clear sky, we are spontaneously brought under the government of the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We are under the rule and reigning of the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We Christians should be always under this rule.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Do we need policemen and law courts to rule over us?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If so, this means we are not under the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Day and night we need to be under the throne of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Sometimes, we want to say a certain thing to others, but our sky is not clear and the throne is before us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>From that throne comes forth some ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>As we start to speak, even as the words come to the end of our tongue, the throne exercises the ruling and we are forced to swallow all the words.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Sometimes we become angry with our wives and our temper rises, but the throne is before us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Right away our temper goes down.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Our temper is changed into a "Hallelujah!"</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>While we are being tempted to give our wives a long face, the throne comes in and we are forced to smile.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Who rules over us?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is not even the teachings of the Bible that rule over us it is the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In our Christian life and in our church life, if our sky is clear, the throne will be there.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But if our sky is cloudy and full of darkness, we will not see the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When we do not see the throne, we will be able to be loose and to do many things according to our own taste and convenience.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This means there is no clear sky and no throne.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Because we are under darkness, we can be loose.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We can speak what we want to speak; we can express what we want to express; we can go where we desire to go.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But a person who is under the throne cannot behave in that way.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>A person under the throne has no choice.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In one sense, because we are saved we are really liberated, but in another sense we are under the throne and have no liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Many times I wanted to go to the department store, but when I arrived at the entrance, I could not go in because of the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Sometimes I forced myself to go into a few of the stores.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Nevertheless, I dared not look around because the throne was still ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Then I told the Lord, "Lord, let me go this one time."</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>It seemed as if the Lord said, "Okay, you go ahead."</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>But then for three weeks I could not pray properly.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>I lost my clear Christian sky.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>That was a real punishment from the Lord to me.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>I said, "Lord, You gave me permission."</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>But the Lord said, "Yes, I gave you permission to lose My presence.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>I will take away My presence from you for three weeks."</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Then I said, "Oh Lord, I just apply your blood."</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>But the Lord replied, "Don't play with Me. My blood is not that cheap.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Don't play with Me."</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Praise the Lord for the clear sky!</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Praise the Lord for the throne!</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Above our heads is the firmament and above the firmament is the throne.</S>
