 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT<br />
BY PRAISING AND SINGING<br />
IN THE CHURCH MEETINGS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 45:1-15</h1>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO BE IN THE SPIRIT<br />
IN ORDER TO OVERFLOW</h2>
<p>In this message we would like to see something regarding the flow of the Spirit and the exercise of our spirit in Psalm 45. Psalm 45 is a psalm that praises Christ and speaks of Christ as the King. Verse 1 says, &ldquo;My heart overflows with a good matter.&rdquo; Overflowing is a matter of our spirit. As Christians we must be constantly overflowing because we have something good to tell people, and this should cause us to praise, sing, and overflow. The people around us, the angels, the demons, and all the created things in this universe should hear us overflowing with a good matter. We all need to be like the psalmist, overflowing with something by speaking forth, singing, and praising.</p>
<p>Verse 1 continues, &ldquo;I speak what I have composed concerning the King.&rdquo; If we are in the spirit, we will always have something composed concerning the Lord and will always be overflowing. This is not a matter of mere knowledge, teaching, or doctrine but a matter in the spirit and of the spirit. The verse ends by saying, &ldquo;My tongue is the pen of a ready writer.&rdquo; The composer&rsquo;s pen is his tongue. This indicates that our tongue should always be ready to compose something in praise of the Lord, and the only way we can be ready is by being in the spirit. By exercising our spirit the whole day, we will be like a ready writer. However, if we walk, act, and do things not in the spirit but in the soul or the mind, we will not sing any songs to the Lord. We may sing songs in the meetings when we are with others, but we will not sing songs when we are by ourselves, because such songs can be sung only in the spirit. This is one way we can check whether or not we as Christians are normal.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DEATH AND RESURRECTION OF CHRIST<br />
SIGNIFIED BY MYRRH AND CASSIA</h2>
<p>The next verse speaks of the King, who is Christ the Lord. &ldquo;You are fairer than the sons of men; / Grace is poured upon Your lips; / Therefore God has blessed You forever&rdquo; (v. 2). This verse clearly speaks of Christ, who spoke words of grace (Luke 4:22) and is God blessed forever (Rom. 9:5). The first part of Psalm 45:8 says, &ldquo;All Your garments smell of myrrh and aloes, of cassia.&rdquo; The myrrh and aloes in verse 8 signify the death and burial of Christ. In those days after someone died, his relatives would bury him with myrrh and aloes. After the Lord died on the cross, Nicodemus, a rich man, claimed His body and anointed His body with myrrh and aloes before His burial (John 19:39), indicating that these two spices signify death and burial. Garments in the Scriptures signify a person&rsquo;s deeds or works. Thus, the Lord&rsquo;s righteous deeds and works were full of the sweet-smelling fragrance of His death. Whenever we think of the Lord, His righteousness, and all that He did, we sense the sweetness of His death. This is the sweet smell of myrrh and aloes upon His garments.</p>
<p>Cassia is a kind of wood that produces an oil that is sweet and good for healing. If you want to extract the oil out of the wood, you must &ldquo;kill&rdquo; the wood. The wood must suffer death in order for the healing oil to come out from the wood. Thus, cassia signifies Christ in resurrection. The Lord is like the wood; He suffered the killing, and as a result, something came out of Him and into us&mdash;the healing Spirit, the Spirit in the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection (John 20:22; cf. Luke 10:34). Whenever we think of the Lord and of His deeds and acts, we automatically sense the sweetness of His death and resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCHES SIGNIFIED BY THE IVORY PALACES</h2>
<p>Although this psalm is a psalm of praise of the King, the second part of the psalm speaks of the queen instead of the King. Verses 8b-13 say, &ldquo;From palaces of ivory, harpstrings have made You glad / The daughters of kings are among Your most prized; / The queen stands at Your right hand in the gold of Ophir. / Hear, O daughter, and see; and incline your ear; / And forget your people and your father&rsquo;s house; / Thus the King will desire your beauty. / Because He is your Lord, / Worship Him. / And the daughter of Tyre will come with a gift; / The rich among the people will entreat your favor. / The King&rsquo;s daughter is all glorious within the royal abode; / Her garment is a woven work inwrought with gold. / She will be led to the King in embroidered clothing; / The virgins behind her, her companions, / Will be brought to You. / They will be led with rejoicing and exultation; / They will enter the King&rsquo;s palace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you read this psalm, you will notice that although it praises the King, it also speaks much about the queen, who is a type of the church. This psalm praises Christ, but it also praises Christ with the church, which was produced after Christ&rsquo;s ascension. Although the psalmist most likely did not know the spiritual significance of what he was writing, the Holy Spirit caused him to write first concerning the death and resurrection of Christ and then concerning the church.</p>
<p>Recently I reviewed a hymn in which the phrase <em>ivory palaces</em> from verse 8 was misinterpreted. The hymn implied that the ivory palaces were the heavenly mansions from which the Lord Jesus came to this world of woe. This is not correct, because the king in this psalm is King Solomon, and we know that Solomon is a type of the ascended, glorified, and coming Christ, not the suffering Christ typified by King David. Thus, the writer of the hymn should not have associated King Solomon with the suffering Christ who came down from heaven to this world of woe to suffer. What then is the correct interpretation of the phrase <em>ivory palaces?</em> In 1956 we spent much time during a training to study the books of poetry, and we realized something regarding this matter.</p>
<p>The ivory palaces in this psalm are a type of the local churches. Ivory is a kind of bone that has been taken out of a body. In the Scriptures, when a bone is taken out of a body and is separated from it, in a sense the bone passes through death, and after it passes through death, it becomes something. The first mention in the Scriptures of a bone being separated from a body is in Genesis with Adam and Eve (2:21-22). In this example Adam was put to sleep, God opened up his side, and a bone was taken from his side. That bone became Eve, Adam&rsquo;s wife and counterpart, who was a type of the church (Eph. 5:31-32; cf. Gen. 2:24). In the New Testament God did the same thing to Christ. God caused Christ to be put to sleep on the cross and caused His side to be opened, and what came out of Christ&rsquo;s side was blood and water (John 19:34). The water signifies the resurrection life of Christ, and it is by this life that the church came into being. Just as the bone taken out from Adam passed through death and became a wife to Adam, so also the resurrection life of Christ passed through death and became the church, the counterpart of Christ. Thus, the ivory in Psalm 45 signifies the resurrection life of Christ (cf. John 19:36), and the palaces signify the local churches, which come into being through the death and resurrection of Christ.</p>
