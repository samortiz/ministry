 <h2 class="head1">THE TRAINING FOR THE CAMPUS WORK</h2>
<p>All these points that I have fellowshipped about are areas in which we need to be trained. We must know the way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We need to pursue and enter deeply into the truth. We need to have the experience and growth in life. Furthermore, we need to be built up in the way we conduct ourselves. We must go on from knowing how to conduct ourselves to knowing how to do things, and from knowing how to do things to knowing how to work for the Lord. Regarding the content of the training, I hope that we would be able to coordinate with the campus work in a practical way. I hope that we could have two to three months to be trained to practice how to do a campus work to gain the students. We have much to learn in every aspect in order to handle the need of this work.</p>
<p>Regarding the arrangement of the training schedule, the morning time for pursuing the Word should continue. Another time should be set aside for us to be trained to do the campus work. We all know that every country in the world that does not emphasize education will fall behind. The main reason why Taiwan is prosperous today is that in these years the university students are being educated quite well. Because of this, we must now pay attention to the campuses.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the campus work is also the Lord&rsquo;s flow on the earth today. I have noticed that not only in America and Asia but also in Europe and South America, the college students are very willing to receive the truth, especially the truth in the Bible. Recently in America we sent out gospel teams, with ten people on each team, to the various campuses to take care of the Lord&rsquo;s need. On the campus we do not preach the ordinary gospel but the gospel of the truth. In many places, the first message we give is on the Triune God. This is very attractive in the United States. More than half of the college students in America were born into Christian families. They have already heard many shallow teachings. If we preach the same old teachings, they will feel bored, even though they still desire to know something about God. Therefore, we are eager to publish the New Testament Recovery Version in English to meet this need. Many college students greatly welcomed the New Testament Recovery Version when they saw it.</p>
<p>There is a way and a technique to do things and to work for the Lord. In Philippians 4:12 Paul speaks of the &ldquo;secret,&rdquo; referring to the key to doing things. Not only do we need the Spirit and the Word in preaching the gospel; we also need the content. Some brothers are strong in their spirit, but the content of their gospel is very light. Therefore, they do not gain many people. The standard of education for the young people has been greatly raised. The young people have their own logic, philosophy, and thinking. The truths in the Lord&rsquo;s Word are very logical and are able to meet the real inner need of people. When we contact the college students on the campuses, the question we must ask is how do we present these logical, high, and rich truths to them in a clear fashion? If we learn the way to contact people and the key in speaking to them, we will be able to touch people in their hearts and gain them right away. Therefore, there is a great deal to learn in this matter.</p>
<p>There are so many of you attending the Full-Time Training. If you go out to work in an ordinary fashion, it will not only be a waste of time but also a waste of your learning. You should cherish the training that you have received to carry out the proper work on the campuses by contacting and gaining the college students. In addition, you must also continue in the basic training and learning. You need to take care of such things as prayer, coordination, fellowship with the Lord, and not being individualistic.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING UP OF OUR HUMAN CHARACTER<br />
BEING THE SECRET</h2>
<p>In taking care of practical things and working for the Lord, you do not need to get into the particulars. You simply need to grasp the &ldquo;secret&rdquo; and pay attention to being efficient. If you are too particular, you cannot be efficient. Nevertheless, you have to lay hold of the &ldquo;secret.&rdquo; In order for you to be efficient in doing things and in working, you must first build yourselves up in your human character. Regardless of where I move to, the first thing I do is clean the house thoroughly and then settle down. If you conduct yourselves in a loose way, seeking only for a place to lie down and sleep, this will spoil your character. Not only so, when you work or serve, you will be unprepared and bewildered. This is not acceptable.</p>
<p>Therefore, you need to take this comprehensive message of mine. Do not wait until someone comes to supervise you. Rather, you need to take the initiative to learn here. You have all graduated from college, so you should know what to do. If you learn, practice, and endeavor to build yourselves up in all the points that I have mentioned, the Lord will have a way in you. The urgent need in the Lord&rsquo;s work today is that we would do the campus work to gain the young people for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery that we may have a promising future.</p>
