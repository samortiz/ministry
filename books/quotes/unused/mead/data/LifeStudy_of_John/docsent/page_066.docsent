   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF JOHN MESSAGE SEVENTEEN THE NEED OF THE THIRSTY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>LIFE S QUENCHING 1</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have covered five of the nine cases in this gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the first case, the Lord talked with a superior, moral man about the regeneration of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Through the new birth, the Lord is our second life, the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the second case, the Lord spoke to an inferior, immoral woman about the satisfaction of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord Himself is the living water which satisfies the dissatisfied hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the third case, the Lord healed a dying child.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord heals the dying people by His life-giving word through believing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the fourth case, the Lord enlivened an impotent man who had been sick for thirty-eight years.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This shows that the Lord enlivens the impotent by life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the fifth case, the Lord fed the five thousand with the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates that He is the living, heavenly bread with which to satisfy the hungry multitude.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, in brief, the Lord regenerates with His divine life in the first case, gives the living water in the second case, heals the dying by the life-giving word in the third case, enlivens the impotent in the fourth case, and feeds the multitude with the bread of life in the fifth case.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now in chapter seven we come to the sixth case the need of the thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This case is in contrast with the fifth case, the need of the hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the previous case the Lord is clearly revealed as the bread of life to satisfy our hunger, but in this case the Lord brings the flow of living water to quench our thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the fifth case the people are hungry, but in the sixth case they are thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The fifth case presents the living bread, and the sixth case introduces the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The bread of life is for hungry people, and the rivers of living water are for thirsty people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For the thirsty, Christ is the quenching life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is the very life that is able to quench man s thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The thought that the Lord is our food and water is seen throughout the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For example, in Genesis 2 the tree of life is a picture of the Lord as our life supply of food.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Beside the tree of life in Genesis 2 there is the river of water, which is a portrait of the Lord bringing us the rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In other words, this pictures the Lord s purpose in the creation of man man must eat and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If he fails to eat, he will become hungry, and if he fails to drink, he will become thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord is the food to satisfy our hunger, and He has the living water to quench our thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Later in the Scriptures, the children of Israel, as they traveled through the wilderness, also had both food and water.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the one hand, they had the manna from heaven as their daily food Exo 16:14-15 ; on the other hand, they had the living water flowing from the smitten rock to quench their thirst Exo 17:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Gospel of John, the Lord also is the living bread and He offers the living water to satisfy the hunger and the thirst of the multitude.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit, the three Persons of the Triune God, are very much related to this matter of food and water.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God the Father is the source, God the Son is the food, and God the Spirit is the drink.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The first Person of the Triune God is the source of the second Person as the food, from whom the third Person flows out as the drink.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First Corinthians 10:3-4 also points out these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There, Christ Himself is the spiritual food and He is the smitten rock from which flows the spiritual drink.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Holy Spirit is the spiritual drink flowing out of the crucified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, Christ is our food, and the Holy Spirit who flows out of Christ is our drink.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Finally, we come to the end of the Scriptures, where we see the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Again, the flow of the living water is the Holy Spirit, and the tree of life growing in the flow is Christ Rev 22:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, there is a line running throughout the whole Scriptures showing us that Christ is our spiritual food, that the Holy Spirit is our spiritual drink, and that man needs both to eat and to drink in order to satisfy his hunger and thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Gospel of John is a book of pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The writer used figures and pictures as well as plain words because the matters of life are too deep, profound, mysterious, and abstract.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If John had only used plain words, it would have been difficult for people to probe into the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>So John, under God s inspiration, used various pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In chapter four we have a picture of a thirsty Savior and a thirsty sinner meeting at Jacob s well.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In chapter five we see a multitude of sick, blind, lame, and withered people waiting by a pool.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In chapter six we see a wilderness, a mountain, and a stormy sea.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the sea is a boat, tossed to and fro, and the people in the boat are terrified.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Suddenly a man comes to them walking upon the waves.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the man who fed the hungry crowd with five loaves and two fishes.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In chapter seven we see still another picture.</S>
