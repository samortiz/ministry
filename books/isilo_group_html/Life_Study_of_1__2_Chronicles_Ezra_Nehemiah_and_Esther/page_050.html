THE REBUILDING OF THE WALL OF THE CITY<br />
OF JERUSALEM UNDER NEHEMIAH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Report of the Condition of Jerusalem</h2>
<p>In 1:1-3 we have a report of the condition of Jerusalem. According to this report the remnant of the returned captivity were in an exceedingly bad state and reproach (v. 3a). The wall of Jerusalem was broken down and its gates had been burned with fire (v. 3b).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Nehemiah&rsquo;s Prayer by Fasting</h2>
<p>In his prayer by fasting (vv. 4-11), Nehemiah first praised God for what He is, praising Him for His keeping of His covenant and lovingkindness with those who love Him and keep His commandments (v. 5). Then he confessed the sins of the children of Israel (vv. 6-7) and asked God to remember His word to Moses that He would bring the captivity of His people even from the ends of heaven back to the place of His dwelling (vv. 8-9). Nehemiah stood on God&rsquo;s word and prayed according to it. Thus, God was bound by His own word. Nehemiah continued by begging God to hear his prayer and the prayer of those who took delight in fearing His name and to cause him to prosper and to find compassion before Artaxerxes the king of Persia (vv. 10-11a).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The King&rsquo;s Favor<br />
in Giving Permission to Nehemiah</h2>
<p>In 2:1-8 we see the king&rsquo;s favor in giving permission to Nehemiah.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Nehemiah&rsquo;s Journey to Jerusalem<br />
and His Personal Observation</h2>
<p>Verses 9 through 16 speak of Nehemiah&rsquo;s journey to Jerusalem and his personal observation of the condition of the wall of the city of Jerusalem. The leaders of the Moabites and Ammonites were greatly displeased about Nehemiah&rsquo;s seeking the good of the children of Israel (v. 10). The Moabites and the Ammonites, descendants of sons born of Lot, hated and despised the children of Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Rebuilding of the Wall of Jerusalem</h2>
<p>Nehemiah 2:17-20 is a word concerning the rebuilding of the wall of Jerusalem. The leaders of the Moabites and Ammonites mocked and despised the children of Israel and asked whether they would rebel against the king by doing this (v. 19). Nehemiah answered them by saying, &ldquo;The God of heaven Himself will make us prosper; therefore we His servants will rise up and build. But you have no portion nor right nor memorial in Jerusalem&rdquo; (v. 20). This answer indicates that Nehemiah was very aggressive. He surely was not cowardly. Anyone who is cowardly cannot be a servant of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. A Record of the Building of the Wall<br />
in Consecutive Sections</h2>
<p>Chapter three is a record of the building of the wall in consecutive sections by all the children of Israel with the priests and Levites.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. The Frustration of the Enemy</h2>
<p>Chapter four describes the frustration of the enemy.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Enemies Becoming Angry</h2>
<p>The enemies became angry and greatly enraged, and again they mocked the Jews and despised their building (vv. 1-3).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Nehemiah Trusting in God</h2>
<p>Nehemiah trusted in God by praying that God would return their reproach to themselves. Thus the Jews built the wall, and all the wall was joined together to half its height, for they had a heart to work (vv. 4-6). Today, no matter how much we may be mocked and despised, we should have a heart to build and should be aggressive.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Enemies Being Angry<br />
Because the Building Work Was Advancing</h2>
<p>The enemies were angry because the building work was advancing, and they conspired to come and fight against Jerusalem (vv. 7-8).</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Jews Praying to Their God<br />
and Setting a Watch against the Enemy</h2>
<p>The Jews prayed to their God, and under Nehemiah&rsquo;s instruction and direction set a watch against the enemy day and night, ready to fight with weapons under the encouragement of Nehemiah, who instructed them to remember the great and awesome Lord and fight for their families. Half of Nehemiah&rsquo;s servants labored in the work, and half of them held weapons, ready to fight. Some built the wall and some carried burdens, taking the loads with one hand doing the work and with the other hand holding a weapon. The one who would sound the trumpet was beside Nehemiah, to gather them to fight, trusting that their God would fight for them. This indicates that, as the commander-in-chief, Nehemiah took the lead to watch. Thus, they labored and half of them held spears from the start of dawn until the stars came out, and Nehemiah and his brothers, servants, and the men of the guard, none of them took off their clothes. Each had his weapon at his right hand (vv. 9-23).</p>
<p>On the one hand, the children of Israel were prepared to fight; on the other hand, they trusted in God that He would fight for them. In this matter also they were aggressive. Those who are cowardly might say that, since God will fight for us, there is no need for us to do anything. But in a very real sense, God will help those who help themselves. If you do not help yourself, God will not help you. According to history, God does not help the cowardly. It is the aggressive ones who have received help from God.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_049.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_051.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of 1 & 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther &nbsp; pg 50</div><br></body></html>
