   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE HAVING A MIND TO SUFFER ONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In addition to the character traits already mentioned, every Christian worker should have a mind to suffer 1 Pet 4:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Before we consider this subject from a positive point of view, let us first consider the common Christian concept of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The teaching of the Scriptures is very clear: God has no intention for His people to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is a certain philosophy which promotes physical suffering as a means of depriving the body of all enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Those who hold to this philosophy maintain that every form of enjoyment is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As the Lord's workers and those who represent Him, we must be clear that this philosophy should not be in a Christian's mind at all.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God's own Word declares that God has no intention for His children to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Bible says that God has not withheld any good thing from us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Psalm 23:1 says, "Jehovah is my Shepherd; I will lack nothing."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The words lack nothing do not mean that we have no further needs.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Rather, they mean that we do not have to ask for anything because the Lord is our Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Psalm 23 tells us that we will lack nothing when we have the Lord as our Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In other words, God has no intention that we lack anything.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His intention is for us to be filled.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He has not withheld any good thing from us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The entire Bible portrays to us the loving care of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He watched over His own faithfully, relieved their distresses and pains, and drew a clear distinction between His people and the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The land of Goshen was always different from the rest of Egypt; God's blessing was always there.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must never introduce any kind of ascetic philosophy into Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once we introduce non-Christian elements into Christianity, we confuse the latter.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must pay attention to this point.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Having said this, we also should realize that God does not exempt His children from trial or chastisement; indeed, God gives His children trial and chastisement.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But we must make a clear distinction between these and forms of asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Under ordinary circumstances, God always blesses, cares, supports, and supplies His children.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But when it becomes necessary for Him to chastise and try His children, He will not hesitate to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This does not mean that He tries them every day.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He chastises His children only when the need arises; He does not do this every day and every minute.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God does not send trials and chastisements to His children continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sometimes He resorts to such methods, but He does not dwell on them all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the contrary, under ordinary circumstances, He always cares for us and makes provisions for us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Of course, when we are stubborn, He will allow trials and chastisements to come upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But under His usual provisions, He carries out what He ordinarily would do.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He does not want to see us suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must be clear about this.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God is reserving all the good things for His children.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We can enjoy all of His provisions which He has given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What then does the Scripture mean when it speaks of suffering?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the Bible, suffering refers to a deliberate choice one makes before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord has arranged for our days to be filled with gracious blessings, but for the sake of serving Him and being a servant to Him, we would rather choose a way of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, the way of suffering is a way of choice.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>David's three mighty men could have lived in safety beside David, but when they heard him expressing a longing for a drink from the well of Bethlehem, they endangered their lives and broke through the ranks of the Philistine host to fetch the water 2 Sam 23:14-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Suffering is a matter of choice, not a matter of imposition.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We choose the way of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We suffer willingly for the sake of serving Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to God's plan, we can avoid many sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, for the sake of serving God, we would rather gladly choose a way that is different from that of ordinary people.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is what it means to have a mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Having a mind to suffer is a fundamental necessity in the character of a servant of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Without such a mind, we will produce little results in our work, and the work we do will be very superficial in quality.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If a worker of the Lord does not have a mind to suffer, he cannot work at all in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Let us speak of a few things related to this subject.</S>
