   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Longsuffering and Endurance</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In these verses James speaks both of longsuffering and endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He uses the prophets as an example of longsuffering and Job as an example of endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How shall we differentiate longsuffering and endurance?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After much study I have concluded that longsuffering is a matter of patience toward persons.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we are persecuted, we need longsuffering.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, longsuffering is an expression of our patience toward people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The prophets were persecuted, but they were longsuffering toward their persecutors.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Endurance, on the contrary, is an expression of our patience toward the things that afflict us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, when Job suffered affliction, he displayed endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Job s suffering was not that of persecution but that of calamities.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In his writing James uses the Greek words for longsuffering and endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>While we are awaiting the Lord s coming back, we need both longsuffering and endurance because we face suffering from two sources.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These sources are persons who persecute us and the environment that afflicts us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, a brother may have an accident, and his new car may be damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For that, he does not need longsuffering; he needs endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The car has not done anything to persecute him, but he does suffer from a particular environmental affliction.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For that affliction he needs endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, if this brother is mistreated by his boss, he will need longsuffering toward his boss.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But if he loses his job, suffering as a result of that environmental affliction, he will once again need endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to exercise longsuffering toward people and endurance toward environmental afflictions.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For the Lord s coming back, we need longsuffering, endurance, and the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As we are exercising longsuffering toward those who persecute us and endurance toward afflictions, we need to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then we shall be able to say, O Lord Jesus, come back sooner.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Lord, can t You see that I am growing in life?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today I am growing faster than yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because I am growing, Lord, I ask You to speed up Your coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Have you ever prayed like this?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I doubt that many Christians have prayed in this way concerning the Lord s coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to realize that the Lord s coming is related to our growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we fulfill the condition of growing in life, the Lord will fulfill the condition of coming back sooner.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, we need to grow in life, and as we are growing, to exercise longsuffering and endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the proper way to await the Lord s coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord s Parousia</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Earlier in this message we pointed out that the Greek word for coming in 5:7 and 8 is parousia, which means presence.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord s parousia will last for a period of time, at least three and a half years, the length of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The parousia is likely to begin a little earlier than the tribulation, and it may conclude a little before the end of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is very difficult for us to know when this will be, because the Lord Jesus has said that only the Father knows the time of His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This means that the time of the beginning of the Lord s parousia is a secret kept confidential in the Father s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But according to the study of prophecy in the Scriptures, we can say that the parousia will begin a little earlier than the start of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Most Christians do not understand the Lord s coming as being a matter of the parousia, His presence over a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead, many believers think that the coming of the Lord will be somewhat like an accident.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Actually, the Lord s parousia will last for a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to James word, we need to await the coming of the Lord, His parousia, with longsuffering and endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Furthermore, as we are waiting we need to grow in life unto maturity.</S>
