   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN THE FUNCTIONS OF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SPIRIT OF RESURRECTION THE WORD IN JOHN 1 AND WORDS IN JOHN 6</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John 1:1 says, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, and 6:63 says, The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Both verses speak of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Chapter 1 speaks of the Word that was in the beginning, and chapter 6 speaks of the words which the Lord has spoken to us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is the difference between the two?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How does the Word in chapter 1 become words in chapter 6?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Is there a difference in their function?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This matter surely requires much study.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Logos and Rhema</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>John 1 starts with In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then chapter 6 says that the words the Lord speaks are spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In chapter 1 the Word is God Himself, and in chapter 6 the words are something that comes out from God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Word in chapter 1 is a complete entity; however, the words in chapter 6 are in smaller parts.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We can say that Word, logos, in chapter 1 denotes great words, like an entire lamb, but words, rhema, in chapter 6 denotes small words, like many pieces of meat cut from the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This illustration is very expressive.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It shows that the Word in chapter 1 is the Lord Himself and that the words in chapter 6 are something that comes out from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the difference between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God Being in Christ and Christ Becoming the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>John 1:1 says, The Word was God, and verse 14 says, The Word became flesh ; flesh refers to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that the great words in chapter 1 refer to God who became flesh, that is, God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the one hand, the Word is God; on the other hand, it is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In chapter 6 Christ became the Spirit through death and resurrection to be small words for us to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, the words in chapter 6 are Christ who has become the Spirit; they are Christ on the one hand and the Spirit on the other.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Function of the Word in Chapter 1</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Being Different from</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That of the Words in Chapter 6</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The great Word in chapter 1 is God manifested among us as life, but He still cannot enter into us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When He becomes the small words in chapter 6, He enters into us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here we see the function of the Word and the words: the former manifests Him among us as life, and the latter enters into us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A whole lamb can only be displayed among us, but it cannot be eaten.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only when a lamb is slaughtered and processed can it be cut into many pieces to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In chapter 6 this meat is placed before us for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The great Word is displayed for us to see in chapter 1, but the small words are for us to eat and enjoy in chapter 6.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lamb we see on display outside of us has become meat on the table for our enjoyment; these are the different functions of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Word in chapter 1, through the Lord s death and resurrection, has entered into resurrection to become words in chapter 6 which can be eaten and received by us and can enter into us to be our life and supply.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Passing through Death and Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How do we know that the words spoken of in chapter 6 have passed through death and resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to 6:55, the Lord said, My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The separation of blood and flesh indicates death.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In verse 63 the Lord also said, The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord becoming the Spirit indicates resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Instead of merely reading the black and white letters in the Bible, we need to find their spiritual significance.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord can enter into us to be our enjoyment and life because He has passed through death and resurrection, experiencing the separation of blood and flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He not only has been manifested among us as life; now He can be eaten, received, and digested by us to become life in us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the Gospel of John there are two great turns.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The first great turn is the Word becoming flesh, and the second is the Lord becoming the Spirit through death and resurrection; hence, death and resurrection is a great turn.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>John 14 speaks of the Lord s going and coming.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord s going is His death, and His coming is His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord s coming after His resurrection is His coming as the Spirit into us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In His death He was crucified in the flesh, and in His resurrection He became the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As the Spirit, the Lord can come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In 14:18 the Lord said, I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The preceding verse says, The Spirit of reality...abides with you and shall be in you.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This shows that the Lord comes as the Spirit to be in us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then verse 20 continues, In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We know that the two references to in refer to the Lord s resurrection since He also said, Because I live, you also shall live v. 19 . Both instances of live refer to His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord was referring to His resurrection when He spoke these words in 14:19-20; in particular, the phrase in that day in verse 20 refers to the day of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In verse 19 He said, Because I live implying resurrection , you also shall live.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He spoke of us living because as the I, He is living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord lives in us so that we may live; therefore, because I live, you also shall live is a matter of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Verse 20 continues, You will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After resurrection, He can come into us instantly.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Verses 16 and 17 show that in His resurrection He became the Spirit to enter into us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the reason we say that the Lord as the Word in chapter 1 became flesh and was manifested among us but that He had not yet entered into us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is not until chapter 14, when He spoke of passing through death and resurrection and becoming the Spirit, that we can see how He can enter into us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When the Lord was manifested, He was shown and displayed, but He could not be enjoyed by us because He had not yet become our life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is only after He enters into us that He can become our life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then it is possible to say that because He lives, we also shall live.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He has made it possible for us to also live with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is because He lives in us that we also can live with Him.</S>
