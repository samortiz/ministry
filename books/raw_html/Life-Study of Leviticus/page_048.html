<h2 class=head1>XIII. WAFERS</h2><p>A meal offering may also be of “unleavened wafers anointed with oil” (v. 4b).<h2 class=head2>A. Hollow, Easy to Eat</h2><p>Wafers are hollow and easy to eat. This signifies Christ in His humanity enjoyed and experienced by the younger believers. Christ as cakes is good for the strong ones, and Christ as wafers is good for the young ones. He is available to all ages. Praise the Lord that He is so edible!<h2 class=head2>B. Unleavened</h2><p>Again, being unleavened signifies that Christ as the meal offering is without sin or any negative thing.<h2 class=head2>C. Anointed with Oil</h2><p>The wafers are anointed with oil. This signifies that Christ is anointed with the Holy Spirit, having the Holy Spirit poured upon Him.<h2 class=head1>XIV. FINE FLOUR ON THE GRIDDLE</h2><p>“And if your offering is a meal offering on the griddle, it shall be of fine flour mingled with oil, unleavened. You shall break it into pieces and pour oil on it; it is a meal offering” (vv. 5-6). In this kind of meal offering, the fine flour is without form. It is not even dough but simply flour on the griddle.<h2 class=head2>A. Unleavened</h2><p>Once again, being unleavened signifies being without sin or negative things.<h2 class=head2>B. Mingled with Oil</h2><p>The fine flour was mingled not with water but with oil. Although this mingling did not produce dough, it did cause the meal offering to be of a single piece. Here again, being mingled with oil signifies being mingled with the Holy Spirit.<h2 class=head2>C. Broken into Pieces</h2><p>This meal offering was broken into pieces. This signifies that Christ’s humanity is perfect but is never kept whole. It is always broken. This breaking refers to another kind of suffering which Christ passed through in His humanity.<h2 class=head2>D. The Pieces with Oil Poured upon Them</h2><p>The pieces with oil poured upon them signify Christ’s being anointed with the Holy Spirit.<p>Here we have a picture of Christ’s experience of the Spirit of God. First, He was born of the Spirit of God (Matt. 1:18, 20). This was a matter of His being mingled with the Spirit. Then, at the age of thirty, He was anointed with the Spirit of God. The Holy Spirit was poured upon Him after His water baptism (Matt. 3:16). Therefore, even in this small meal offering we can see the two aspects of Christ’s experience of the Holy Spirit.
