   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>COORDINATION IN THE MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must also practice this kind of coordination in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some brothers and sisters love to shout in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When they come in, they are shouting; during the meeting, they are shouting; they love to shout.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Sometimes the shouting ones need to return.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They need to walk backward.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But sometimes those who are so quiet also need to return.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They need to walk backward and to shout.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The problem is this: neither the shouting ones nor the quiet ones are willing to walk backward.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The shouters always shout.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The quiet ones are always quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Each must learn to walk backward.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The shouters need to learn to be quiet, and the quiet ones need to learn to shout.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the others must learn to walk sideways.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By this practice, we will never have any kind of division in our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>WALKING BACKWARD AND SIDEWAYS</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need not only to walk straightforward, but also to walk backward.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We also must learn to walk sideways to the right and sideways to the left.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This will cause us to be really coordinated.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is easy to speak in this way, but not easy to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What does it mean to walk backward?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is to say "Amen" to another's ministry and to another's burden.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is not to say "Amen" to your own ministry, but "Amen" to another's ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>While one brother is walking straightforward and you are walking backward, you must say "Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means "Amen" to his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To walk sideways is also to say "Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The problem today is that in all the local churches, we have too many turns.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We do not have the backward walk or the sideways walk.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is very difficult to help the churches to learn to walk sideways.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Few are willing to walk in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In one local church, a good brother was responsible for the cleaning service group.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He did a good job, but he was always hunting for the strong brothers and the capable sisters to join his cleaning service group.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He did not care for outreach or for the building up.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He only cared for his cleaning service group.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Eventually, this caused a problem in that local church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By this you can see that it is easy for us to cause a division, but it is hard for us to have the proper and real coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We all must learn to keep our position and to go straightforward.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We also must learn to walk backward, saying "Amen" to another's position and ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, we must learn to walk sideways to the right and sideways to the left.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need these four kinds of walks: the straightforward walk, the backward walk, the sideways walk to the right, and the sideways walk to the left.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we have not learned these four kinds of walks, eventually we will become a problem to our local church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If the young people do not learn to have this kind of walk, eventually they will cause problems in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The more they grow and learn, the more they will be able to function and to minister, and the more problems they will cause.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is because they only know how to walk straightforward and to have some turn.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But remember, there is no turning in the proper coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is no turning to the left or to the right.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is only the straightforward walk, the backward walk, the sideways walk to the right, and the sideways walk to the left.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We all must learn to walk in these four ways.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>FOLLOWING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you are the one who is walking straightforward, you must be very careful to walk according to the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Ezekiel 1:12 says, "whither the Spirit was to go, they went."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To follow the Spirit is not the business of the other three, but the business of the one who is walking straightforward.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The one who is walking straightforward must be careful to follow the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Otherwise, the coordination will be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is right that a brother should have a fishing ministry and that another brother should have a mending ministry, but there must be the leading of the Spirit as to whether this is the time to have the fishing or the mending.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If now is the time for the church to follow and take care of the fishing ministry, that brother must take the lead under the guidance of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The whole church must follow and be one with that brother.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>While the fishing ministry is going on, those who have the mending ministry or other ministries must coordinate by walking backward or sideways.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must all learn this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Sometimes brothers need to take the lead to move in a certain direction.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But because they are humanly and naturally humble, they hesitate and do not lead in a bold way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This causes the church to be delayed and to have no direction for going on.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>At other times one who should not be leading takes the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This damages the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When you should take the lead, do it boldly.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When others take the lead, learn to walk backward or sideways.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This will enable the church to go on.</S>
