   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR ENJOYING CHRIST BY CALLING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ON THE NAME OF THE LORD Scripture Reading: Acts 2:17a, 21; Rom 10:6b-9, 12-13; Acts 9:14; 2 Tim 2:22; 1 Cor 1:2, 9, 24; 12:3, 13 EXPRESSING GOD AND CONQUERING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>HIS ENEMY IN OUR DAILY LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have seen that God's purpose is to express Himself and to conquer His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whatever we do in our Christian life must be for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Let us use the illustration of wives submitting themselves to their own husbands Eph 5:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even in this matter, there are these two aspects: expressing God and conquering God's enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If a sister who is a wife would not be willing to submit herself to her husband, this kind of rebellion would be a glory to Satan and a shame to God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But if the dear sister would be willing and able to submit herself to her own husband, this would be a glory to God and a shame to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When a sister submits herself by enjoying the Lord within her, spontaneously she expresses God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God is expressed in her submission, and spontaneously Satan is conquered.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The enemy, the devil, the evil one, is subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If a wife and husband are fighting each other, God is put to shame.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God is not expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But if a sister submits to her husband out of her enjoyment of Christ, you can see Christ expressed in her submission.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even in the smallest things in our daily walk, we need to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we enjoy the Lord day by day, we will be dealt with by the Lord in the way that we dress.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Something in us will be touched.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When you are calling on the Lord, the Lord may say, "What kind of tie is this that you are wearing?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As you are combing your hair, the Lord would say, "How will you comb your hair?"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord will touch us in these little things as we remain in the fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually, the way we dress will be the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even in our dress, the enemy, the evil one, will be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the way that some people dress, you can see the darkness of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Everything of our daily walk is either the expression of God or the expression of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Either the enemy is subdued or he is prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But we also need to remember that the Christian life is not a matter of outward correction.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Outward correction is not something of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is like the work of morticians, the work of outward decoration.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They can make a corpse look presentable outwardly, but this is not the transformation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The transformation of life comes from within.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As we call on the Lord, pray to Him, and pray-read His word, we enjoy Christ as life, and this life transforms us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we do everything in our daily life by enjoying the Lord, whatever we do will be the expression of God and the subduing of His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Suppose another brother rebuked you, and yet you were so patient with him, without losing your temper, by the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Others would be able to realize the expression of Christ and the conquering of the enemy with you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But this should not be your doing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This must be Christ's doing through your enjoyment of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Do not try to do anything by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Never try to express God by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Never try to conquer, to subdue, the enemy by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you try to conquer him, be sure that you will be conquered.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We can never face our enemy, because we are not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But praise Him, we have Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ must get into us as our life so that He can live Himself through us.</S>
