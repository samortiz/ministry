<h1 class="title">ONE ACCORD IN THE LORD&rsquo;S MOVE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 1:14; 2:46; 4:32; Rom. 15:5-6; 1 Cor. 1:10; Phil. 1:27; 2:2; 4:2; 1 Tim. 1:3-4; 6:3; 2 Tim. 1:15; Rev. 1:4-5a</h1>
<p>The one accord is the base, the ground, for our present practice in the Lord&rsquo;s move. Anything that we do, teach, or practice must be absolutely according to the holy Word, which is God&rsquo;s completed revelation. The very great, particular characteristic in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to do everything according to the Bible. The matter of being in one accord in the New Testament occupies a very crucial stand for the Lord&rsquo;s move.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONSUMMATED SPIRIT AND<br />
THE ONE ACCORD</h2>
<p>Many Christians have seen that in the Lord&rsquo;s move the biggest factor is the Holy Spirit. The Spirit, who is the biggest factor in the Lord&rsquo;s move in the New Testament today, after the Lord&rsquo;s ascension, is the consummated Spirit, the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God. The Spirit poured out from the heavens upon the believers in Acts was not merely the Spirit of God as He was in Genesis 1:2 or merely the Holy Spirit as He was in Matthew 1:18 and 20. In Genesis 1:2 the Spirit of God brooded over the condemned and judged earth. Through His brooding the creation in God&rsquo;s plan was brought in. In the Old Testament the Spirit was very much involved with God&rsquo;s old creation.</p>
<p>In the New Testament is the Holy Spirit. In Matthew 1 this Holy Spirit got involved with something deeper. The Holy Spirit was involved, not in the outward, objective creation but in the inward, subjective incarnation. This incarnation is the Triune God conceived in a human being, and the very element to carry this out was the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit was not only the means to carry out the incarnation but also the element and essence. To have any conception there is the need of two basic elements with two basic essences. Without these two essences, no conception could be carried out. To carry out the divine conception of Jesus there was the need of two essences&mdash;the divine essence and the human essence. The divine essence was the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus, who was God incarnate, lived on this earth for thirty-three and a half years and died on the cross to accomplish a full and eternal redemption by dying an all-inclusive death with seven statuses. Then He passed through the tomb and descended into Hades (Acts 2:27). He was resurrected out of death and Hades, and in resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). On the day of His resurrection in the evening, He breathed Himself into His disciples for them to receive the Holy Breath, the Holy Spirit. By that time, the very Triune God had been wrought into the disciples.</p>
<p>After His resurrection, He stayed with the disciples for forty days, and then He met the disciples on a mountain, telling them that all authority had been given to Him in heaven and on earth. He charged them to go and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (Matt. 28:16-19). By that time, after His resurrection and His breathing of the Spirit into the disciples, He could tell the disciples to baptize the nations into the name, into the completed Person, of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</p>
<p>The name of the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, implies a lot. We should not merely know the Triune God by a term in Matthew 28:19. We have to realize the full implication of this all-inclusive title&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. It implies God&rsquo;s incarnation, Jesus&rsquo; conception and birth. It implies Jesus&rsquo; human living on this earth and His all-inclusive death on the cross. It also includes His being in the tomb, in Hades, and in death, and His coming back to the earth through resurrection to become a life-giving Spirit. After this He ascended to the heavens, fully accomplishing the very process for the Triune God to go through to be the consummated Spirit. He then poured out this Spirit, and this Spirit poured out of the Triune God from the heavens became the strongest factor, on the Lord&rsquo;s side, of His move on this earth.</p>
<p>On one side, God&rsquo;s move depends upon Himself as the consummated Spirit. He needs us as the other side so there could be the possibility of accomplishment. If we do not render Him any kind of cooperation or give Him any kind of response, nothing can happen, regardless of how powerful, dynamic, and mighty the Holy Spirit of the Triune God can be. God can do the work of creation by Himself but not the work of the new creation. The new creation work must be carried out in the principle of incarnation, the principle of God being one with man, making one entity out of two elements with no third element produced. The Holy Spirit is the power, the means, and the factor for God&rsquo;s move on this earth, but that is just on one side. There is the need of another side, the human side. There is the need of another factor&mdash;the one accord.</p>
<p>If there had been no one accord on the earth in Acts 1, the powerful and dynamic Spirit could have never been poured out. There would have been no vessels to take Him, receive Him, contain Him, and express Him. Thus, the one accord is critical. It is a response to God&rsquo;s doing, a coordination or cooperation offered to God for His move. The Lord&rsquo;s move on God&rsquo;s side depends upon the consummated Spirit and on our side depends upon one accord. Before the pouring out of the Spirit, there was a group of people praying together with one accord (Acts 1:14). That one accord was a preparation for them to receive the pouring out of the Spirit. After this pouring out, they remained and continued in this one accord along with the three thousand saved on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:46). This one accord was the basic factor of the Lord&rsquo;s move through the entire book of Acts.</p>
<p>Romans is a book on the principles of the Christian life and the church life, yet in 15:6 it charges us with the same thing&mdash;one accord. If there is no one accord, it is hard for the church to go on, and it is hard to have the church life. In 1 Corinthians Paul speaks of the one accord again, telling the Corinthians to &ldquo;speak the same thing&rdquo; (1:10). In Philippians we are charged strongly and repeatedly that for the proper experience of Christ in the proper church life, the one accord surely is needed (1:27; 2:2; 4:2). The one accord means one mind and one will with one purpose, wrapped up with our soul and heart.</p>
<p>The matter of one accord controls the entire revelation concerning the Lord&rsquo;s move on one side. If there were no Spirit on the Lord&rsquo;s side, it would be impossible for the Lord to move on this earth at all. In the same principle, without the one accord on our side, God cannot move. We have to match God. He is now the consummated Spirit, and we have to say, &ldquo;Lord, we are ready here as the very one accord. We want to not only render but we are also ready to offer to You this one accord.&rdquo; Immediately there is a kind of marriage, and a couple comes out. Then anything can be done.</p>
