   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Creator and a Creature</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Colossians 1:12 tells us that Christ is God's allotted portion to us, and verse 15 says that this Christ is "the image of the invisible God, the Firstborn of all creation."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God is the Creator, and Christ is the image of the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As such a One, He is surely divine.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is also the Firstborn of all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This indicates that He is also a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since He became a man with blood and flesh Heb 2:14 , surely He is a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, He is both divine and human.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is God and He is also a man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is the Creator and He is also a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ as the Son of Man</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Sitting on the Throne in Heaven</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many do not know that after His resurrection and ascension Christ still has His humanity, and others would strongly disagree, saying that Christ is no longer a man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, Matthew 26:63-64 reveals clearly that He is still a man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When He was being judged by the Sanhedrin, they charged Him: "Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In answering Jesus said, "You will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today Christ as the Son of Man is sitting on the throne in heaven, and He will come again also as the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ's being a man is altogether related to God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His humanity, therefore, means a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He has been exalted by God as a man, and as a glorified man He is now sitting in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At this point, I would ask you to consider a hymn on His exaltation as a man Hymns, #132 :</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Lo! in heaven Jesus sitting,</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ the Lord is there enthroned;</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As the man by God exalted,</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>With God's glory He is crowned.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He hath put on human nature,</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Died according to God's plan,</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Resurrected with a body,</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>And ascended as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God in Him on earth was humbled,</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God with man was domiciled;</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Man in Him in heav'n exalted,</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Man with God is reconciled.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He as God with man is mingled,</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God in man is testified;</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He as man with God is blended,</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Man in God is glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>From the Glorified in heaven</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The inclusive Spirit came;</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All of Jesus' work and Person</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Doth this Spirit here proclaim.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>With the Glorified in heaven</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Is the Church identified;</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By the Spirit of this Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Are His members edified.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Lo! a man is now in heaven</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As the Lord of all enthroned;</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is Jesus Christ our Savior,</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>With God's glory ever crowned!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I would call your attention to the lines which say that the church is identified with the "the Glorified in heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ has been glorified and exalted as a man, and we are identified with Him.</S>
