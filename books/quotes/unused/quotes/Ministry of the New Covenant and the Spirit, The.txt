Although he may act like an old man in the theater, he still lives the life of a twenty-year-old man in his actual living
The ministry of the new covenant is the living of the new covenant, and the living of the new covenant is the ministry of the new covenant
It is quite amazing, however, that the New Testament does not begin with the law of Moses but with the genealogy and origin of Jesus Christ
The Gospel of John also reveals that the Word who was God and who became flesh is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world
When the disciples came together to meet in the evening on the Lord's Day, the Lord Jesus appeared to them again
Not only is the Lord with us when we are praying and reading the Bible but even if we go back to the world to fish the Lord will go with us
The point of my fellowship is that in the New Testament there are no regulations or rules; there is only the living Lord Jesus
Today when we serve God in the new covenant, we should serve not according to doctrines but according to the living Spirit
When you arrive at the meeting hall, you sit quietly and wait until a responsible brother calls a hymn before you sing
The entire New Testament talks about the Spirit and reveals that the Spirit eventually becomes the seven Spirits
Although we have left the sects, denominations, and old Christianity, we have formed a new religion-a self-religion
Today as we are serving God in the new covenant to fulfill our ministry, we should not be in the realm of doctrine and the letter
We may say that we love and serve the living Lord and that we fellowship with Him, but in actuality we may be religious people
Where the blood is applied, the ointment is applied, and where there is the precious blood, there is the Holy Spirit
When we come to meet, we should not care for the letter or for regulations; we should care only for the living Spirit
As a mirror we reflect the glory of the Lord and are transformed into the image of the Lord from glory to glory
If we have sufficient funds but lack the intelligence to manage a company, we will not be able to accomplish anything
Christ becomes wisdom to us as righteousness for our past, as sanctification for our present, and as redemption for our future
Praise the Lord that the all-inclusive Christ, who is so full, has become the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit who gives life
As the Spirit He is also the foundation the Passover our spiritual food drink and rock the Head the Body the first the second and the last
In other words, if we simply say, 'Lord Jesus,' we will be in the Holy Spirit and will also drink of this Spirit
Similarly, we are already in the Lord, so if we want to drink of the Lord, the way to do so is to open our 'window'
When they go to work in the morning, they wear gospel robes, and while driving to work, they shout, 'Jesus is Lord'!
They walk around the campus wearing gospel robes, they eat in the cafeteria wearing gospel robes, and they come home wearing gospel robes
May the Lord have mercy on us and cause us to see that our Lord is not a religion, a doctrine, a teaching, or a ritual
When we wake up in the morning, we may be busy, and we may not have the opportunity to kneel down and have a time with the Lord
When we walk according to Him, we will have a spiritual living, and we will experience Christ in a practical way
In order to make progress in spiritual matters, we need to learn to go deeper into them and to touch them in a deep and detailed way
Within our body we have something that is most precious, something that neither scientists nor medical doctors are able to locate
Thessalonians 5:23 says, 'And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete'
When we get angry to such an extent, we forget about our rationality, our face, and our relationship with others
In God's economy, which is God's way to accomplish His work, first, God is the Father; second, He is the Son; and third, He is the Spirit
After the Lord Jesus accomplished everything on the cross, God's plan of redemption is still a matter of the Spirit
The Lord is Spirit, and as the Spirit, He enters into and lives in our spirit, causing us to be joined to Him as one spirit
Our body is an outward organ for contacting the physical world, and our spirit is an inward organ for contacting the spiritual world
Originally, our spirit is merely an organ, but when Christ comes into our spirit, He comes into us as a person
Now that the Lord has entered into our spirit to become the life of our spirit, our spirit has become a person
Today we have two persons within us-our soul is the old man, the outer man, and our spirit is our new person, the inner man
On the one hand, we cannot deny that it is a blessing that we are saved, for the Lord has come into us as a genuine treasure
Ephesians 3:16-17 says that we need to be strengthened with power into the inner man that Christ may make His home in our hearts
Today the Lord Jesus is inside of us, but will He be able to possess our whole being, or will we force Him to stay only in our spirit?
While the sister is preparing to go out and buy the dress, the Lord Jesus may come to interfere with her plans
He prayed that we would be strengthened into the inner man, so that as a result the Lord Jesus would be able to make His home in our hearts
When the Lord Jesus gains the ground in every part of our being, He will then be able to make His home in our hearts
The result of this increase and decrease will be that we no longer live but that Christ lives in us as our person
The work to install the lights is rough, but inside a light bulb itself, there is a filament that is very delicate
Sin defiled our conscience, which is the most important part of our spirit, and as a result, our spirit became deadened
When a light bulb's filament burns out, the light bulb is insulated, disconnected, from its supply of electricity
When we repent and believe into Him, His precious blood washes away our sins, and the Lord, who is the Spirit, contacts our spirit
Neither the oil nor the flour changed-the two remained the same-but the two were mingled together to become one
Similar to the mingling of oil with fine flour, God has come into us and has been mingled with us to become one
If fine flour is without oil, it is hard and dry, but if oil is added to flour and mingled with it, the flour becomes soft and moist
As we call, 'O Lord, Amen,' more oil is added into us, we are mingled with the Lord more, and we become more moist and less dry within
Originally, our spirit was by itself, but now the Spirit has been added to our spirit, joined to our spirit, and mingled with our spirit
Praise the Lord that these two spirits-the divine Spirit and the human spirit-have been mingled to become one spirit
The divine Spirit has been mingled with the human spirit, and our human spirit has been mingled with the divine Spirit
When you pray with your spirit, on the one hand, you are praying; on the other hand, the Lord is praying within your spirit
When you sing hymns of praise to the Lord, however, you will feel something encouraging you from within and motivating you to praise
In this case, when you are praising, the Lord is also praising, and when you are singing, the Lord is also singing
Andrew Murray was the most spiritual person at the end of the nineteenth century and beginning of the twentieth century
One time he said that the best and highest prayer is the Christ within us praying to the Christ sitting on the throne in the heavens
In the end, one of the two will throw their chopsticks on the floor, and the two will begin to fight verbally and maybe even physically
There are many people, things, and matters around us that are placed there to tempt us and to stir up our mind
As they are picking up a pair of shoes, the One within them will tell them to drop the shoes; if they call, 'O Lord'!
As they are taking a skirt off of a rack of clothes, the One within them will tell them to put the skirt back; if they call, 'O Lord'!
When they come to the meeting that evening, their spirit will be strong, and their speaking will be full of strength
In such a situation he should not use his mouth to talk to his wife; rather, he should use it to open himself to the Lord
After reading this message you all should be very clear but tomorrow morning when your wife gives you a long face you may forget everything
If you continue to look at her long face with your eyes and listen to her grumbling with your ears, you will fall into Satan's trap
We should not listen to the old talk in Christianity which says that we should look to the Lord who is in heaven
If we do, we may look to the Lord to give us love, knowing that we cannot love our wife and that only the Lord can cause us to love her
Initially, the spirit is limited within the spirit, but by spreading into our mind, the spirit becomes the spirit of our mind
When the spirit of our mind saturates our entire being, all of our thoughts, feelings, and concepts will be completely changed
