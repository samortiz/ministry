Six hundred copies have been sold to Peking, Tientsin, Chefoo, K'un-ming, Hunan, and our bookstore. Issue No. 14 of The Christian is now being typeset, but the `Bible Study' column is not here yet. Brother Stephen Kaung and Sister Shen Hwei-min were married at the YMCA in Ba-Shien Bridge on July 30. Brother Chang Kwang-rong and Sister Miao Yun-chun are still in Shanghai. Because of her mother's illness, Sister Miao cannot go to the north as planned."</p><p>(2) Brother K. H. Weigh wrote on July 22 from K'un-ming: "Brother Watchman Nee's wife and mother arrived here on the nineteenth. May the Lord use them."</p><p>(3) According to a letter dated July 12 from Ning-Hai in Chekiang, Sister Tu Yun-sien's wound has been healed, but she still cannot walk on her right foot.</p><p>(4) Sister Wang Yien-tse returned to Kulangsu according to a letter of August 5.</p><p>(5) The local meeting in Peking is presently in Brother Hsiao Lu-yuen's and Sister Lin Shu-yun's house, according to a letter dated July 29.</p><p>(6) According to a letter in July from Er-Mei, Sister Shen Ma Min-shiu is returning to Ch'eng-tu around August 10.</p><p>(7) Brother Stephen Kaung wrote to Tang Shou-ling: "On August 8 I left Shanghai for Hong Kong. If I have the guidance from the Lord, I may go to Szechuan through Hunan and Hankow. Because I could not get a ticket in Kwangtung, I returned to Hong Kong. The trip to Szechuan will have to be cancelled temporarily."</p><p>(8) According to a letter sent by Brother Kuo Bu-yueh to Lan Tsi-yi, he felt clear to go through Hong Kong and Shanghai and to return north to Chefoo. Then he will go to Tientsin and Peking. But before that he will have to go with Sister Tso Fu-ru to Kweilin first.</p><p>(9) Sisters Ma Min-jen and Ji Hwei-jen left Yi to go to Chungking.</p><h2 class="head1">LAST MINUTE NEWS</h2><p>From July 25 to 31 there was a conference in Ch'ang-sha. The Lord's servant, Brother Tang Shou-ling, spoke on the subject of "The Glory of Christ." The result was good. Many brothers and sisters were revived in life and had a turn. Thank the Lord. Beginning August 8 there was a sisters' conference on the subject of "The Will of God." There were two meetings every day. What was released met the real need of the sisters in Ch'ang-sha. May the Lord bless these messages. Sister Tso's footsteps have not been decided yet. She has moved into a sister's house. Mail can be directed to the meeting hall.</p><p>Brothers Yang Dai and Kuo Jen-yung, August 12</p><h2 class="head1">THE WHEREABOUTS OF THE SAINTS<br />IN HANKOW, HUNAN, AND CH'ANG-SHA</h2><p>[Omitted]</p><h2 class="head1">A FEW REMINDERS</h2><p>(1) Whenever a brother or sister changes his or her address, please inform us of the new address in detail, as well as his or her condition, so that we can publish them in this paper. This will relieve the concern of many.</p><p>(2) Many local churches are meeting in the homes of the saints. Saints who arrive in a new locality can look up the address of any brother or sister in that city listed in this paper, and can find the meeting place accordingly.</p><p>(3) If the brothers and sisters move to a locality without a meeting, they should meet by themselves, even if there are only two or three, because the Scripture says, "Not abandoning our own assembling together...but exhorting one another; and so much the more as you see the day drawing near" (Heb. 10:25). The Lord Himself promised that "where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst" (Matt. 18:20). We also hope that wherever the footsteps of our brothers and sisters are, the opportunity for men to hear the gospel is also present.</p><p>(4) If brothers or sisters want this paper mailed directly to them, please write to us. Otherwise, please receive your copy from your local church.</p><p>(5) Of the co-workers and local churches that we know of, none have solicited relief funds or raised money for the need of the work or the local churches. We wish to maintain the same nature by the grace of the Lord.</p><p>(6) At this critical hour we need to practice the words of Hebrews 13:1-3: "Let brotherly love continue. Do not forget hospitality....Remember those...who are ill treated as being yourselves also likewise treated in body."</p><p>Ruth Lee in Wan County, August 15</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_037.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_039.html">Next</a> </body></html>
