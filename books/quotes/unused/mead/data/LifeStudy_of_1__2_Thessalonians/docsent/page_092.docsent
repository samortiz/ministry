   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND THESSALONIANS MESSAGE ONE A WORD OF ENCOURAGEMENT Scripture Reading: 2 Thes 1:1-12</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The opening of 2 Thessalonians is very much like that of 1 Thessalonians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1:1 and 2 Paul says, "Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This Epistle and the First Epistle of Paul to the Thessalonians were both addressed to the local church in Thessalonica, a city of the Roman Empire in the province of Macedonia, north of the province of Achaia.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This church was composed of all the believers in Christ in that city.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Such a local church is of the believers and is in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This indicates that such a local church is born of God the Father with His life and nature and is united with the Lord Jesus Christ organically in all He is and has done.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the one hand, it is of human beings, in this case the Thessalonians; on the other hand, it is in God and in the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The organic union in the divine life and nature is the vital base for the believers to live a holy life for the church life, which is the theme of the two Epistles to the Thessalonians.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In chapter one of 1 Thessalonians we see the structure of a holy life for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This structure is composed of faith, love, and hope.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As we shall see, 2 Thessalonians also has the same structure.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>ENCOURAGEMENT AND CORRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Second Thessalonians is a book of encouragement and correction.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The young believers in Christ at Thessalonica needed further encouragement; they also needed some correction.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul encouraged these believers in his first Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nevertheless, in the second Epistle he gives them a further word of encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>While he is encouraging them, he also corrects them in certain matters.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Actually, 2 Thessalonians is more a book of correction than a book of encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul was wise, gentle, and kind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, he does not directly give a word of correction.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Rather, first he encourages the believers and then goes on to correct them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we read this Epistle carefully, we shall see that a word of encouragement is followed by a word of correction.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then there is some further word of encouragement and after that another word of correction.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This book, therefore, is composed of two sections of encouragement and two of correction, in addition to the introduction and the conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this message let us consider Paul's first word of encouragement to the believers at Thessalonica.</S>
