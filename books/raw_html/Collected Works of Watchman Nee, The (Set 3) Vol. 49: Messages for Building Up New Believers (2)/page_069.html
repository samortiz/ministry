<h2 class="head2">C. Virginity Being Related to<br />the Kingdom of the Heavens and to Rapture</h2><p>Those who keep their virginity have much to gain before the Lord. Matthew 19 clearly shows that it is easier for a virgin to enter the kingdom of the heavens. We have to acknowledge that "there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs because of the kingdom of the heavens." Matthew 19 clearly speaks of the relationship between virginity and the kingdom of the heavens. We dare not say specifically what relationship there is between virginity and the kingdom of the heavens. However, we can say that keeping one's virginity definitely has its advantage in entering the kingdom of the heavens. The Lord tells us here that there are some who made themselves eunuchs, who keep their virginity for the sake of the kingdom of the heavens.</p><p>This is not all. Revelation 14 shows us that the firstfruits (the hundred and forty-four thousand) are virgins. They follow the Lamb wherever He may go. These hundred and forty-four thousand are the early raptured ones. Virginity definitely has something to do with rapture. We will find one day that virgins have a clear advantage in entering the kingdom of the heavens and in being raptured. What about today? Paul said that keeping one's virginity indeed reduces afflictions and enables a person to serve God well.</p><p>We can only present these facts to the brothers and sisters. Only those who do not have a compulsion for sex, who are firm in their heart, and who find adequate provisions in their environment can keep their virginity. We are presenting this matter in an objective and biblical way before the brothers and sisters. Everyone should make his or her own choice before the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. MARRIAGE PARTNERS</h2><p>Concerning the matter of marriage, God has laid down definite guidelines on whom one can marry and whom one cannot marry. The Bible shows us clearly that the marriages of God's people should be restricted to those among themselves only. In other words, if one is to be married, his spouse must be sought from among God's own people, not from other people.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Old Testament Commandments</h2><p>There are sufficient commandments in the Old Testament to show us that we should not marry anyone outside of God's people.</p><p>Deuteronomy 7:3-4 says that the Israelites should not marry the Canaanites. They should neither give their daughters to the Canaanites' sons, nor take their daughters for their sons, because the Canaanites would turn them from following the Lord and would seduce them to serve other gods. God clearly shows through the Old Testament that one should look for a marriage partner among the Lord's people. One cannot look for a wife or a husband among unbelievers. The greatest problem with going after unbelievers is that the other person may turn one away from the Lord to serve other gods. It is easy for wives to follow their husbands to worship idols. It is also easy for husbands to follow their wives to worship idols. Since both are married, it is very easy for one to follow the other to worship other gods.</p><p>Joshua 23:12-13 warns the Israelites against marrying the people of the land. They were warned that the latter would become snares and thorns in their eyes. Their wives or their husbands would become their thorns, and they would be ensnared.</p><p>At the time of Nehemiah, the Israelites returned from captivity to the land of Judah. Many had married Gentile wives and could not speak the Hebrew language. Nehemiah charged them in 13:23-27 to sever all ties with the Gentile women and not to have any dealings with them. Here we see a basic problem in marrying a Gentile woman: Sooner or later the children will follow the mother and not follow the father to serve God. If you marry a Gentile, your children will easily follow your Gentile partner and go into the world. This is quite a problem.</p><p>Malachi 2:11 shows us that the Israelites committed treacherous sins and profaned the holiness of God because they took Gentiles to be their wives. In God's sight, marrying a Gentile woman is to profane the holiness of God. Hence, Christians should look for marriage partners only among the believers.</p><p>We can also take warnings from the failure of Solomon. Solomon was the wisest king, yet he fell into idolatry through marrying Gentile women.</p>
