   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SEVEN FACTORS IN SPIRITUAL ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"One Body and one Spirit, even as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all" Eph 4:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A person is constituted a member of the Church on the ground that he possesses the oneness of the Spirit, and that will result in his being one with all believers on the above seven points.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They are the seven elements in the oneness of the Spirit, which is the common heritage of all the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In drawing a line of demarcation between those who belong to the Church and those who do not, we must require nothing beyond these seven lest we exclude any who belong to the family of God; and we dare not require anything less, lest we include any who do not belong to the divine family.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All in whom these seven are found belong to the Church; all who lack any of them do not belong to the Church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>1 ONE BODY.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The question of oneness begins with the question of membership of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The sphere of our fellowship is the sphere of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those who are outside that sphere have no spiritual relationship with us, but those who are inside that sphere are all in fellowship with us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We cannot make any choice of fellowship in the Body, accepting some members and rejecting others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are all part of the one Body, and nothing can possibly separate us from it, or from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Anyone who has received Christ belongs to the Body, and he and we are one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we do not wish to extend fellowship to anyone, we must first make sure that he does not belong to the Body; if he does, we have no reason to reject him unless for such disciplinary reasons as are clearly laid down in the Word of God .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>2 ONE SPIRIT.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If anyone seeks fellowship with us, however he may differ from us in experience or outlook, provided he has the same Spirit as we have, he is entitled to be received as a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If he has received the Spirit of Christ, and we have received the Spirit of Christ, then we are one in the Lord, and nothing must divide us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>3 ONE HOPE.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This hope, which is common to all the children of God, is not a general hope, but the hope of our calling, that is, the hope of our calling as Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What is our hope as Christians?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We hope to be with the Lord forever in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is not a single soul who is truly the Lord's in whose heart there is not this hope, for to have Christ in us is to have "the hope of glory" in us Col 1:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If anyone claims to be the Lord's, but has no hope of heaven or glory, his is a mere empty profession.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All who share this one hope are one, and since we have the hope of being together in glory for all eternity, how can we be divided in time?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we are going to share the same future, shall we not gladly share the same present?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>4 ONE LORD.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is only one Lord, the Lord Jesus, and all who recognize that God has made Jesus of Nazareth to be both Lord and Christ are one in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If anyone confesses Jesus to be Lord, then his Lord is our Lord, and since we serve the same Lord, nothing whatever can separate us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>5 ONE FAITH.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The faith here spoken of is the faith not our beliefs in regard to the interpretation of Scripture, but the faith through which we have been saved, which is the common possession of all believers; that is, the faith that Jesus is the Son of God who died for the salvation of sinners and lives again to give life to the dead .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Anyone who lacks this vital faith does not belong to the Lord, but all who possess it are the Lord's. The children of God may follow many different lines of scriptural interpretation, but in regard to this fundamental faith they are one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those who lack this faith have no part in the family of God, but all who possess it we recognize as our brothers in the Lord.</S>
