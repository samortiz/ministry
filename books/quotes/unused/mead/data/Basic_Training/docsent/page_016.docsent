   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Chapter Four SONSHIP FOR THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall cover the matter of sonship for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians 1:5 says that God has predestinated "us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God has predestinated us for sonship; His predestination results in sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, sonship is according to God's predestination.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before the foundation of the world, God marked us out for sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We were not saved by accident but according to God's predestination.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A CONSTITUTION OF THE SONS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Ephesians 1 does not end with sonship, for the last verse of this chapter v. 23 speaks of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Body is the result of the sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God has predestinated us for sonship so that the Body may come into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you read Ephesians 1 carefully and thoroughly, you will see that the Body is constituted of the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Body is not composed of Americans, Chinese, and various other nationalities.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All these nationalities are the sons of men, and sons of men cannot compose the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many Christians think that the Body is simply the coming together of groups of believers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Such a gathering may be an organization or a society, but it is not the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Body of Christ is not composed of sons of man, for they are not qualified to be the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only the sons of God are qualified to be constituted into the living organism known as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From now on, we should no longer consider the Body as simply a group of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to ask whether these Christians are meeting as sons of God or merely as sons of man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all have a dual status.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the one hand, we are still sons of man; on the other hand, we are sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If I were in the status of a son of man, I would not be able to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When I speak for Him, I speak as a son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After we become sons of God, we need to live like sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How about your living?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do you live like a son of God?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When you deal with your wife or husband, are you a son of man or a son of God?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we still live like sons of man, we are not the Body of Christ in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Apparently, we are the Body of Christ; actually, all the demons know that we are not the Body of Christ but simply a gathering of sons of man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Moreover, the angels will say that because we still live like sons of man, they do not recognize us as sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order to claim the standing of the Body of Christ, we must live like the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then we have the ground to declare to all the universe, "We are the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Angels, don't you see that we are living here as the sons of God?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Demons, none of us is living like the sons of man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hallelujah, we have been chosen and predestinated to be sons of God in order to be constituted into the Body of Christ!"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A SON DENOTING LIFE FOR OUR LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the Bible a son has two crucial significances.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First, a son denotes life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>First John 5:12 says, "He who has the Son has the life."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, if you do not have the Son, you do not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A son of man denotes the human life, and the Son of God denotes the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although we were born with the human life, through regeneration we have received the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By this divine life with the divine nature, we are no longer merely sons of man but also sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Fifty years ago, I thought that to have life through having the Son meant only that we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Yes, when we have eternal life by having the Son, we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Life, however, is not mainly for salvation; it is for our living.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The divine life we have through receiving the Son of God is for our living.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Are you living like a divine person?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even the teenagers among us need to realize that because they have the Son of God, the divine life is in them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This divine life is for living, and they need to live like divine persons.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need to say, "O Lord Jesus, have mercy on me.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although I have the divine life, I'm not living like a divine person."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is abnormal to have the divine life and not to live like a divine person.</S>
