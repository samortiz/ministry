   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>On November 21, 1916, there were two students in a girls' school in Peking.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The last name of one was Yang and the other's was Liao.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They stayed in school and cooked for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to save money, they bought a big vat of alcohol instead of buying a small quantity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Each time after using it, they would melt wax and seal the opening.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Due to their carelessness one day, a spark dropped into the alcohol and their whole house caught on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They both ran out of the house.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Realizing that their purse was left inside the house, they ran back to get it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Consequently, the fire burned their entire bodies, and eventually they died.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All the students in the school who saw their pitiful condition wept bitterly for them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the day I read the news in the newspaper, I could not help shedding my tears with them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why did these two die?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They died because there were a few dollars in their purse.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>O money!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>O money!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How many human lives you have taken!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The fire of hell is approaching fast.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You have the opportunity to be saved today; do not lose your soul for the sake of a little money.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many people take risks, thinking they might gain riches and, at the same time, hold on to their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Let me ask you: since you know this is a risk, why take it?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once a ship hit a rock and started to sink.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The owner of the ship said to the sailors, "Please get the life boat ready.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I will go down below the deck to take care of a certain matter and come back right away."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Why did he go down into the ship's hold?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He had a great deal of money in the safe and did not want to let it sink with the ship into the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At that dangerous time, he still took a risk to get the money.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The ship sank little by little while he was trying to get the money.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The ship sank inch by inch while he was still trying to get the money.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The ship sank faster than he was able to get his money, so when the sailors saw that he was not coming, they lowered the lifeboat and fled for their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the end the owner did not come.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He tried to leave when the water reached his feet, but it was too late and he drowned.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Later, when the ship was recovered from the sea, the owner was holding the key to the safe in one hand and clutching a handful of gold coins in the other.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He got the money but he lost his life and perished!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Is money or life better?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Covetousness sent the owner of that ship to hell; therefore, be careful, lest your covetous heart also sends you to that place of eternal suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here is similar story.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Once a ship was sinking, and everyone on board the ship fled for their lives, not caring for their belongings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One sailor was reluctant to see their wealth go down in the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He was also reluctant to lose his life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, he put the best lifesaver around his chest and said to himself, "Now my life is safe; I can spend a little time to make an unexpected fortune."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He went into the hold and searched for gold and money, and actually found a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then he took a big piece of cloth, wrapped up the gold coins and bills, tied it around his waist, and ran up to the deck.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By this time the ship had almost sunk.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He had no more time to lose so he jumped into the sea, hoping that he could float and wait for someone to pick him up.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When he jumped into the sea, to his surprise he did not float on the water; rather, he went straight down to the bottom of the sea like a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Did his lifesaver lose its function?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Why did he sink?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He sank because the gold coins were too heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The lifesaver was able to save him, but not able to save him and the gold coins.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I hope all of the Christians here will be attentive.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Nominally speaking, you may be believers in Christ, but I do not know whether or not you have really believed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Believing in Christ and covetousness are mutually exclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Do not think, "I want to get rich, but I also want to believe in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is true that Christ can save you.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But Christ cannot save you if you do not get rid of your desire to become rich.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christ can save sinners into heaven, but Christ cannot save sinners who take their sins with them into heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Either leave your sin of covetousness outside of heaven, or you and your covetous sin will be left outside of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Among those sitting here today, is there anyone who does not believe in Christ because he is hindered by money?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is true that we were covetous in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But Christ has died for all our sins; therefore, Christ has also borne our sin of covetousness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Although you have been a very covetous person in the past, you will surely be saved if you are willing to believe in Christ as your Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There is no sin in the world that is too grievous or beyond Christ's saving ability.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Christ can save us from all sins, regardless of the type of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He died for all our sins and bore the punishment we deserve for our sins; therefore, everyone who is willing to believe in Him can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Do not be mistaken, however.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Although the sin of covetousness is not the direct cause of perishing, a covetous heart is an indirect cause of perishing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Christ has died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we believe in Christ, God cannot cause us to perish for any sin.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Therefore, the sin of covetousness means nothing because it has been judged in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But what about a covetous heart?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is very powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It can prevent you from believing in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It can make you love money more than you love your soul.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It can make you seek exclusively for the wealth of the world, so that you have no heart to seek after the heavenly blessing and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>For the sake of worldly treasure, it can make you lose the taste for spiritual living.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Therefore, you will not believe in Christ because of your covetousness.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If you believe in Christ, all your sins, not just covetousness, will be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Believing in Jesus Christ as your personal Savior is the only way for you to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If you do not believe in Christ, regardless of how good you are, your sins will not be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Therefore, the sin of covetousness cannot cause you to perish because Christ has borne your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But a covetous heart can prevent you from believing in Christ and being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Such a heart will make you perish.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I have nothing else to say except to beseech you to ask yourself this question: Are you a covetous person?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Have you not believed in Christ because of covetousness?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If this is true, please investigate this matter: is money or eternal life better?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Unless you are a fool, you will never choose wealth and go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>A covetous man will go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Please be careful!</S>
