<h2 class="head1">HOW TO DISTRIBUTE TRACTS</h2><p>After realizing the importance of tract distribution, we have to consider the methods of passing out tracts.</p><h2 class="head2">Ordinary Ways</h2><p>The most common way to pass out tracts is by ordinary day-to-day sowing. In passing out tracts this way, we have to note the following points. First, the tracts must be powerful before God. They must have words that clinch. Tracts that are effective in saving souls should be used again and again. Tracts that are ineffective should be discarded. Tracts that are effective should be reprinted again and again. In passing out tracts on the streets, we should not break local laws. Second, we should pray for God's blessing before setting out so that every tract will carry saving grace with it. Third, when we pass out tracts, we have to pay attention to our attire and expressions. Our dress has to be proper; it must match our status. We should neither be too modern nor too modest; our clothes must be proper. Moreover, we have to be very polite. If we are reaching middle-class people, we should dress like a middle-class person. Fourth, in passing out tracts, we should be sincere and sober in our attitude. Do not be flippant or light. Do not act like the street hawkers, and do not behave rashly. In giving out a tract, hold it out with your left hand, bow or nod at others, and then present it to them. If they accept it, give them another acknowledging bow or nod.</p><p>If a person refuses a tract, we should not become angry. If he throws it away, we can pick it up again. If he turns around and reviles us, we should not argue with him. We can do the following: 1) let him go; 2) send him away politely; 3) try to convince him with a few words; or 4) pick up the tract again and pray for the tract.</p><p>If possible, the church should pray often for the work of tract distribution. We should pray that the Lord would give us more fruit. In order to get more fruit, we have to persevere in prayer. We have to pray 1) that God would bless those who receive the tracts; 2) that God would not allow the tracts to be destroyed; 3) that God would allow the tracts to be passed along; 4) that God would save everyone whose hand has touched the tract; and 5) that God would extend the days of the tracts.</p><h2 class="head2">Special Ways</h2><p>The second way to pass out tracts is more special. The ordinary way is non-systematic; this distribution is done anywhere and everywhere. Special distribution is distribution according to a plan. We can group our people by teams and distribute tracts door to door along each street. In order to carry out this way of distribution, we must first divide ourselves into teams. We can put two brothers in a team or two sisters in a team. We can assign a street or highway to them. After the team assignment, we can tell them to give one tract to each household. Next we pray for the tracts. We should seek for an opening word with which to speak to others. We should also seek to know how long we should wait before visiting the same neighborhood again. Tract distributors should commit themselves to go out once every other day or once every three days or four days. At least they should go out once a week. At the assigned time, they should divide up the tracts according to the questions the tracts address and distribute them to each person according to need. Finally, they have to pray for blessing.</p><p>In passing out tracts, there are a few things to remember. First, we should find the name of each household from the telephone book. We should write the name of each household on an envelope and send out the tracts in the envelope. Second, we should deliver tracts to some people in person. Third, in mailing tracts, we should write the names and addresses legibly and drop the mail in the mailbox. In passing out tracts, others may ask what we are doing. We can tell them that we are delivering the glorious gospel of the Son of God to them. Some methods have been used in other parts of the world with great success. Many times entire households have been saved. Fourth, we can take a street or a district as a unit and ask some brothers and sisters to be responsible for distribution along that street or in that district. This is also a very good way.</p><h2 class="head2">Personal Distribution</h2><p>Another way of distribution is the personal way. The personal way targets our relatives and friends. Sometimes it is hard to preach the gospel to our relatives and friends. But it is easier to give them a tract. We have to be careful in choosing the tracts we give. We must consider the condition of every case. We can show some people how sin has damaged them. We can show others how money and vainglory cannot satisfy. We have to pray for them and bless them. In presenting tracts to them, we have to be serious and polite. We have to say, "There are many things which I cannot say, and there are many things which I myself do not know. But I would like to give this tract to you. Please read it." After returning home, we should pray for them and ask God to bless them and to make the tract fruitful. In this way, it will be easy for us to spread the gospel to our friends and relatives.</p><h2 class="head1">OTHER MATTERS</h2><p>If we are faithful in carrying out this burden, we will soon find that our tracts are very inadequate. Although some tracts are small, they are very effective in saving people. These tracts should be reprinted again and again. Our tracts should not be for looks only. They have to have words that catch men. These are the useful words. The language and content of the tract have to be clear and direct; there must not be any misspelled words. If there is a misspelled word in a tract, it may lose its effectiveness. In writing tracts, we have to be very careful. No one can be careless in the work of God.</p><p>In preaching the gospel, we have to learn to speak the right words to the right people. In distributing tracts, we have to do the same, giving the right people the right kind of tracts. For example, if you give a worldly person a tract about the vanity of the world, his chance of getting saved will be great. Some people have had contact with the church already; a tract explaining the depth of the Lord's grace may be very effective in bringing about their salvation. (One becomes conscious of sin only after he has believed. If we talk to an uninterested person about sin, we may offend him.) The most direct approach to ordinary worldly people is to speak to them about the vanity of the world. This will easily bring them to salvation.</p><p>We must carry tracts in our pocket all the time, like carrying our business cards. As soon as we meet a person, we should give him a tract. Sometimes it is hard to open our mouth. A tract can take the place of our speaking, and others will not feel too much imposition. Some people like to ramble about scurrilous things as soon as they sit down. A tract will shut their mouths and even give us a chance to open our mouth. When we present a tract to them, we can say a few words or we can say nothing at all. If we practice this faithfully, the Lord will save many people.</p><p>Finally, we have to remember that while we are the ones who are passing out the tracts, we cannot depend on ourselves. We should not think that we can save anyone. We have to trust in the Spirit of God. Whenever we pass out a tract, we have to pray that the Lord will bless the receiver of the tract. We have to ask God's Spirit to save men through these tracts.</p>
