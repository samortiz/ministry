   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN DEALING WITH THE CONSCIENCE 1 Scripture Reading: Acts 24:16; 1 Tim 1:5, 19; 3:9; 4:2; 2 Tim 1:3; Rom 9:1; 2 Cor 1:12; Heb 13:18; Eph 4:19</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous chapter we saw a full sketch concerning the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The heart is a composition of four things: the mind, the emotion, the will, and the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order for the heart to be proper, the mind must be clear, enlightened, and transformed; it must be as crystal, transparent and not opaque.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then the emotion must be loving and caring toward the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In addition, the will must not be weak but strong, yet not stubborn but soft and pliable.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then the conscience must be right; it must be a good and pure conscience, a conscience without any offense.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>With these four together we have a proper heart.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the mind is transparent, the emotion loving toward the Lord, the will pliable, and the conscience good, pure, and without offense, then the heart is proper.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now we must see something more concerning the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There are many things spoken in the Scriptures concerning the conscience, which is very important, not only to the heart but also to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE SOURCE OF THE CONSCIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is hard to find a verse that tells us what the source of the conscience is, where it came from, and how it came into function.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Before the fall of Adam, man was innocent.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To be innocent means that there was no need for the function of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If there were the function of the conscience, it would mean that man was not innocent.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, we do not dare say that there was no conscience, because the conscience is a part of the created human being.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In God's creation the conscience was there already, but its function was not there; before the fall of man its function was not yet developed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We may compare this to certain functions of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The medical doctors can tell us that when we were born of our parents, we had everything in our body, but certain functions still needed to be developed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Bible students agree that the first of the so-called seven dispensations was the dispensation of innocence, the dispensation without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The second dispensation was the dispensation of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is because before the fall man had no sin, so there was no need for the function of the conscience, but after the fall man was in sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From that time, therefore, man began to need his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This dispensation was the period of man living under the government of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The conscience was created by God, but the function of the conscience was developed after the fall of man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE POSITION OF THE CONSCIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In order to know the position of the conscience, we need to know the whole human being.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A person is of three parts spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The three parts of the soul are the mind, the emotion, and the will, and the spirit has the three functions of the conscience, the fellowship, and the intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then as we have seen, the heart comprises all three parts of the soul and one function of the spirit, the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By this we can see the position of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The conscience is the very means to control the spirit and the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is the most important part of the spirit as well as of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When our conscience is wrong, our heart is wrong, and our spirit is also wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Both our heart and our spirit depend on the conscience.</S>
