   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>How we wish that we did not have to speak what we are speaking here!</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How we wish that the scattered children of God could walk according to His word and could move solely by God's instruction without any tradition or self-will.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If this were the case, we would not have need to say all the things that we have said!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But since we are at a time of apostasy and tradition, we, the servants of God, dare not be silent, and we dare not keep back our testimony against sin, whether it be sin in the world or sin in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord Jesus said in Revelation 2:6, "But this you have, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the original language, the last clause can be translated as "which things I also hate."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Brothers, please be assured that what we are speaking here is not aimed at certain persons.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are not speaking about a specific person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If this is the case, may God save us from the sin of criticizing His children!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are like the Lord, addressing only the things themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He said, "Which things I also hate."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He did not say, "These persons I also hate."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We dare not speak, act, or have any motive beyond what the Bible has recorded.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What we do not want and what saddens our hearts the most is to often find at the end of this age of apostasy that we are living in an environment where man teaches as teachings the commandments of men Matt 15:9 and accepts the "tradition of the elders" v. 2 without searching into them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These traditions, moreover, are related to the former spiritual giants whom we love and honor.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We admit that in many denominations there are many true servants of God; their names always invoke our respect.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>May God be gracious to us if we have the intention to speak concerning them!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, here lies our very danger.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those whom we respect, whether past or present, are in the denominations and have received the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We think that the things that have been passed on through their hands to us, being the "tradition of the elders," should not be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As a result, we do not compare them with the word of God in His light and do not differentiate and examine carefully to see if what we have received and what is declared are contrary to the teaching of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although we respect many servants of God in the denominations, we must be careful!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should not neglect the authority of the Bible through our respect for them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We respect Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We respect John Wesley, Calvin, and thousands of other servants of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Yet we must know that the standard of our faith and walk is "thus saith Jehovah" rather than "thus saith Luther, Wesley, or Calvin" or many other names less prominent than these.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is right to respect and honor them, but we must not become extreme in doing this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Otherwise, we will fall into danger.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some may think that the question of the church is not important and that there is no great difference between one system and another, that all are right.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have nothing to say concerning this remark.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, there is one thing that we have to know, that is, our Lord can never be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His attitude toward everything should be the attitude of every Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He said, "Which things I also hate."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He has a reason for this, and He cannot be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All those who fellowship with the Lord, who know the Lord's heart, and who are willing to be obedient to Him should sympathize with Him and should hate what He hates.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No matter what others may say, and no matter how spiritual and good they are, if we stand on the Lord's ground, we are safe.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not be afraid of trouble, nor should we be shy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should rather take the same attitude that the Lord has.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we do not sympathize with the Lord, we cannot have the same kind of declaration as the Lord has.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He said that He hates the works of the Nicolaitans.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How many are there who hate together with Him?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Let us come back to our subject.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord said, "In the same way you also have some who hold in like manner the teaching of the Nicolaitans."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should pay particular attention to the words "in like manner."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The last verse mentions "the teaching of Balaam."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This verse mentions "the teaching of the Nicolaitans."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What the Lord means here is that in the church in Pergamos, as there were those who held the teaching of Balaam, in the same way there were those who held the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans are twin sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When one comes, the other is also there.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The essence of the teaching of Balaam is to work for money and to seduce the people of God to join the world, to worship idols, and to commit fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The essence of the teaching of the Nicolaitans is to monopolize all spiritual matters and to create hierarchies in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have seen how the present churches have been fully fermented by these two teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the church there are hierarchies, and all the spiritual things and things related to worship are monopolized by the clergymen.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the other hand, hired workers fill the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Under the direction of their work, they attempt to break down all barriers between the church and the world and to join the two together, having the same appearance in the world and taking the same stand in things regarding the world.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They adopt the worldly festivals and other ceremonies and ordinances and commit the sin of idolatry before God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Furthermore, they join themselves to the worldly philosophies, schools, and doctrines, giving them a biblical name, while propagating worldly wisdom and committing fornication before God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As a result, the Lord has the following words of warning:</S>
