   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Husbands Loving Their Wives</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>as Christ Loved the Church</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Both Ephesians 5:25 and Colossians 3:19 say that husbands should love their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The opposite of subjection is ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, Paul does not exhort husbands to rule over their wives but to love them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In married life, the wife s obligation is to be subject and the husband s obligation is to love.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A wife s subjection plus a husband s love constitutes a proper married life and typifies the normal church life in which the church is subject to Christ and Christ loves the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By being filled in spirit and saturated by the word of Christ, husbands will love their wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her Eph 5:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A husband s love for his wife must be like Christ s love for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that a husband should give himself up for his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To give oneself up is to sacrifice one s life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Husbands should love their wives at such a cost to themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They must be willing to pay a great price, even to die for their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Ephesians 5:28 says, In the same way the husbands also ought to love their own wives as their own bodies; he who loves his own wife loves himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this verse Paul twice speaks of husbands loving their own wives.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This indicates that a husband is to love his wife without comparing her to others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Not only so, husbands should love their own wives as their own bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A husband should regard his wife as part of his body and care for her as his own body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 29 says, No one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We show love for our body by nourishing and cherishing it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To nourish is to feed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Spiritually speaking, husbands should nourish their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Just as we eat for the sake of our body, a husband needs to nourish his wife, to take care of her need, just as he takes care of the need of his own body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the meaning of nourishes in verse 29.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Husbands should also love their wives as their own bodies by cherishing their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To cherish is to nurture with tender love and foster with tender care.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To cherish something is to care for it deeply and tenderly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is to soften it through tender warmth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the way Christ cares for the church, His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This should also be the way for husbands to love their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here we see the depth of love that a husband must have for his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Children Obeying Their Parents in the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>and Honoring Them</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Ephesians 6:1 says, Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Colossians 3:20 says, Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well pleasing in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The children of the believers are not common.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They are different from the children of people in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, the children in the families of believers are exhorted to obey their parents in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The phrase in the Lord indicates obedience to the parents by being one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It also indicates that this should be done not by self-effort but by the Lord, and not according to the natural concept but according to the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The children of believers should realize that they are to obey their parents by being one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Moreover, they obey their parents not by their own strength but by the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Their obedience is according to the Lord s word, according to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Ephesians 6:2-3 says, Honor your father and mother, which is the first commandment with a promise, that it may be well with you and that you may live long on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is not only the first commandment with a promise but also the first commandment concerning man s relationship with man Exo 20:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The promise in verse 3 is that it may be well with the children and that they may live long on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The first part of the promise is related to prosperity in material blessing; it also refers to living in a peaceful situation.</S>

   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>According to this commandment, prosperity and longevity are God s blessings in this life to those who honor their parents.</S>
