the Second Time with His Overcomers</h2>
<p>&ldquo;There cause Your mighty ones to descend, / O Jehovah!&rdquo; (Joel 3:11b). This reveals that Christ will be sent by God the second time with His overcomers. Today Christ is making overcomers, those who will be with Him in His coming back. When Christ comes back, He will come with His overcomers to fight against Antichrist.</p>
<p>In the universe there are two sources: God and Satan. God is embodied in Christ, and Satan will eventually be embodied in Antichrist. Both Christ and Antichrist will have an army. In His coming back Christ will descend with His army, composed of the mighty ones, the overcomers. This indicates that at the time of His coming back, Christ and His army will defeat Antichrist and his army.</p>
<h2 class="head3">9. In His Arising as the Sun of Righteousness<br />
with Healing in His Wings</h2>
<p>As we have seen, according to Malachi 4:2 Christ will arise as the Sun of righteousness with healing in His wings.</p>
<h2 class="head3">10. In His Going Forth as the Dawn<br />
and Coming as the Rain,<br />
as the Latter Rain Which Waters the Earth</h2>
<p>Hosea 6:3b says, &ldquo;His going forth is as sure as the dawn, / And He will come to us as the rain, / As the latter rain which waters the earth.&rdquo; In 10:12 we are told that Christ will come and rain righteousness upon us. Christ&rsquo;s going forth has not stopped. He is still going forth as the dawn. Also He will come as the rain, even as the latter rain. How much Christ is to us! He is the dawn, the rain, and the latter rain.</p>
<h2 class="head3">11. In His Second Coming as the Angel<br />
of the Covenant, Whom Israel Desires</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The Angel of the covenant, whom you desire, behold, He will come, says Jehovah of hosts&rdquo; (Mal. 3:1b). This speaks of Christ in His second coming as the Angel of the covenant, whom Israel desires. The covenant of which He is the Angel is the new covenant.</p>
<h2 class="head3">12. In His Coming as the Mighty One<br />
with His Overcomers<br />
to Defeat Antichrist and His Army</h2>
<p>In Joel 3:11 Christ is unveiled in His coming as the mighty One with His overcomers to defeat Antichrist and his army.</p>
<h2 class="head3">13. In His Judgment of the Nations</h2>
<p>Christ is also unveiled in His judgment of the nations&mdash;the judgment of the living (Joel 3:2a, 12, 14; Matt. 25:31-46; Acts 10:42; 17:31).</p>
<h2 class="head3">14. In His Dwelling in the Holy Mountain of Zion<br />
within Jerusalem to Reign among Israel</h2>
<p>Joel 3 unveils Christ in His dwelling in the holy mountain of Zion within Jerusalem to reign among Israel to be their God, their shelter, and their stronghold (vv. 16-17, 21b).</p>
<h2 class="head3">15. In His Reigning in Zion as David Their King,<br />
as Ruler in Israel, in the Millennium</h2>
<p>David was a type of Christ as the King. In the Minor Prophets Christ is unveiled in His reigning in Zion as Israel&rsquo;s King, the Ruler in Israel, in the millennium (Micah 4:7b; 5:2b; Hosea 3:5a; Zeph. 3:15b; Rev. 20:4, 6).</p>
<h2 class="head3">16. In His Shepherding of Israel,<br />
Becoming Great and Being Their Peace</h2>
<p>Finally, Christ is unveiled in His shepherding of Israel, becoming great and being their peace (Micah 5:4-5). In the millennium Christ will be not only the King and the Ruler but also the Shepherd.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of the Minor Prophets &nbsp; pg 4</div><br></body></html>
