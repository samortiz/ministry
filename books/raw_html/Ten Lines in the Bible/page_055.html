 <h2 class="head2">H. Satan&rsquo;s Poisoning of the World</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Deceiving the Whole Inhabited Earth</h2>
<p>See Revelation 12:9 and 20:3.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Doing as He Pleases with the Whole World</h2>
<p>The whole world lies in the evil one, being manipulated and abused by him; this is like a surgical patient on the operation table, lying in the hands of the surgeon, being operated on by him as he wishes. See 1 John 5:19.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Being the God of the World<br />
and Blinding the Thoughts of the Unbelievers</h2>
<p>See 2 Corinthians 4:4.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Causing People to Worship Him through Idols</h2>
<p>Satan is behind all the idols. All idol-worship is the worship of Satan. See Revelation 9:20 and 1 Corinthians 10:20 and compare with Matthew 4:9.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Causing People to Become His Children<br />
with His Sinful Life and Evil Nature</h2>
<p>The Bible clearly says that those who practice sin are the children of the devil. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;You are of your father the devil&rdquo; (John 8:44). The devil&rsquo;s sinful life and evil nature are in his children. This is clearly spoken of in 1 John 3:8, John 8:44, and Matthew 23:33.</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. Causing People to Practice Sin</h2>
<p>Satan&rsquo;s most prevailing strategy against man is to cause him to practice sin. In today&rsquo;s dazzling world of sensual pleasures, everything that man does is sin. This is Satan&rsquo;s work. See 1 John 3:8.</p>
<h2 class="head3">7. Snatching the Word Away<br />
from the Heart of Men</h2>
<p>See Matthew 13:19.</p>
<h2 class="head3">8. Causing People to Pervert<br />
the Ways of the Lord</h2>
<p>See Acts 13:10.</p>
<h2 class="head3">9. Snaring and Catching People Alive</h2>
<p>See 2 Timothy 2:26.</p>
<h2 class="head3">10. Binding People</h2>
<p>Satan binds people with illnesses, demons, the environment, riches, position, fame, and knowledge. See Luke 13:16.</p>
<h2 class="head3">11. Possessing People</h2>
<p>See Mark 5:2.</p>
<h2 class="head3">12. Bringing Afflictions to the World</h2>
<p>The afflictions that are brought to the whole world include wars, natural disasters, man-made calamities, and all kinds of diseases. Revelation 12:12 says, &ldquo;Woe to the earth and the sea because the devil has come down to you and has great rage, knowing that he has only a short time.&rdquo; When Satan is cast down, great tribulation will begin on the earth; Satan will do all that he can to bring afflictions to the world. His heart delights in the hardships and the sufferings of man. Whereas God loves man, Satan does evil toward man.</p>
<h2 class="head3">13. Deceiving the Nations to War against God</h2>
<p>Revelation 20:3 says that when the thousand years are completed, Satan will be loosed for a little time. His final work will be to deceive the nations of that age to war against God.</p>
