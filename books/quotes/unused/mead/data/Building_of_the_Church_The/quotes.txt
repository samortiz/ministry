[1]  IN HIS CHOSEN PLACE OF ONENESS Scripture Reading: Eph 5:32; Matt 16:18; Eph 2:22; 4:3-6; Deut 12:11-14, 17-18; John 4:24 CREATION, REDEMPTION, AND BUILDING
[2]  He is the great God with a great purpose.
[3]  In the sixty-six books of the Bible we can find only one unique purpose of God.
[4]  God has gone on from His creation to His redemption, but neither creation nor redemption is God s purpose.
[5]  The disciples told Him, Some, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets v. 14 . Then the Lord Jesus asked the disciples, Who do you say that I am? v. 15 . Peter had the boldness to answer, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God v. 16 . Jesus said, Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens.
[6]  SATAN S STRATEGY TO FRUSTRATE GOD S BUILDING Veiling God s People to Prevent Them
[7]  We all need to see these three great matters creation, redemption, and building.
[8]  The situation in Christianity today is that all the believers have been divided by all kinds of concepts, all kinds of understandings of the same Bible.
[9]  The Bible is one book, but there are thousands of differences in the interpretation of this one book.
[10]  However, the Bible consummates not in any believer s concept or interpretation but in God s building.
[11]  The unique ground chosen by God in the Old Testament for His people to gather to worship Him is a physical type.
[12]  For years it was difficult for us to see this, but by the Lord s mercy and through much experience, we have seen what today s Jerusalem is.
[13]  REVEALED IN GENESIS Scripture Reading: Col 1:27; 2:9; 3:4; Eph 3:8-11; 2 Tim 4:22; Gal 2:20; 1 Cor 1:30; 15:45b
[14]  Rather, the Bible is a book of revelation, revealing to us that the God of purpose is living, moving, and working.
[15]  Regardless of how subtle Satan is or how much he does to try to frustrate God s purpose, God simply laughs at him, saying, Little Satan, whatever you have done and whatever you are going to do will only turn out to help Me to fulfill My purpose.
[16]  Then God came into the garden and asked Adam if he had eaten of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil v. 11 . Adam answered by blaming God for making Eve, saying, The woman whom You gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate v. 12 . God did not rebuke Adam or condemn him.
[17]  Genesis 4 presents Abel, who brought to God an offering that was pleasing to Him v. 4 . This offering was probably instituted by God when He killed the animals to make coats of skin to clothe Adam and Eve after the fall 3:21 . Thus, if it were not for the fall, man could not have experienced God s pleasure as deeply.
[18]  It may seem inappropriate for us to appreciate the fall, but we must admit that it is truly wonderful that although man is fallen and has a sinful nature, he can please God.
[19]  In the end of Genesis 4, at the time of Enosh, men began to call on the name of the Lord v. 26 . Thus, Genesis 4 reveals not only that we can please God but also that we can call on His name.
[20]  It is by calling on the name of the Lord that we can participate in all His riches Rom 10:12 .
[21]  In Genesis 3 and 4 God was moving and working, revealing the way for man to be living 3:15, 20 , the way for man to please God 4:4 , and the way of calling on the name of the Lord v. 26 . Then in chapter 5 God went on to reveal that man can walk with God vv.
[22]  We may think that it is good enough to have the way to be living, the way to please God, the way of calling on the name of the Lord, and the way of walking with God.
[23]  On one hand, the revelation of the proper church life in the Lord s recovery is new; on the other hand, it is old, for the apostle Paul saw this revelation.
[24]  A number of people today accuse me of teaching heresy because I say that Christ is the Spirit.
[25]  However, the more they try to oppose this truth, the more they expose their own folly.
[26]  I cannot find a verse in the New Testament that says that Christ is in us through the Holy Spirit, but I can immediately think of at least five verses that tell us that Christ Himself is in us John 14:20; Rom 8:10; 2 Cor 13:5; Gal 2:20; Col 1:27 .
[27]  Christ has become the life-giving Spirit, and now He is with our spirit to be our righteousness, our sanctification, our redemption, our life, our patience, our humility, our boldness, and everything to us for the fulfillment of God s purpose.
[28]  In the Lord s recovery today we are churching, we are practicing the proper church life, in order to build today s ark.
[29]  To many in degraded Christianity, their Christ is like a canoe, a single piece of carved wood.
[30]  Today we are churching in order to build the ark, in which we are saved not only from eternal perdition but also from this crooked and perverted generation.
[31]  The ark saved Noah and his family not only from perdition under God s judgment but also from the evil generation of his day.
[32]  God s present revelation is for us to build up the church as the ark, not to be saved from eternal perdition but to be saved from the present evil age and into the coming kingdom age to fulfill God s eternal purpose.
[33]  REVEALED IN THE EXPERIENCE AND WRITINGS OF PETER Scripture Reading: John 1:42; Matt 16:18; 1 Pet 1:3, 23; 2:2, 5; 3:4, 21; 5:2-4, 5b, 10 THE THREE GREAT APOSTLES
[34]  In this chapter we will consider the building of the church revealed in the experience and writings of Peter.
[35]  Although we may already know Peter quite well, I have a burden to help us to know him more, to know him in a deeper way.
[36]  He was not the first who was brought to the Lord, but he surely was the first who was commissioned to establish the churches Matt 16:19 .
[37]  Although I came from a heathen land, China, I was born and raised in Christianity.
[38]  From my youth I heard preachers, pastors, and ministers speaking concerning Peter, preaching that the Lord called Peter to be a fisher of men Matt 4:19 .
[39]  This is certainly true, but I never heard one preacher say that the Lord made Peter a stone.
[40]  Peter took the lead to answer, saying, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God v. 16 . The Lord replied to him, I also say to you that you are Peter v. 18 . It seems that the Lord was saying, Do not forget the new name that I gave you; you are a stone.
[41]  Peter saw this vision, for in his preaching on the day of Pentecost, he indicated that Jesus Christ is not only the Savior for the salvation of God s chosen ones but also the stone for God s eternal building.
[42]  INTO PRECIOUS STONES FOR GOD S BUILDING By Regeneration
[43]  Now we need to see how we fallen, sinful, polluted, and contaminated human beings can become precious stones for God s building.
[44]  First Peter 1:3 says that we have been regenerated through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[45]  For us to be regenerated through the resurrection of Christ means that we are identified with Christ we were put into Christ and are one with Christ.
[46]  First Peter 3:4 mentions the hidden man of the heart.
[47]  Perhaps we have never realized that in our heart there is a hidden man.
[48]  Some may think that this hidden man is Jesus, but according to this verse it is a meek and quiet spirit.
[49]  IN JOHN S MENDING MINISTRY OF LIFE Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 3:6, 9-12a; 14:5, 12; Eph 2:20-22; 4:12-16
[50]  The matter of the building of the church was revealed by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 16 after Peter recognized that the Lord Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the living God v. 16 . The Lord said to him, I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it v. 18 . After the matter of building was first revealed by the Lord Jesus, it was mentioned again by Peter in his preaching to the leaders of the Jews.
[51]  He stood before them and told them that Jesus Christ was not only the Savior but also the stone for God s building Acts 4:11-12 .
[52]  If we call on the Lord one evening, the next morning something within us will begin rebuking, bothering, directing, and checking us, all the time saying no. We may be thinking of going to the theater, but something within will say no. If we are planning to play basketball, something within may say no. Perhaps when we are planning to buy a particular pair of shoes, something within will say no. Surely, we have all had this kind of troubling.
[53]  In Matthew 16:18 the Lord said, I will build My church.
[54]  Then Paul came in to tell us something further that we are not only being built but are also building.
[55]  We may think that Christ was the Builder, that the apostle Paul was a builder, and that today the leading brothers are builders, but that we ourselves are not builders.
[56]  We have seen the building of the church revealed to Peter and to Paul.
[57]  The Lord began to show us that God s being three persons is only one aspect of God; the other aspect is that God is one Isa 45:5; 1 Tim 2:5 .
[58]  In the Lord s recovery today we are not for doctrinal disputation but for the pure revelation of the Word of God, which brings us back to life for the building of the church to fulfill God s purpose.
