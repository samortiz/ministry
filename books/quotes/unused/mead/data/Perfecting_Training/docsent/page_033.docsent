   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTEEN PRACTICING TO LIVE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we need a little turn in the Perfecting Training.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I would like to ask two brothers to tell us their conclusion of the past messages concerning this ugly matter of peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After listening to so many messages, what is peculiarity according to your understanding?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I am concerned that perhaps some may not have understood this matter of peculiarity in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Please tell us what is meant by peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First brother: Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Maybe, brothers and sisters, my understanding is still quite doctrinal concerning this matter, but I think that one thing we ve all seen through these Perfecting Meetings is that we are peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may not have a very specific definition of what our peculiarity is, but we do have the realization that all of us are peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It seems to me, Brother Lee, that you ve been sharing very much on peculiarity, and at the same time you ve been sharing very much with us concerning living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It seems that we have peculiarity on the one hand and on the other we have the lack of living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although my understanding may be quite doctrinal, it seems that peculiarity in our being is just that element that frustrates us from living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is a kind of blockade or a kind of frustration in our being that just keeps the Lord as our person from living out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I guess peculiarity is just what I am without Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Second brother: I wasn t here last week, but according to the fellowship in the other meetings, I would say simply that peculiarity is what we are apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>PECULIARITY TO LIVE YOURSELF</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is quite close, but still I don t think you have hit home with the answers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After many messages which may have puzzled you, I would like to tell you now that peculiarity is just to live yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Peculiarity is to live one s self.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>GOD S INTENTION</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God s intention in having man is for man to express Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Man was made in the image of God and after His likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is clear that God s intention is to have man to express Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is easy for any vessel without life to contain something and to express the content.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The vessel has no life and no personality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>So whatever you want to put into a vessel without life and personality causes no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But man as God s vessel is a living person with personality.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God created us this way with a mind, a will, and an emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>So it s not simple for man to contain God and to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE RESULT OF THE FALL OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What is the fall of man?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The fall of man is just to bring man away from God and to make man a biased character.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As a result of the fall man became biased.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Man became not so cooperative with God s intention.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, man s eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge made him independent.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All the mothers know that in the children there is the independent fallen nature.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You don t need to teach your children to say no. From a very early age they say no. No represents the independent nature of fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every fallen man is independent.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As an independent person no one would live the life of another.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Everyone likes to live herself or himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In marriage life this is the biggest problem.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Regardless of how much a husband and wife love each other, each still likes to live himself or herself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to God s ordination the two should be one.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One is the head, and the other is in subjection to the head, so the two become one.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Yet in nearly every marriage, the two still remain two.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because we are fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We don t like to live the life of another; we just like to live ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Regardless of how much you love your wife, you still like to live yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>And regardless of how much your wife is submissive and how much she loves you, if you touch her living of herself she will react.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>So the wisest policy of the husband is just to honor his wife s living of herself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you honor that point, she will be happy all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you let her live herself, she will be happy.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Don t touch that part.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When you touch that part, she will rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is the same with little children.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If the parents let the little children live themselves, they re happy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Why are many American children eagerly expecting to reach eighteen years of age?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is because when they reach eighteen, they are like birds out of a cage; they have the freedom to live themselves.</S>
