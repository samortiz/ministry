<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>Beginning with this lesson we enter into another section of the <em>Truth Lessons.</em> We will use twenty-four lessons to focus on the initial stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, the stage of regeneration. In this first lesson we will see the condition of man after Adam&rsquo;s fall and before man receives God&rsquo;s salvation. Man&rsquo;s condition reveals his need for salvation.</p>
<p>After the fall and before receiving salvation, man&rsquo;s condition before God, in himself, and under Satan&rsquo;s hand is exceedingly pitiful and tragic.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE CONDITION BEFORE GOD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Having Sinned</h2>
<p>The first condition of man before God is that man has sinned and is sinful (Rom. 3:23, 10-12; 5:12). The sinfulness of man before God is in two aspects: positional and experiential. Positionally speaking, because men are descendants of Adam, who was the head of the human race and who represented all mankind, when Adam sinned, men were brought into a sinful position before God. Furthermore, because Adam was the forefather of mankind, out of whom came the whole human race (Acts 17:26a), he not only represented but also included the whole human race when he sinned. Therefore, when he sinned, all the descendants who would be born of him sinned together with him and in him. Through one person&rsquo;s sinning, all the descendants of this one committed sin in him (cf. Heb. 7:9-10).</p>
<p>Men are sinful before God also from the standpoint of experience. Who has never sinned? Who has clean hands and a pure heart and has no experience of sin? No one can avoid lying, stealing, coveting, and filthy thinking. Because men are in a sinful position, they fall into sinful experiences; these sinful experiences of men prove that men are in a sinful position. Hence, whether in position or in experience, man is sinful.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Being under God&rsquo;s Judgment<br />
and Condemnation</h2>
<p>Because men have sinned, they are under the judgment of God (Rom. 3:19). God is righteous, and He is the One who established the law; but men are sinful and commit sins. Therefore, according to God&rsquo;s righteousness and God&rsquo;s law, God must judge sinners. Hence, God&rsquo;s righteousness and God&rsquo;s law have subjected all the world to the judgment of God.</p>
<p>Today men are not only under God&rsquo;s judgment, but they have been condemned already before God (John 3:18). Whether they know it or not, whether they sense it or not, men have been condemned already before God. People do not need to wait to be judged and then condemned by God. They were condemned before God long ago. When Adam sinned and was condemned by God, all men were condemned in him through his one offense (Rom. 5:18a). Today all men are already condemned sinners at the very moment of their birth.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Being under God&rsquo;s Wrath</h2>
<p>Because men have sinned and violated God&rsquo;s righteousness, they are not only condemned under God&rsquo;s judgment, but they are also children of wrath (Eph. 2:3) under God&rsquo;s wrath (John 3:36). People live in the lusts of their flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts; thus, they contradict God&rsquo;s righteousness and daily incite God&rsquo;s wrath. Today God&rsquo;s wrath is waiting to explode on men like thunder ready to roar. God is waiting in order to give people the opportunity to repent and be saved. Unless men repent, eventually God&rsquo;s wrath will burst forth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. To Suffer Death and Judgment</h2>
<p>The fruit of sin is death (James 1:15; Rom. 6:23a). Because men have sinned, according to the law of God&rsquo;s righteousness, it is reserved for men to die once (Heb. 9:27a). That which is placed before the impenitent sinners today is simply death. If people are not willing to repent, they have no alternative but to wait for death under the wrath of God. When death comes upon men, that is the bursting forth of God&rsquo;s wrath on them.</p>
<p>According to what God has reserved for men, all must die once and after that face judgment (Heb. 9:27). Although men have been condemned already under God&rsquo;s judgment, they still must suffer judgment again after death. This judgment is to carry out God&rsquo;s condemnation. God already has condemned men according to His righteousness; yet because of His love, He has not carried out His condemnation. God desires men to repent, and He also gives them the opportunity and is waiting for them to repent. If people would not repent, eventually they will enter into death and suffer God&rsquo;s final judgment, which will be the judgment before the great white throne (Rev. 20:11-13).</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. To Perish in the Lake of Fire</h2>
<p>After suffering God&rsquo;s final judgment, men will suffer the penalty of eternal fire and perish in the lake of fire for eternity (John 3:16; Rev. 20:15; 21:8), where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched (Mark 9:48).</p>
<p>The foregoing points reveal the condition of man before God after Adam&rsquo;s fall.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE CONDITION IN HIMSELF</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being Brought Forth in Iniquity</h2>
<p>Through the fall of one man, Adam, the forefather of the human race, sin entered into the world (Rom. 5:12) and was passed on in man from generation to generation. Hence, men are brought forth in iniquity and are conceived in sin (Psa. 51:5). Because they are born sinners and because their nature is corrupt, people do not need to learn how to sin; rather, to sin is something inherent, something which grows out from within them. The seed of sin is in a person at his birth, and at a certain time it will grow out from within him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Being Constituted of Sin</h2>
<p>Men are not only brought forth in iniquity but also constituted of sin. Through Adam&rsquo;s disobedience the many were constituted sinners (Rom. 5:19). Sin became the constituent of man. Men were not created sinners, but constituted sinners. An element not created by God was injected into men and constituted them sinners. Sin is not just an outward deed, but even more an inward element in man&rsquo;s constitution.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Heart Being Deceitful above All Things</h2>
<p>Because man is brought forth in iniquity and is constituted of sin, the imagination of his heart is evil from his youth (Gen. 8:21). Furthermore, man&rsquo;s heart is deceitful above all things, desperately wicked, and incurable (Jer. 17:9), being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, malice, and full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, and malignity (Rom. 1:29-30). Hence, the heart is wicked to the core and hopeless. Moreover, this wickedness does not spread inward from the outside; it stems from within. People may look good on the outside, yet they are actually evil on the inside. When it becomes necessary, all the wicked things will be let out from within them (Mark 7:23).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Nothing Good Dwelling in the Flesh</h2>
<p>Man is brought forth in iniquity and is constituted of sin. Furthermore, his heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked. Hence, nothing good dwells in his flesh (Rom. 7:18). On the contrary, it is filled with wickedness, lusts, and evil impurities that came from Satan. In the Scriptures this flesh is called particularly the body of sin (Rom. 6:6) and the body of death (Rom. 7:24). It is altogether powerless in doing good, yet it is very active in committing sins. The works of the flesh, such as fornication, uncleanness, and sensuality, as listed in Galatians 5:19-21, clearly issue from within the flesh. Who can do the good that he wills? Is it not true that to will is present with man, but to do the good is not (Rom. 7:18b)? Because nothing good dwells in man&rsquo;s flesh, the good that man wills, he does not do; but the evil that he does not will, this he practices (Rom. 7:19).</p><h2 class="head2">E. Being an Enemy of God</h2>
<p>Since man&rsquo;s heart is deceitful above all things, desperately wicked, and filled with all kinds of unrighteousness and wickedness, it is naturally at enmity with God. Men are hostile toward God in their thoughts, desires, and decisions. Hence, they have become enemies of God (Col. 1:21) and sons of disobedience, walking according to the age of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, of the spirit who now is operating in them (Eph. 2:2). Furthermore, because men are enemies of God, naturally they are not subject to the law of God, nor are they acceptable to God (Rom. 8:7-8). Even if they desire to be, they cannot be because they are corrupt to the core and devoid of power.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Disapproving of Holding God<br />
in His Knowledge</h2>
<p>Although God&rsquo;s eternal power and characteristics are invisible, they are clearly seen, being apprehended by the things made, so that men are without excuse (Rom. 1:20). However, although people can know God, they test Him, try Him, refuse to know Him, disapprove of holding Him in their knowledge, and do not glorify Him as God nor thank Him, much less worship Him. Hence, they become vain in their reasonings, and their senseless heart is darkened. They even exchange God, changing the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of an image of corruptible man, birds, four-footed animals, and creeping things. They alter the truth of God into the lie, and worship and serve the creature rather than the Creator (Rom. 1:21, 23, 25, 28).</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. Being Lost and Having Gone Astray</h2>
<p>Since men disapprove of holding God in their knowledge, exchange God, and abandon God, they become lost (Luke 19:10), wandering outside, like sheep going astray (Isa. 53:6). Created by God for Himself, men came out of God and belonged to God, their Owner. But by sinning and deserting God, men have become lost and are without an owner. They are harassed and cast away, not knowing to whom they belong, and are as sheep not having a shepherd (Matt. 9:36).</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. Being Dead in Offenses and Sins</h2>
<p>Men are not only sinful and lost, but they are also dead in offenses and sins (Eph. 2:1, 5) and in the flesh (Col. 2:13a). This death, referring to the deadness of man&rsquo;s spirit, has invaded and permeated man&rsquo;s entire being, and it dwells in man with the law of death (Rom. 8:2b), the natural power that causes man to become weak, to wither up, and to age and die, thus bringing every part of man into decay and death. On the one hand, death disables man; on the other hand, it desensitizes man. Death causes man to become not only powerless in doing good and righteousness, but also insensitive to the shamefulness and hatefulness of sin. That is, it makes man helpless when doing good and numb when committing sins. Men are weak and impotent in doing good and righteousness. Furthermore, men can do many shameful things without feeling disgraceful, and they can do many hateful things without feeling sorrowful. Men behave like walking corpses when they sin and do evil.</p>
<h2 class="head2">I. Being a Slave of Sin</h2>
<p>Within man there is not only the law of death but also the law of sin (Rom. 8:2b), which is the inherent sinning power in him that causes him to sin spontaneously and makes him a slave of sin (John 8:34). Under the slavery and manipulation of sin, people do many things not of their own will. They desire to be free, yet they cannot be free; they struggle and endeavor, yet they cannot break away from the tyranny and slavery of sin. They do not like to commit sin or do evil, yet they cannot help it, and they desire to rid themselves of sin, yet they cannot do it.</p>
<p>Originally men belonged to God, but now they belong to sin; formerly they were under the ruling of God, but now they are under the ruling of sin. Sin has authority over people, making them its slaves and putting them under its tyranny. As a result, men commit sin and do the evil that they do not will (Rom. 7:14b-15). Hence, men are truly slaves of sin in the law of sin.</p>
<h2 class="head2">J. Having No Hope in the World<br />
and to Die Ultimately in Sins</h2>
<p>Men are brought forth in iniquity and are constituted of sin, their heart is deceitful above all things, and there is nothing good dwelling in their flesh. Furthermore, men are at enmity with God, have become sons of disobedience, and disapprove of holding God in their knowledge. Thus, they are lost, dead in offenses and sins, and have become slaves of sin. Hence, people live in the world today without hope (Eph. 2:12), without aim, without a destination, and not knowing the meaning of their life. Although they labor and toil all day long, covet blessing and pleasure, and seek vainglory, eventually everything is in vain and nothing is gained. It is like trying to catch a shadow and like chasing the wind. In the end men can only wait to die in sins (John 8:24), go to Hades in sorrow, and enter into eternal perdition. These are the different aspects of man&rsquo;s condition in himself.</p><h2 class="head1">III. THE CONDITION UNDER SATAN&rsquo;S HAND</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being a Child of the Devil</h2>
<p>Men are not only sinful and corrupt, but they are also out of the Devil (Satan) and belong to the Devil (1 John 3:8a). As descendants of fallen Adam, men are born children of the Devil, the evil one (John 8:44; 1 John 3:10), with a life that is mingled with the Devil&rsquo;s life and a nature that is mixed with Satan&rsquo;s nature. People lie, sin, walk in lusts, and murder. All these are manifestations of the Devil&rsquo;s life and nature, because the life and nature in men which cause them to lie, sin, walk in lusts, and murder are out of the Devil and belong to the Devil. Since men are related to the Devil in life and united with him in nature, they are therefore children of the Devil.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Obeying the Ruler of the Authority of the Air</h2>
<p>After the fall, men became children of the Devil and were subjected under his authority, obeying him as the ruler of the authority of the air (Eph. 2:2). Satan directs his angels to rule today in the air over the dark world (Eph. 6:12). Furthermore, he has become the evil spirit who operates in the hearts of men (Eph. 2:2). Thus, he brings people into obedience to him and makes them children of disobedience, opposers of God. All the things that men do to oppose God and all the evil things that men do are the result of Satan&rsquo;s operation in men&rsquo;s hearts. Hence, man not only has Satan&rsquo;s life and nature but also Satan himself as such an evil spirit operating within him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Mind Being Blinded<br />
by the God of This Age</h2>
<p>On the one hand, Satan operates in the hearts of men, causing them to do things to oppose God; on the other hand, he blinds their minds, making them unable to know God, unable to see the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ (2 Cor. 4:4). People think that they are wise, yet little do they know that their minds are manipulated and veiled by Satan. Although they understand philosophy and science, they neither comprehend the things of God nor know the salvation of Christ. They cannot tell from where they came and to where they are going. They neither recognize the way they are on nor know the meaning of human life. They walk and live like the blind, and they are altogether in darkness.</p>
<p>Satan is not only the one who controls the world (1 John 5:19b) and brings men into obedience to himself, but he is also the god of this age (2 Cor. 4:4) who commands people to worship him. He hides himself behind many persons, matters, and objects, especially idols, to be worshipped by men. Hence, people unconsciously worship Satan when they kneel before idols or when they worship or esteem any person, matter, or object; it is through these things that Satan veils their minds, making it impossible for them to know God. When their hearts adore such persons, matters, or objects, and their eyes esteem them, their minds are veiled and blinded by Satan.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Lying under the Hand of the Evil One</h2>
<p>Men are not only in obedience to Satan and veiled by Satan, but they also lie in the evil one, Satan (1 John 5:19b). After Satan has blinded the minds of men, he lords it over men, causing them to lie under his hand to be manipulated and slaughtered as he wishes. Even though people struggle to be set free, they cannot make it.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Being under Satan&rsquo;s Authority of Darkness</h2>
<p>Satan has his kingdom (Matt. 12:26) and his authority. His kingdom is his authority of darkness (Col. 1:13; Acts 26:18). Fallen men are subjects in his kingdom, ruled and controlled by him under his authority of darkness. They are in a realm where there is neither light nor righteousness, but rather one that is full of darkness and unrighteousness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. To Enter into the Eternal Fire<br />
Prepared for Satan</h2>
<p>The ultimate result of man&rsquo;s being under the hand of Satan is that he will enter with Satan into the eternal fire prepared for Satan (Matt. 25:41); that is, he will enter into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:15) to be tormented for eternity. Since men have joined Satan in sinning against God, they deserve to suffer the penalty of eternal fire with him. Because people have been following Satan to sin for their whole life, they should accompany Satan to suffer punishment for eternity. Since men are walking with Satan, they will arrive at the same destination with Satan. This is the final result and destiny of the fallen man.</p>
<p>As we have seen the tragic condition of man before God, in himself, and under Satan&rsquo;s hand, we must see and sense how much people need God&rsquo;s deliverance and salvation. Much more, we must be burdened to preach the gospel and save sinners that they may escape the destiny of perdition and may enter into God&rsquo;s full salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>After the fall of Adam and before receiving God&rsquo;s salvation, the condition of man before God, in himself, and under Satan&rsquo;s hand is pitiful and tragic. Before God men have sinned and are sinful both positionally and experientially; they have fallen under God&rsquo;s judgment and condemnation and have been condemned already; they are under the wrath of God and have become children of wrath; and according to God&rsquo;s ordination, unless they repent, they will enter into death, suffer God&rsquo;s final judgment, perish eternally in the lake of fire, and suffer the penalty of the eternal fire. In himself man is brought forth in iniquity, conceived in sin, born a sinner, corrupted in nature, and constituted of sin; his heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked, there is nothing good dwelling in his flesh, and he is an enemy of God as well as a son of disobedience; he disapproves of holding God in his knowledge and does not glorify Him nor thank Him, much less worship Him; he is lost and has gone astray, is dead in offenses and sins, and is a slave of sin, controlled and manipulated by sin; and having no hope in this world, he will die in sin, go to Hades in sorrow, and enter into eternal perdition. Under the hand of Satan men are born children of the evil one, the Devil, being subjected under his authority and obeying him as the ruler of the authority of the air. Furthermore, having been blinded by Satan in their minds, men cannot see the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ, and they lie under Satan&rsquo;s hand, under his authority of darkness, to be slaughtered as he pleases. Eventually men will enter into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil, which is the lake of fire, to suffer torment for eternity. This is the final result and destiny of the fallen mankind. All these conditions of man reveal his need for God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we shall see God&rsquo;s foreknowledge, selection, and predestination. Although man&rsquo;s fall was tragic, before the foundation of the world and in His sovereign ordination, God foreknew, chose, and predestinated a group of people to receive His salvation, that His purpose in man might be fulfilled. Although these three&mdash;God&rsquo;s foreknowledge, selection, and predestination&mdash;are different, they are related and are all wonderful acts of God toward the believers in eternity past and in His love. Therefore, the believers were destined to be blessed even in eternity past.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. GOD&rsquo;S FOREKNOWLEDGE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Basis of God&rsquo;s Selection</h2>
<p>Romans 8:29 indicates that the believers are those whom God foreknew. In eternity past, before the creation of the heavens and the earth and before the beginning of time, God foreknew us and predestinated us to be conformed to the image of His Son, that His Son should be the Firstborn among many brothers. This is God&rsquo;s ordination for all the believers.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s selection and predestination of the believers were based on His foreknowledge (1 Pet. 1:2). By exercising His divine foreknowledge, God chose us before the foundation of the world in eternity past.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. According to God&rsquo;s Good Pleasure</h2>
<p>God foreknew us also according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself for His economy (Eph. 1:9-10). This was His heart&rsquo;s desire, which was not of man but altogether of Him. According to His desire, His good pleasure, He foreknew a group of people that He might work in them to carry out His economy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. GOD&rsquo;S SELECTION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Before the Foundation of the World</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s selection took place before the foundation of the world, in eternity past (Eph. 1:4). Before the creation of man, God foreknew and chose us. The expression &ldquo;before the foundation of the world&rdquo; implies the creation of the entire universe. Hence, God&rsquo;s choosing us before the foundation of the world indicates that the universe was founded for man&rsquo;s existence to fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. God chose us before the foundation of the world, and through the creation of the universe He made it possible for man to exist to fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. In Christ</h2>
<p>God also chose us in Christ (Eph. 1:4). &ldquo;In Christ&rdquo; indicates that Christ is the virtue, the instrument, and the sphere in which God has blessed us. It was in Christ as the sphere that we were selected by God. Outside of the sphere of Christ, it is not possible for man to be chosen or blessed by God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Because of Love</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s selection was also made because of love (1 Thes. 1:4). This love is the love with which God loves us. God chose us because He loved us, and He loved us without reason. Because of His love, He favored us and chose us as the object of His heart&rsquo;s love.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Through God&rsquo;s Mercy</h2>
<p>God chose us through His mercy. It is not of our works nor of our willing or running, but of God, the One who shows mercy (Rom. 9:11, 15-16). When Esau and Jacob were in their mother&rsquo;s womb, not yet being born, nor having done anything good or bad, God told their mother that He chose the lesser, Jacob, but rejected the greater, Esau. This proves that God did not choose Jacob because his works were good, nor did He reject Esau because his works were bad; for at that time they were not yet born, nor had they done anything good or bad. After their birth, as far as their conduct was concerned, Jacob was worse than Esau, yet God&rsquo;s selection did not change. Therefore, God chose us not because of our works but because of Himself. He will have mercy on whom He will have mercy; He will choose whom He will choose. It is entirely of His mercy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. By God&rsquo;s Grace</h2>
<p>The fact that God chose us because of His mercy, not because of our works, indicates that God&rsquo;s selection was by His grace (Rom. 11:5-6). The selection of His grace came to us through His mercy. God&rsquo;s mercy comes out of His love. His mercy enables His love to reach us and visit us. Although we were fallen, unfit, and unworthy, in His mercy He lifted us out of the undeserving position and made us worthy to receive His grace and enjoy His love. Hence, His selection is a selection of grace which is out of love and through mercy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. That the Believers Should Be Holy<br />
and without Blemish</h2>
<p>God chose the believers that they should be holy and without blemish before Him (Eph. 1:4).</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Before God</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Before God&rdquo; means to be according to God&rsquo;s divine standard. We will be holy and without blemish, not according to our standard or in our eyes, but according to His standard and in His eyes. This qualifies us to remain in and enjoy His presence.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. To Be Holy</h2>
<p>God chose us that we should be holy. Holiness is neither sinlessness nor perfection. Holy means not only sanctified, separated unto God, but also different, distinct, from everything that is common. In the universe, only God is different, distinct, from everything. Hence, He is holy; holiness is His nature.</p>
<p>The way God makes us holy is to impart Himself, the holy One, into us so that we may partake of His divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4), even to be permeated and saturated with His holy nature. Eventually, our whole being will be made holy, like God Himself, in His nature and in His character.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Without Blemish</h2>
<p>God chose us that we also should be without blemish. A blemish may refer to an impure substance in a precious gem. Through the fall, many impure elements, such as the flesh, the self, and the world, entered into God&rsquo;s chosen ones, causing them to become blemished. Hence, God is working in us to saturate us with His holy element and remove all impurities, so that we may be permeated, outwardly and inwardly, with God&rsquo;s holy nature and be without blemish.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. GOD&rsquo;S PREDESTINATION</h2>
<p>Those whom God foreknew and chose, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son and to receive sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself (Rom. 8:29; Eph. 1:4-5). The goal of God&rsquo;s predestination is sonship. We were predestinated to be sons of God even before we were created. Hence, as God&rsquo;s creatures, we need to be begotten of Him so that we may participate in His life to be His sons and have the position to inherit all His riches.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Before the Ages</h2>
<p>God not only chose us before the foundation of the world, but also predestinated us before the ages unto glory (1 Cor. 2:7). When God chose us, He also predestinated us. These two matters were done by God before the ages, in eternity past. Hence, according to God&rsquo;s selection and predestination, God determined our destiny in eternity past. This destiny is not only that we should be holy and without blemish, but even more that we should be conformed to the image of His Son, receive sonship, and be brought into His glory.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. According to God&rsquo;s Foreknowledge</h2>
<p>God chose and predestinated us according to His foreknowledge (Rom. 8:29; 1 Pet. 1:2). This indicates that our relationship with God was initiated by God according to His foreknowledge.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. According to the Good Pleasure of God&rsquo;s Will</h2>
<p>God predestinated us according to the good pleasure of His will (Eph. 1:5). This reveals that God has a will in which is His good pleasure. God predestinated us to be His sons according to this pleasure, according to the desire of His heart.</p><h2 class="head2">D. According to God&rsquo;s Purpose</h2>
<p>God predestinated us not only according to the good pleasure of His will, but also with a purpose, a plan (Eph. 1:11). It is according to His purpose that He predestinated us. His purpose was the plan which He made according to His will, that we might partake of His life and nature and have the position to enjoy and inherit all His riches.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. That the Believers May Receive Sonship<br />
through Jesus Christ</h2>
<p>God predestinated us unto sonship through Jesus Christ (Eph. 1:5). &ldquo;Through Jesus Christ&rdquo; means through the Redeemer who is the Son of God. Through Him we were redeemed to be the sons of God with the life and position of God&rsquo;s sons. Eventually, we will be glorified with Him (Rom. 8:17b) and manifested with Him in glory (Col. 3:4).</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. To Have Eternal Life</h2>
<p>Since God predestinated us unto sonship, He foreordained us to have His life, the eternal life (Acts 13:48). Once we believe in the Lord Jesus, we have this eternal life (1 John 5:12), and we are born of Him to be His children (John 1:12).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. To Be Conformed to the Image of God&rsquo;s Son</h2>
<p>God chose and predestinated us according to His foreknowledge in order to conform us to the image of His Son (Rom. 8:29). Christ, the Son of God, is the mold. God has put us into Him (1 Cor. 1:30) to conform us to His image to be His many brothers, that He should be the Firstborn among us. Through this, the only begotten Son becomes the firstborn Son among many brothers. He is the firstborn Son, and we are the many sons to express God in a corporate way.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. To Receive Sonship</h2>
<p>God predestinated us not only that we should be conformed to the image of His Son, but that we should also receive sonship (Eph. 1:5). By conformation we are brought into the reality of sonship. When we are born again, only our spirit is in the sonship, not our soul or our body. This sonship will spread outward from our spirit until it saturates our whole being. At the time of the Lord&rsquo;s return our physical body will also be saturated with the sonship and be transfigured. This is the redemption of our body (Rom. 8:23). At that time we will be brought wholly into sonship. Every part of our being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;will be in the completion of sonship.</p>
<p>Today we are undergoing the process of sonship. We have the Spirit of the Son and the life of the Son in us, sanctifying us, transforming us, and conforming us to the image of God&rsquo;s Son. Furthermore, we have the position of the Son (John 20:17) that we may have the legal right to inherit all that God the Father is and all that He has. Eventually, we will inherit all that God is for eternity (Rev. 21:7).</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. To Obtain Glory</h2>
<p>God not only predestinated us to have eternal life, to be conformed to the image of His Son, and to receive sonship, but He also foreordained us to obtain His glory (1 Cor. 2:7) that we might express Him. God&rsquo;s glory is God expressed. We are vessels of mercy which He has before prepared unto glory (Rom. 9:23), and He has called us into this glory (2 Thes. 2:14; 1 Pet. 5:10). Christ Himself is our hope of glory (Col. 1:27), and today we exult and boast in this hope of glory (Rom. 5:2). When this hope, Christ, is manifested, then we will also be manifested with Him in glory (Col. 3:4). That will be the redemption of our body, the transfiguration of our body. At that time, God&rsquo;s glory will be expressed from our spirit to our soul and through our body. The three parts of our whole being will be the same as Christ is and be fully saturated with God&rsquo;s glory. This is to be glorified, which is the ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s full salvation. It is also the ultimate goal to which God predestined us in eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Although man&rsquo;s fall was tragic, before the foundation of the world and in His sovereign ordination, God foreknew, chose, and predestinated a group of people to receive His salvation that His purpose in man might be fulfilled. According to His foreknowledge and His good pleasure, He chose us in eternity past that we should be holy and without blemish before Him. His selection is a selection of grace which was out of His love and through His mercy. Furthermore, according to the good pleasure of His will and according to His purpose, He predestinated us before the ages that we should obtain glory. This means that we should receive sonship through Jesus Christ to have the Spirit of the Son, the life of the Son, and the position of the Son, and to be conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s Son. Eventually, our whole being with its three parts&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;will look exactly like Christ and be fully saturated with God&rsquo;s glory. This is the ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s full salvation. It is also the ultimate goal to which God foreknew, chose, and predestinated us in eternity past.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson and in the next we shall focus on God&rsquo;s calling. God&rsquo;s calling is the first thing that God does in His chosen ones in the initial stage of His full salvation. In order to fulfill His purpose of selecting and predestinating man in eternity past, God comes in time, under His sovereign arrangement, to call His chosen ones that He may bring them back to His original intention to receive all the blessings that He intends to give them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF GOD&rsquo;S CALLING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The New Beginning of God</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s calling is God&rsquo;s new beginning. When God created man, there was a beginning. However, because man was corrupted and spoiled by Satan, he fell. Nevertheless, God would not give up man. His purpose in man never changes. So God came in to call man in order that He might have a new beginning with fallen man, and that His called ones also might have a new beginning and a change in their life, their concept, and even their entire being. This is God&rsquo;s calling.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Transfer of Race</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s calling is a transfer of race. God&rsquo;s calling of Abraham meant that He had given up the race of Adam and had chosen Abraham, with his descendants, as the new race (Gen. 12:2-3; Gal. 3:7-9, 14; Rom. 4:16-17) to be His people for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose. All the called ones have been transferred from the created race to the called race. Although we were born into the Adamic race, at the time of our calling we were transferred into the Abrahamic race, the race of the called ones. Hence, God&rsquo;s calling is a transfer of race.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Transfer of Life</h2>
<p>The transfer of race is actually the transfer of life. The transfer of life is a transfer from the life of Adam to the life of Christ. This is also a transfer from the life of the old creation to the life of the new creation. Because of the fall of man, all of God&rsquo;s original creation became old and is no longer able to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose. Therefore, God needs a new creation, a creation with a life that is stronger and much better than the created life of Adam. This life is the uncreated life of God, the life of Christ. The transfer of life in God&rsquo;s calling is from the fallen life of the old creation to this stronger and better life of the new creation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. GOD&rsquo;S CALLING</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s calling originates with and is initiated by God. Romans 1:7 shows that all the saints are beloved of God and called by God. In eternity past God foreknew, chose, and predestinated us (Eph. 1:4; Rom. 8:29-30); in time He created us. However, we fell (Rom. 5:12), falling into sin, the self, the flesh, the world, and the old creation. Hence, God came to call us out of everything that is other than God Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. According to God&rsquo;s Predestination</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s calling is according to His predestination (Rom. 8:30). In eternity past He foreknew, chose, and predestinated us (1 Pet. 1:1-2; Eph. 1:4-5). Moreover, according to His predestination, in time He called us, justified us, and glorified us. This was foreordained in eternity by God, with whom is no variableness (James 1:17), according to His purpose and plan.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. According to God&rsquo;s Purpose</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s calling is not only according to His predestination but also according to His purpose (Rom. 8:28b; 2 Tim. 1:9a). His purpose is His plan according to His will to place us into Christ, making us one with Him to share His life and position that we may be His testimony. According to such a purpose, such a plan, God predestinated us in eternity past and called us in time.</p><h2 class="head2">C. According to God&rsquo;s Grace</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s calling is also according to His grace (2 Tim. 1:9-10). This grace was given to us in Christ by God before times eternal. It was according to this grace that God called us. This grace has been manifested through the first coming of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who nullified death and brought life and incorruption to us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Through God&rsquo;s Own Glory and Virtue</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s calling is also through His own glory and virtue (2 Pet. 1:3). Glory is the goal of the divine calling; virtue is the energy to reach the goal.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Glory as the Goal of the Divine Calling</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s calling has a goal. He called us to bring us into His glory. He not only called us through His glory, but He also called us to His glory. When Christ came to the earth, He, as the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory (Heb. 1:3), became a great light shining in darkness and in the shadow of death (Matt. 4:16), attracting and calling people to follow Him (Matt. 4:19-22). Then He continued to attract the disciples with His glory in cases such as His changing the water into wine (John 2:2-11), His transfiguration on the mountain (Matt. 17:1-2), and His resurrecting of Lazarus in Bethany (John 11:39-40, 43-44). In these cases He revealed His glory to them again and again. He also gave them this glory (John 17:22) that they might have God&rsquo;s life and nature (John 17:2-3; 2 Pet. 1:4) and become one to be God&rsquo;s corporate expression. After His death and resurrection, He entered into the disciples with His glory (Luke 24:26; John 20:22) so that they might share His glory. Then on the day of Pentecost, this ascended and glorified Christ poured Himself out, and Peter and the rest of the disciples were filled with glory and were in a situation that was full of glory (Acts 2). Eventually, when Christ comes again, this glory will be expressed through the believers&rsquo; whole being&mdash;their spirit, soul, and body. At that time, they will be manifested with Him in glory (Col. 3:4). This is the glory into which we have been called.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Virtue as the Energy of Life to Reach the Goal</h2>
<p>God called us not only through His glory but also through His virtue. Virtue, literally meaning excellency, denotes the energy of life to overcome all obstacles and to carry out all excellent attributes. Glory is the goal of the divine calling; virtue is the energy of life to reach the goal. God has called us and imparted life into us (2 Pet. 1:3), and the divine energy of this life is virtue. This virtue needs to be developed (2 Pet. 1:5-8) to become our strength that we may reach the goal of God&rsquo;s calling and enter into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ (2 Pet. 1:11), which is to enter into the eternal glory of God (1 Pet. 5:10).</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. In Christ</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s calling is in Christ (1 Pet. 5:10). He did not call us outside of Christ; He called us in Christ as the sphere. &ldquo;In Christ&rdquo; also indicates that the God of all grace has gone through all the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to accomplish the complete and full redemption, that He may bring His believers into an organic union with Himself. Thus they may participate in the riches of the Triune God as their enjoyment. Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God (Col. 2:9), has become the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17) as the bountiful life supply to us (Phil. 1:19b). It is in this Christ, through His all-inclusive redemption and based upon all His achievements, that God can be the God of all grace to call us into His eternal glory, and to perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground us in the Triune God as the solid foundation, thus enabling us to attain to His glorious goal.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Through the Gospel</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s calling is also through the gospel preached by the sent ones (2 Thes. 2:14). The gospel is the Son of God, our Lord Jesus Christ (Rom. 1:1-3; Acts 5:42b), with His person, with all that He has accomplished, attained, and obtained, and with all that He is accomplishing in this age and will accomplish in the coming age and in eternity as the contents. Such a Christ must be preached as the gospel, the glad tidings, by God&rsquo;s sent ones, that God&rsquo;s called ones may hear and receive Him (Rom. 10:14-15), thus fulfilling God&rsquo;s plan in eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s calling is the first thing that God does in His chosen ones in the initial stage of His full salvation. This is God&rsquo;s new beginning in which He calls men out of the created Adamic race and transfers them into the called Abrahamic race, and out of the life of the old creation into the life of the new creation. God&rsquo;s calling is according to His predestination, purpose, and grace, and through His glory and virtue. This virtue becomes the energy of life by which the believers reach the goal of God&rsquo;s calling, that is, to enter into the eternal glory of God. God&rsquo;s calling is in Christ; Christ is its sphere. It is in Christ, through His all-inclusive redemption and based upon all His achievements, that God can call the believers into His eternal glory. God&rsquo;s calling is also through the gospel preached by God&rsquo;s sent ones so that God&rsquo;s called ones may hear and receive Christ.</p>

</ol>
<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we shall continue to see God&rsquo;s calling.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. A HOLY CALLING</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s calling is a holy calling (2 Tim. 1:9a). God has called the believers that He may separate them from all the common things and sanctify them unto Himself for His own purpose. Hence, God&rsquo;s calling is a holy calling.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. A HEAVENLY CALLING</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s calling is a heavenly calling (Heb. 3:1), the high calling (Phil. 3:14). The Greek word for &ldquo;high&rdquo; literally means above. Hence, the high calling is the calling from above, from the heavens, by God. It is equivalent to the heavenly calling. God&rsquo;s calling to the children of Israel was a low calling, an earthly calling, to receive the earthly blessing for the possession of the physical land. God&rsquo;s calling to the believers, however, is a high calling, a heavenly calling, to receive the heavenly blessing for the possession of the all-inclusive Christ and all His riches.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. A Calling of the Divine Hope</h2>
<p>This heavenly calling is a calling of the divine hope (Eph. 1:18a; 4:4). As God&rsquo;s called people, we are full of hope. Colossians 1:27 says that Christ in us is the hope of glory. Hence, our hope is Christ Himself. We are called with a calling of the divine hope to possess, partake of, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ, who is the embodiment of the processed Triune God. Today He is our life and hope (Col. 3:4; 1:27; Eph. 4:4); in the future He will be our glory and inheritance (1 Pet. 5:1; 1:4). In this age we live by, experience, and enjoy the life of Christ, and we also pursue diligently the growth and development of life unto maturity. When Christ our hope comes again, He will redeem our fallen and corrupted body (Rom. 8:23) by transfiguring it and making it the same as the body of His glory (Phil. 3:21). He will conform us to His glorious image (Rom. 8:29), making us holy and absolutely like Him in our regenerated spirit, transformed soul, and transfigured body. He will glorify us (Rom. 8:30), immersing us in His glory (Heb. 2:10) that we may enter into His heavenly kingdom (2 Tim. 4:18; 2 Pet. 1:11), the kingdom into which He has called us (1 Thes. 2:12). He will enable us to inherit the inheritance, incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, kept in the heavens for us (1 Pet. 1:4). He even will cause us to reign together with Him as kings and to share His joy (Matt. 25:21, 23). This is the calling of the divine hope which we have received.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. A Walk Worthy of the Calling</h2>
<p>We were called with the heavenly calling to walk worthily in the church (Eph. 4:1). Our walk in the church should be worthy of the calling with which we were called. Hence, we need to be transformed that we may have a proper, normal humanity, living a life of lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, bearing one another in love, and being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace (Eph. 4:2-3). Furthermore, we need to have seven things as the base of our oneness: one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God (Eph. 4:4-6). Thus, we can live a life that is worthy of the calling with which we were called.</p>
<p>The heavenly calling also supplies us with the reality of the Triune God, which is the unsearchable riches of Christ (Eph. 3:8b) and His immeasurable dimensions (Eph. 3:18), that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God (Eph. 3:19b) for God&rsquo;s expression (Eph. 3:21). The riches of Christ are what Christ is to us, such as light, life, righteousness, and holiness. These riches are unsearchable and untraceable. The immeasurable dimensions of Christ are the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth of the universe (Eph. 3:18), that we may experience Christ in His breadth, length, height, and depth, without limit.</p>
<p>To walk in the church worthily of God&rsquo;s calling, we need to enjoy continually what Christ is and has, allowing Him to impart God&rsquo;s riches into us, that we may be filled even unto the fullness of God for the expression of God. This is the proper condition of the church; this is also the proper living of the called ones.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE PURPOSE OF GOD&rsquo;S CALLING&mdash;<br />
THAT THE BELIEVERS MAY:</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Come out of Darkness<br />
and Enter into God&rsquo;s Marvelous Light</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s calling is that He may bring man out of darkness into His marvelous light (1 Pet. 2:9b). Due to man&rsquo;s fall, sin and death came upon all men and caused them to fall into darkness. Darkness is a sign of sin and death; it is the expression and sphere of Satan in death. The fact that mankind is in darkness proves that mankind is under the authority of Satan and dead in offenses and sins (Eph. 2:1). When God comes to call man, He opens man&rsquo;s eyes and turns man from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to Himself. Light is a sign of righteousness and life; it is the expression and sphere of God in life. To be turned to God means to be turned to the authority of God, which is God&rsquo;s kingdom of light. God has called us that He may deliver us out of the death-realm of Satan&rsquo;s darkness into the life-realm of God&rsquo;s marvelous light.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Be Made Holy unto God</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s calling is that His chosen ones may be separated and made holy unto God, to be the holy ones, the saints. Both Romans 1:7 and 1 Corinthians 1:2 reveal that the believers are the called saints. The saints are produced through the calling of the sanctifying God, who called them out of the world unto Himself. Hence, God&rsquo;s calling is a separation and a sanctification. Therefore, not only Peter and Paul were saints, but all God&rsquo;s called ones are saints, holy ones.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Enter into the Fellowship of Christ</h2>
<p>God has called us that we may also enter into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord (1 Cor. 1:9), to partake of and enjoy His all-inclusive riches. This all-inclusive Christ is the embodiment of the processed Triune God (Col. 2:9). According to the revelation in 1 Corinthians, Christ is the portion of the saints (1:2); He is God&rsquo;s power and God&rsquo;s wisdom as righteousness, sanctification, and redemption to us (1:24, 30); He is our glory (2:7) and the Lord of glory (2:8); He is the depths of God (2:10); He is the unique foundation of God&rsquo;s building (3:11); He is our Passover (5:7), the unleavened bread (5:8), the spiritual food, the spiritual drink, and the spiritual rock (10:3-4); He is the Head (11:3) and the Body (12:12); He is the firstfruit (15:20, 23), the second Man (15:47), and the last Adam (15:45b); and as such He became the life-giving Spirit (15:45b). We were called by God into the fellowship of such an all-inclusive Christ that we may enjoy Him as our God-given eternal portion.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Endure the Suffering of Christ</h2>
<p>God not only called us out of darkness into His marvelous light and into the fellowship of His Son, our Lord Jesus, but He also called us to the suffering of Christ. First Peter 2:20 and 21 say, &ldquo;For what credit is it if sinning and being buffeted you shall endure it? But if doing good and suffering you shall endure, this is grace with God. For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered on your behalf, leaving you a model that you should follow in His steps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For our sake Christ humbled Himself to become a man, being born into a poor family. He was despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief (Isa. 52:14; 53:2-3). He was without sin and had never sinned (Heb. 4:15; 1 Pet. 2:22), yet He was oppressed and afflicted. Being reviled, He did not revile in return; suffering, He did not threaten (1 Pet. 2:23). He bore our griefs and carried our sorrows; He was wounded for our transgressions and was bruised for our iniquities (Isa. 53:4-5). Finally, He Himself carried up our sins in His body onto the tree (1 Pet. 2:24). He suffered on our behalf and left us a model so that we should follow in His steps.</p>
<p>Literally, the Greek word for &ldquo;model&rdquo; means an under-writing. The Lord Jesus has set His suffering life before us as an under-writing for us to copy by tracing that He may be reproduced in us. This is spiritual xeroxing: Christ Himself is the original copy, the Spirit is the light, the divine life is the ink, and we are the paper for Christ to be reproduced in us. While we are bearing sorrows, suffering unjustly, we experience the grace of God, enjoying the motivation of the divine life within us and its expression in our life, that in our behavior we may become a reproduction of Christ, suffering as He suffered and living as He lived. This is God&rsquo;s calling us to the suffering of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Enter into the Peace of Christ</h2>
<p>For the unique Body of Christ God has called us also to the peace of Christ. Colossians 3:15 says, &ldquo;And let the peace of Christ arbitrate in your hearts, to which also you were called in one Body.&rdquo; This indicates that for the proper Body life we need the peace of Christ to arbitrate, to adjust, to decide, all things in our hearts in the relationships among the members of His Body. Because the church life has been invaded by the differences of races, religious observances, cultural backgrounds, and classes and by the various philosophies and isms, there is a lack of the peace of Christ in the believers&rsquo; experience. They even have disputes with one another and are divided into parties, so that eventually there is a loss of the oneness of the Body of Christ. At this time an arbitrator is needed. This arbitrator is not any brother in the church; it is the very peace of Christ. We should allow the peace of Christ to arbitrate in our hearts. We all must take heed to the word of the arbitrator, allowing the presiding peace of Christ to rule within us and settle all the disputes among us, thus maintaining the oneness of the Body of Christ. This is the peace to which God has called us in one Body.</p>
<p>After Paul wrote in the book of Colossians concerning the all-inclusive Christ and concerning the new man in whom Christ is all and in all and where there is no room for Greek, Jew, or other cultural distinctions, he charged the saints to care for the peace of Christ. This is the peace of which Paul speaks in Ephesians 2:15, where we are told that in Himself Christ created one new man out of two peoples, thus making peace. In the new man there is no Greek, Jew, circumcision, or uncircumcision, and there are no different races, classes, or nationalities. Rather, there is oneness because Christ is all and in all. The peaceful oneness in the new man is simply the peace of Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Obtain the Glory of Christ</h2>
<p>God has called us also for the purpose that we may obtain the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ (2 Thes. 2:14). Man was created in the image of God and after the likeness of God that man might contain God and express God. After man sinned and fell, God&rsquo;s original purpose in creating man was lost; man could no longer contain or express God. God, however, accomplished redemption for man, and He called His chosen ones unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth that they might obtain the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ (2 Thes. 2:13-14). The glory of the Lord Jesus Christ is that Christ is the Son of God the Father, possessing the Father&rsquo;s life and nature to express Him. To obtain the glory of Christ is to be in the same position as sons of God to express Him.</p>
<p>In John 17:22 the Lord said in His prayer to the Father, &ldquo;And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one.&rdquo; The glory which the Father has given the Son is the sonship with the Father&rsquo;s life and divine nature (John 5:26) to express the Father in His fullness (John 1:18; 14:9; Col. 2:9; Heb. 1:3). Through His death and resurrection the Son has given this glory to His believers that they also may have the sonship with the Father&rsquo;s life and divine nature (John 17:2; 2 Pet. 1:4) to express the Father in the fullness of the Son (John 1:16). This is God&rsquo;s calling us unto the obtaining of the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. Enter into the Eternal Glory of God</h2>
<p>God has called the believers not only unto the obtaining of the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ, but also into the eternal glory of God (1 Pet. 5:10). For this, the God of all grace is ministering to us the riches of the bountiful supply of the divine life in many aspects and in many steps of the divine operation on and in us in God&rsquo;s economy. The initial step is to call us, and the consummate step is to glorify us. Between these two steps are His loving care while He is disciplining us and His perfecting, establishing, strengthening, and grounding work in us. In all these divine acts, the bountiful supply of the divine life is ministered to us as grace in varied experiences, that we may enter into His eternal glory and express the God of all grace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. Enter into the Kingdom of God</h2>
<p>God has called us also into His kingdom (1 Thes. 2:12). The kingdom of God is an organism constituted with God&rsquo;s divine life as the realm of life for His ruling, in which He reigns by His divine life and expresses Himself in the divine life. This kingdom began with the saints in the Old Testament and is realized in the church in this age, and it will be completed in the New Jerusalem in the millennium and ultimately consummated in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.</p>
<p>Before we were called we were outside the kingdom of God, having nothing to do with God. However, God called us to partake of His divine life and nature that we may enter into the kingdom of God. Today we, the called ones, must live in the church that we may grow and develop in the life of God unto full maturity. Thus, we shall be richly and bountifully supplied with the entrance into the millennial kingdom in the coming age and into the new heaven and new earth in eternity within the kingdom of God, in which we shall reign as kings (Rev. 22:5b).</p>
<p>Therefore, the purpose of God&rsquo;s calling is that we may come out of darkness and enter into God&rsquo;s marvelous light, become those who are sanctified unto God, enter into the fellowship of the Lord Jesus Christ, endure the suffering of Christ, enter into the peace of Christ, obtain the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ, enter into the eternal glory of God, and be richly and bountifully supplied with the entrance into the kingdom of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s calling is a holy calling as well as a heavenly calling. The believers were called with the heavenly calling to possess, partake of, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ, who is the embodiment of the processed Triune God. Today He is our life and hope; in the future He will be our glory and inheritance. This Christ supplies us with His unsearchable riches and immeasurable dimensions that we may live in the church life and have a walk which is worthy of the heavenly calling. The purpose of God&rsquo;s calling is that we, the believers, may come out of darkness and enter into the marvelous light of God, out of the death-realm of Satan&rsquo;s darkness into the life-realm of God&rsquo;s marvelous light, and be made holy unto God; that we may enter into the fellowship of Christ to enjoy Him as the eternal portion given by God to us; that we may endure the suffering of Christ to follow in His steps and live the life that He lived; that we may enter into the peace of Christ to allow Him to be the Arbitrator for the keeping of the oneness of His Body; that we may obtain the glory of Christ to express the Father in Christ in His fullness, that we may enter into the eternal glory of God to express the God of all grace; and that we may enter into the kingdom of God to reign in it and enjoy the eternal blessing of the eternal life of God to the uttermost.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>Immediately after God&rsquo;s calling, the Holy Spirit came to separate man, to sanctify man, so that man would repent and turn to God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE SPIRIT&rsquo;S SANCTIFICATION</h2>
<p>In this lesson, sanctification of the Spirit does not refer to the positional sanctification which comes through the redemption of Christ (Acts 26:18; Heb. 13:12), nor does it refer to the dispositional sanctification which comes after justification through the redemption of Christ (Rom. 6:19, 22). It refers to the sanctification which takes place before faith in Christ and before justification through Christ&rsquo;s redemption (1 Pet. 1:2), in which the Spirit separates man from the world unto the obedience of faith in the redemption of Christ. This indicates that the believers&rsquo; obedience unto faith in Christ results from the Spirit&rsquo;s sanctifying work.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Holy Spirit&rsquo;s Enlightening and Seeking</h2>
<p>The divine title &ldquo;the Holy Spirit&rdquo; indicates God reaching man to separate man unto Himself for His purpose and to make man holy as He is holy. It is by enlightening and seeking man that the Holy Spirit does His sanctifying work. In the second parable in Luke 15 the Lord Jesus speaks of a woman who lights the lamp, sweeps the house, and seeks carefully until she finds the lost coin. This signifies the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit uses the word of God (Psa. 119:130), which is the Bible, to enlighten and expose the sinner&rsquo;s position and condition and also to cleanse and search carefully within him so that he may repent. Thus, the Holy Spirit brings the lost sinner, who is a treasure in the eyes of God, back to God.</p>
<p>Hebrews 6:4 and Acts 26:18 tell us that this enlightening of the Holy Spirit is also to open the eyes of sinners and to turn them from darkness to light, that they may see the divine, spiritual things; it is also to turn them from the authority of Satan to God. Therefore, the enlightening of the Holy Spirit results in the sinners&rsquo; repentance and turning to God. The awakening of the prodigal son in Luke 15 is due to the enlightening and searching of the fine woman. Our repentance is the result of the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s enlightening, seeking, and sanctifying.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Spirit Convicting Man<br />
concerning Sin, concerning Righteousness,<br />
and concerning Judgment</h2>
<p>In John 16:8 the Lord said of the Spirit that &ldquo;He will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment.&rdquo; The Spirit convicts man, first, concerning sin; second, concerning righteousness; and third, concerning judgment. Each of these items is related to a person. Sin is related to Adam, for it was through Adam that sin entered the human race (Rom. 5:12). Righteousness is related to Christ because righteousness comes from Christ and even is the resurrected Christ Himself (John 16:10; 1 Cor. 1:30). Judgment is related to Satan because judgment is for Satan.</p>
<p>The Spirit convicts men concerning sin because they do not believe in the Lord Jesus (John 16:9). He enlightens men and reveals their sins, causing them to see that they are sinful, that they were born in sin, and that if they do not believe in the Lord Jesus they will die in their sins (John 8:24). He also causes men to see that in Adam they have been condemned already (John 3:18). If they do not believe in the Lord Jesus now, they can only wait for death under condemnation. Moreover, the Spirit causes men to see that today God wants men to believe in Jesus; this is not only God&rsquo;s grace to sinners, but also God&rsquo;s command to them. If a sinner does not believe in the Lord Jesus, he is not only rejecting God&rsquo;s grace but also resisting His command. Therefore, unbelief is a sin, an exceedingly great sin, that is sufficient to cause a person to perish forever (Rev. 21:8). Since man is sinful and has been condemned already, all that God can ask man to do now is to believe in the Lord Jesus. To believe in the Lord Jesus is God&rsquo;s unique command for sinners today. Therefore, if a man does not believe in the Lord Jesus today, he violates God&rsquo;s unique command and commits the unique sin. The Spirit causes men to see this, thus convicting them.</p>
<p>The Spirit convicts men concerning righteousness because the Lord Jesus has resurrected and ascended to God (John 16:10). He also causes men to see that the Lord Jesus was made sin on our behalf, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him (2 Cor. 5:21), He has borne our sins on the cross (1 Pet. 2:24), satisfying God&rsquo;s righteous requirement. Hence, God raised Him from among the dead that we might be justified, and that He might be the proof of our justification (Rom. 4:25). Furthermore, He has ascended into heaven and is sitting at the right hand of God, proving that His death has solved our problem of sins once for all (Heb. 10:12), satisfying God&rsquo;s righteous requirement. Now God can, and must, according to His righteousness, justify the ones who believe in Him. Hence, if men do not believe in the Lord Jesus, the Spirit will convict them concerning this.</p>
<p>The Spirit convicts men concerning judgment because the ruler of this world has been judged (John 16:11). He causes men to see that Satan, the ruler of the world, who opposes God and is at enmity with God, has been already judged on the cross of Christ. Any man who does not repent and believe into Christ will remain in sins to share with Satan the judgment that he will suffer for eternity. Therefore, men should repent, break away from Satan and the world that belongs to him, and turn to God. Since Satan has been judged on the cross of Christ, he no longer has dominion over those who believe in Christ. Thus, men can be delivered out of Satan&rsquo;s rule through Christ and His cross. If anyone would still remain under Satan&rsquo;s hand and be an enemy of God, he will share in God&rsquo;s judgment upon Satan. The Spirit causes men to see this and convicts men concerning this.</p>
<p>Hence, the Spirit&rsquo;s convicting man concerning sin, concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment is equivalent to His convicting man concerning the content of the entire gospel. The Spirit causes man to see that in Adam he is sinful and condemned; that in Christ he can be righteous and justified; and that if he remains in Adam he belongs to Satan and is judged. On the cross Christ solved man&rsquo;s problem of sin, fulfilled God&rsquo;s righteousness, and judged Satan. If a man believes in Christ, he will be delivered from his sin, obtain God&rsquo;s righteousness, and be spared of the judgment that Satan will suffer. Otherwise, he will remain in his sins, and he will have no share in God&rsquo;s righteousness. Eventually he will suffer the judgment of Satan and enter into the eternal fire prepared for Satan to be his companion in suffering the eternal punishment (Matt. 25:41). When a person has such a vision, spontaneously he will repent and turn to God.</p><h2 class="head1">II. MAN&rsquo;S REPENTANCE</h2>
<p>Man&rsquo;s repentance is the result of the Spirit&rsquo;s sanctifying work. When the Spirit comes to enlighten man, seek man, and convict man concerning sin, concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment, He causes man to repent and turn to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Meaning of Repentance</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. To Have a Change of Mind</h2>
<p>The Greek word for repentance means to have a change of mind issuing in regret, to have a turn in purpose. Therefore, to repent, as taught in the Bible, is to have a change of mind. It is not to improve or reform oneself nor to forsake the evil and turn to the good, as people generally believe. Since the fall of man, man&rsquo;s mind has been turned against God and directed toward many persons, things, and matters other than God. Furthermore, man is controlled by his mind, doing the desires of the thoughts (Eph. 2:3). The desires of man&rsquo;s thoughts, whether they are good or bad, are always contrary to God and are directed toward persons, things, and matters other than God. Because of this, man also behaves himself in a way that is contrary to God and is thus directed toward persons, things, and matters other than God. Therefore, man should repent and have a change in his mind so that his conduct and behavior may also change accordingly.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. To Turn from Things Other Than God<br />
to the Kingdom of God</h2>
<p>Man&rsquo;s repentance is also his turning from things other than God to the kingdom of God. Repentance in the preaching of John the Baptist, as the opening of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, was to have a change of mind and repent for the kingdom of God (Matt. 3:2). The Lord Jesus continued His forerunner&rsquo;s preaching of the gospel of the kingdom of God (Matt. 4:17). This indicates that God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is focused on His kingdom. For this we should repent, change our mind, have a turn in our pursuit and purpose of life, turning from persons, things, and matters other than God to the kingdom of God, that we may live under the ruling, the reigning, of God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. To Turn from All Things to God Himself</h2>
<p>Man&rsquo;s repentance is also his turning from all things to God Himself (Acts 26:20; 14:15b; 1 Thes. 1:9b). Originally man&rsquo;s mind was toward all things outside of God; hence, under its direction, all of man&rsquo;s behavior and actions were also against God. Under the control of his mind, fallen man is against God in all things. Just as man&rsquo;s committing sins and doing evil are contrary to God, so also are his doing good and practicing justice. When man commits sin and does evil, he is turned toward evil and not toward God; in the same manner, when he does good and practices justice, he is turned toward goodness and justice and not toward God. When a man is stingy and loves money, he is turned toward money and not toward God; when he delights to do good and give to the needy, he is turned toward doing good and giving to the needy, not toward God. Man&rsquo;s pursuit is toward many things and not in any way toward God. Every thought and every action of man has a goal, but none of these goals is God Himself. Man wants everything except God. Therefore, man needs to repent and turn to God. He must have a change in his mind; then his outward conduct and behavior will also be changed accordingly. Eventually, his life and his entire being will be turned toward God.</p>
<p>If a man&rsquo;s repentance does not issue in his turning to God, it is a repentance that the world approves, but not the repentance that God desires. The repentance that God desires is that man would have a change of mind and turn toward God. Such a repentance is not only to correct man&rsquo;s wrongdoings; it is even more to correct man&rsquo;s condition of rejecting God and being turned away from God. It is not only to change evil into good; it is even more to turn the mind from things other than God to God. Therefore, even those who are considered to be right and good in the eyes of men also need to repent in this way. They need to have a change of mind, turning from the right and the good to God. A person&rsquo;s repentance is nothing less than his change from rejecting God and being turned against God to desiring God and being turned toward God. Real repentance should be a repentance unto God (Acts 20:21), a turning in reality from all things to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Result of Repentance</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. To Receive Forgiveness of Sins</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s gospel causes man to repent and to receive forgiveness of sins (Luke 24:47; 3:3; Acts 2:38). In order to give man the grace of forgiveness, God must first give him the heart of repentance (Acts 5:31). Unless a man repents of his sin of being against God and turns to God from within his heart, he will neither believe in the Lord Jesus nor be able to obtain God&rsquo;s forgiving grace. If a man wants to be forgiven, he must repent. He must repent of his dead works (Heb. 6:1) and turn back to God.</p><h2 class="head3">2. To Receive Life</h2>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s gospel the purpose for man to be forgiven of his sins is that man may receive His life (Col. 2:13). Therefore, if a man desires to receive the Lord&rsquo;s life, he must repent (Acts 11:18). Man must see that his life is corrupt and that his living, which is outside of God, is evil. Seeing this, he is convicted and he loathes himself. As he repents and turns toward God, he is forgiven of his sins and thus obtains the life of God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. To Receive the Gift of the Holy Spirit<br />
and the Divine Inheritance</h2>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s gospel the purpose for men to receive forgiveness of sins is also that they may receive the gift of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38) and the divine inheritance (Acts 26:18). When men repent and turn toward God so that their sins are forgiven, they receive the gift of the Holy Spirit and the divine inheritance. The Holy Spirit, who is the processed Triune God becoming the all-inclusive Spirit, is given to men at the time of their repentance to be the all-inclusive blessing of God&rsquo;s full gospel (Gal. 3:14) that they may enjoy all the riches of the Triune God. The divine inheritance is the Triune God Himself with all that He has, all that He has done, and all that He will do for His redeemed people. This Triune God is embodied in the all-inclusive Christ (Col. 2:9) to be the portion of the saints (Col. 1:12). The Holy Spirit, who has been given to the saints, is the foretaste, the pledge, and the guarantee of this divine inheritance (Eph. 1:14), which we are sharing and enjoying today as a foretaste in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, and will share and enjoy to the uttermost in the coming age and in eternity (1 Pet. 1:4).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Repentance Being a Gift<br />
Given by the Exalted Christ</h2>
<p>Genuine repentance is a gift given to man after Christ was exalted to the right hand of God. After Christ passed through death and resurrection, He was exalted by God to His right hand to be the ruling Leader and Savior, to give repentance and forgiveness of sins to man (Acts 5:31). He rules sovereignly, arranging all of man&rsquo;s environment and the condition of his heart, to lead man to repent and turn to God. Based on His redemption, He gives the grace of forgiveness of sins to the repenting ones that they may obtain salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Repentance Being a Divine Requirement<br />
of God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy</h2>
<p>In God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, God charges all men everywhere to repent (Acts 17:30). God overlooked the times of men&rsquo;s ignorance, but now in the New Testament age He charges all men everywhere to repent and turn to Him. For this, God purposely sent John the Baptist to preach repentance (Matt. 3:2), calling people to repent and turn to Him, thus preparing men&rsquo;s hearts to receive His salvation (Luke 1:77). The Lord Jesus, continuing His forerunner&rsquo;s teaching, also preached repentance (Matt. 4:17) and brought salvation to the repenting ones (Luke 19:9). On the day of Pentecost, when Peter and the eleven disciples stood up, they also taught and exhorted people to repent and receive the gift of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38). When Paul saw the vision of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, he also exhorted those in Damascus, Jerusalem, and all the country of Judea, and the Gentiles, to repent and turn to God (Acts 26:20). This indicates that in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, we must repent to God and turn to Him that we may believe in the gospel (Mark 1:15), believe in the Lord Jesus, receive Him as our Savior (Acts 20:21), enjoy God&rsquo;s salvation, and receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, repentance is a divine requirement of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Repentance Being<br />
a Main Item of the Proclamation<br />
of God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy</h2>
<p>Since repentance is a divine requirement of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, it is a main item which we must proclaim concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. After His resurrection from the dead, the Lord Jesus charged His disciples to proclaim the gospel of repentance for the forgiveness of sins in His name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem (Luke 24:47). Therefore, when we preach the gospel, we should stress this item, telling people to repent that their sins may be forgiven, that they may obtain the eternal life, and that they may receive the gift of the Holy Spirit and the divine inheritance. This is a main item that we should proclaim concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>In the initial stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, immediately after we have been called by God, the Holy Spirit comes to separate us, to sanctify us, that we may repent and turn to God. This sanctification, which takes place before our faith in Christ and before our justification through Christ&rsquo;s redemption, separates us from the world unto the obedience of faith in Christ&rsquo;s redemption. The Holy Spirit does His sanctifying work by enlightening and seeking us, convicting us concerning sin, concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment, thus causing us to repent and turn to God. Our repentance, which is a result of the sanctifying work of the Spirit, causes us to have a change of mind, to turn from things other than God to the kingdom of God and to God Himself. We need to have a turn in our mind, and then our outward conduct and behavior will also change accordingly. Eventually our entire being will be turned toward God. The result of our repentance is that we receive forgiveness of sins, the life of God, and the gift of the Holy Spirit and the divine inheritance. This repentance is a gift given by the exalted Christ, for it is He who gives us the heart of repentance. Repentance is also a divine requirement of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, for He has charged all man everywhere to repent unto Him. Therefore, repentance must be a main item of the believers&rsquo; proclamation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>Following the Spirit&rsquo;s sanctification and man&rsquo;s repentance is man&rsquo;s believing, or man&rsquo;s faith. Genuine faith is always preceded by repentance. In the same manner, genuine repentance is always followed by faith. If a person believes, that proves he has repented; if a person repents, he surely will believe. These two&mdash;faith and repentance&mdash;are intimately related, and neither can exist without the other.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE MEANING OF BELIEVING</h2>
<p>In the previous lesson we saw that the repentance spoken of by the world differs in meaning from the repentance taught in the Bible. Likewise, the believing referred to by man differs in significance from the believing presented in the Word. Man considers that to believe is merely to agree or to acknowledge. But what the Bible speaks concerning faith indicates that it is more than agreeing and acknowledging.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Receiving</h2>
<p>To believe, as taught in the Bible, first means to receive. John 1:12 says, &ldquo;As many as received Him [the Lord Jesus],... those who believe in His name.&rdquo; This shows that to believe is to receive. Therefore, to believe is not merely to agree or to acknowledge, but even more it is to receive. If one assents to the gospel and agrees that the Lord Jesus died to accomplish redemption for man, one still cannot be counted as having believed. Furthermore, even if one acknowledges the gospel and the redemption of Christ, one still cannot be counted as having believed. Believing includes agreeing and acknowledging; nevertheless, the believing itself is the receiving. A person may agree, yet he still may not receive; he also may acknowledge yet still not receive. But a person who receives surely is one who agrees and acknowledges. Therefore, only when a person receives can he be counted as having believed. With our heart we must receive Christ into us to be our Savior. This is the genuine believing.</p>
<p>Christ is the Word who was in the beginning and who was God Himself (John 1:1). He is also the true light who came into the world to enlighten every man (John 1:9). Now in resurrection He has become the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). Therefore, by believing in Him, by receiving Him, we can receive this One, who is the Word, the very God, and the light, into us to be joined to us as one.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Believing into</h2>
<p>To believe is not only to receive but also to &ldquo;believe into&rdquo; (John 1:12; 3:15-16, 36, lit.). To receive is to receive Christ into us and to allow Him to be mingled with us. On the other hand, to &ldquo;believe into&rdquo; is to enter into Christ and be joined to Him. One who genuinely believes in the Lord Jesus is one who has entered into Him and has been joined to Him through faith. Therefore, the Bible says that a saved person is one who is in Christ (2 Cor. 5:17).</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Believing into the Lord&rsquo;s Name</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s name denotes the Lord&rsquo;s Person, the Lord Himself. To believe into the Lord&rsquo;s name (John 1:12) is to believe into the living Person of the Lord, to believe into the Lord Himself, to be joined to Him as one.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Believing into the Son of God</h2>
<p>John 3:36 and 9:35 and 38 all point out that to believe is to believe into the Son of God. God is the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Father is the source, the Son is the expression, and the Spirit is the entering in. The God who dwells in unapproachable light in heaven is the Father (1 Tim. 6:16; James 1:17); when He is manifested among men, He is the Son (John 1:18; Col. 1:15; Heb. 1:3); and when He enters into man, He is the Spirit (1 John 3:24). The Son, therefore, is the expression of God; He is God expressed. This manifested God is the Lord Jesus, who is the Son of God, the very God Himself (John 1:1). He and God are one (John 10:30). Having passed through death and resurrection, He has become the life-giving Spirit who, like the air, fills all things and is omnipresent. Hence, man can enter into Him through faith to receive the eternal life (John 3:36; 1 John 5:12) and have an organic union with Him.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Believing into the Son of Man,<br />
Who Died and Was Resurrected</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus is not only the Son of God but also the Son of Man, who died and was resurrected (Luke 24:39-43). He was the Son of God, yet He partook of blood and flesh (Heb. 2:14) that He might undo the works of the Devil (1 John 3:8). He put on the likeness of men (Phil. 2:6-7), becoming the Son of Man (Luke 19:10), that through death He might destroy him who has the might of death, that is, the Devil (Heb. 2:14). In Genesis 3 this Devil, who was embodied in the serpent, injected his evil nature into man&rsquo;s body. Later, when the children of Israel sinned against God and were bitten by snakes (Num. 21:4-9), God told Moses to lift up a serpent of brass, which would bear God&rsquo;s judgment in their place, so that anyone who would look at the brass serpent would live. This is a type. In John 3:14-15 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; that everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life.&rdquo; He applied this type to Himself showing that when He became flesh, He came in the likeness of the flesh of sin (Rom. 8:3). Just as the brass serpent had the form of a serpent but did not have the poisonous nature of a serpent, so Christ had the likeness of the flesh of sin, yet He had nothing to do with the sin in the flesh (2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 4:15). When He was lifted up on the cross, the old serpent, Satan, was dealt with by His death in the flesh (John 12:31-33; Heb. 2:14). This means that the serpentine nature within fallen man was dealt with. Furthermore, He was resurrected from among the dead, indicating that all His accomplishments before His death were a success and that they all have eternal efficacy in His resurrection. Therefore, if men would repent and believe into the Son of Man, who died and was resurrected, their sins would be taken away, their evil nature would be dealt with, Satan would be destroyed within them, they would have the eternal life, and they would have an organic union with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. WHAT WE RECEIVE BY BELIEVING</h2>
<p>Once a man believes in the Lord Jesus with the genuine faith mentioned previously, immediately he receives the blessings of forgiveness of sins, washing, sanctification, justification, reconciliation to God, regeneration, eternal life, the Holy Spirit, freedom, and salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Forgiveness of Sins</h2>
<p>Immediately after a person believes in the Lord, he receives forgiveness of sins (Acts 10:43; 26:18). This is the first blessing in God&rsquo;s salvation that a person receives at the time of his believing. When a person believes, God forgives him of all the sins that he has before Him, canceling the charges of sin against him, that he may not be condemned but be delivered from His righteous punishment.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Washing</h2>
<p>After a person believes in the Lord, not only are his sins forgiven, but he is also washed. Forgiveness cancels the charges of sin; washing, on the other hand, removes the trace of sin. Because of a person&rsquo;s faith, the precious blood of Christ washes him from his sins (Rom. 3:25; Rev. 1:5b). After the washing, it is as though that person had never sinned and had never been defiled by sin.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Sanctification</h2>
<p>After a person believes in the Lord, he is not only forgiven of his sins but also sanctified in Christ (1 Cor. 1:30, 2), that is, sanctified unto God in the element and sphere of Christ. Furthermore, through faith man enters within the veil by a new and living way which He has opened for man by His blood (Heb. 10:19-20), to partake of and enjoy this glorified, heavenly, and sanctifying Christ (Heb. 13:12) and to receive an inheritance among those who have been sanctified (Acts 26:18).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Justification</h2>
<p>The Bible says clearly that a man is not and cannot be justified before God by works; he is and can only be justified by faith (Gal. 3:8; 2:16; Rom. 3:22, 28; Acts 13:39). &ldquo;By works&rdquo; is to rely on man&rsquo;s own doing, whereas &ldquo;by faith&rdquo; is to trust in what Christ has done for man. &ldquo;Works&rdquo; require man&rsquo;s effort to do, to perform; &ldquo;faith&rdquo; is man&rsquo;s receiving, obtaining, without effort. No one has the strength to do the works, but everyone can believe.</p>
<p>Faith is to believe in Christ and in what He has done for man. He died and shed His blood to accomplish redemption, satisfying God&rsquo;s righteous demand (Heb. 9:22b), so that God can justify man according to His righteousness (Rom. 5:9; 3:24). Moreover, He has risen from among the dead, proving that His death has satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirement and that man has been justified by God because of His death (Rom. 4:25). But unless a man believes, he still has no share in the redemption accomplished by Christ and cannot be justified through His redemption. Therefore, man must believe, that he may be joined to the Lord and be brought into Him, and that he may receive Him and what He has accomplished for man. Thus, man can participate in Christ and in His redemption and can receive God&rsquo;s justification.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Reconciliation to God</h2>
<p>After the fall men became enemies of God (Rom. 5:10a). Men are in enmity against God and are not subject to the law of God (Rom. 8:7); they do not approve of holding God in their full knowledge (Rom. 1:28); they have no fear of God before their eyes (Rom. 3:18); they hate God (Rom. 1:30) and blaspheme God (1 Tim. 1:13); and they even say that there is no God (Psa. 14:1). Hence, they are sons of disobedience and children of wrath (Eph. 2:2-3). However, through His death and the shedding of His blood on the cross, Christ has made peace between God and man (Rom. 5:10; Col. 1:20). Therefore, when a person believes in the Lord, he can be reconciled to God and also accepted by God through all that the Lord Jesus has accomplished.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Regeneration</h2>
<p>Through the aforementioned items&mdash;forgiveness of sins, washing, sanctification, justification, and reconciliation to God&mdash;the outward problems between man and God have been solved. However, besides having problems with God outwardly, man also has problems inwardly in his life and nature. Therefore, when a person believes in the Lord, God not only solves his problems without but also regenerates him within that he may receive His life and partake of His nature (1 John 5:12; 2 Pet. 1:4). Based on what is revealed in the Bible, man is regenerated, that is, he is begotten of God, at the moment he believes.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. Eternal Life</h2>
<p>The life a person receives at regeneration is the eternal life (John 6:47), the life of God (1 John 1:1-2). Since a person is regenerated at the moment he believes, by this believing he receives the eternal life of God and has passed out of death into life (John 5:24).</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. The Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>Once a person believes in the Lord and is thus regenerated and possesses God&rsquo;s life, God gives to him His Holy Spirit, the One who regenerates man (Eph. 1:13). The Holy Spirit is God Himself entering into man to be the divine life and essence in man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">I. Freedom</h2>
<p>Once a person believes in the Lord and receives forgiveness of sins, he is freed from God&rsquo;s judgment and condemnation (John 3:18; 5:24), from the curse of the law (Gal. 3:13), from the wrath of God (Rom. 5:9; John 3:36; 1 Thes. 1:10), and from the fear and slavery of death (Heb. 2:14-15). Moreover, because he is begotten of God and has received the eternal life of God and the Holy Spirit of God, he is freed from sins (Matt. 1:21) and the power of sin (John 8:34, 36; Rom. 6:6) as well as from the law (Gal. 4:4-5; Rom. 7:6) and the bondage of the law (Gal. 5:1; 4:7). Furthermore, He is released from the flesh (Col. 2:11), the old man (Col. 3:9), Satan&rsquo;s oppression (Luke 4:18; Acts 10:38), the religious world and its ordinances (Gal. 1:4; 6:14-15; Col. 2:20), and his vain manner of life handed down from his fathers (1 Pet. 1:18). He is therefore completely set free (John 8:36) and is no longer under any kind of bondage or confinement.</p>
<h2 class="head2">J. Salvation</h2>
<p>Once a person believes in the Lord, he is saved (Eph. 2:8; Acts 16:31; Luke 7:50). Salvation includes God&rsquo;s calling, the Spirit&rsquo;s sanctification, the union between the Triune God and man, and the aforementioned items, namely, forgiveness of sins, washing, sanctification, justification, reconciliation to God, regeneration, eternal life, the Holy Spirit, and freedom. All the grace God has bestowed upon man is included in this salvation. Once man believes, he receives this full salvation with all its riches. After believing, he does not receive anything additional, but rather experiences continually what he has already received.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Immediately following the Spirit&rsquo;s sanctification and man&rsquo;s repentance is man&rsquo;s faith, or man&rsquo;s believing. To believe is to receive; it is also to &ldquo;believe into.&rdquo; The believers receive Christ into them that He may be mingled with them; on the other hand, they believe into Him that they may be joined to Him. Once a person believes, he receives Christ, who is the Word, the very God, and the light, into him. He also believes into His name, into the Son of God, and into the Son of Man, who died and was resurrected, to be joined to the Lord Himself and receive the eternal life. At the same time, his sins are taken away, his evil nature is dealt with, and Satan is destroyed within him. Moreover, once a person believes in the Lord Jesus, he immediately receives the blessings of forgiveness of sins, washing, sanctification, justification, reconciliation to God, regeneration, eternal life, the Holy Spirit, freedom, and salvation. Thus, through faith man receives all the grace with all the riches that God bestows upon man.</p>

</ol>
<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will continue to look at the various aspects of believing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE MEANS OF BELIEVING</h2>
<p>It is through the hearing of the word of the truth of the gospel (Eph. 1:13) that man believes in the gospel. Through the preaching of those who are sent by God, man can hear the word of the gospel and thus believe, call upon the Lord&rsquo;s name, and be saved. In Romans 10:14-15 Paul says, &ldquo;How then shall they call upon Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without one who preaches? And how shall they preach unless they are sent?&rdquo; Therefore, believing is produced through hearing the word of the truth of the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE ACT OF BELIEVING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Believing with the Heart</h2>
<p>In the act of believing, man first believes with his heart. If man believes with his heart that God has raised the Lord Jesus from among the dead, he is justified (Rom. 10:9-10). The Bible does not ask us to believe in the death of the Lord Jesus; it only tells us to believe in His resurrection. His death is acknowledged by all men, but no one can believe in His resurrection unless the Holy Spirit reveals it to him. Objectively, He died as our Substitute to accomplish redemption for our sins. Subjectively, He was resurrected to impart life to us that we may have a union with Him. Without the subjective union, the objective substitution has nothing to do with us. Therefore, we must both believe that God has raised the Lord Jesus from among the dead and be joined to Him. Only then can we obtain the objective substitution and be saved. Otherwise, our faith is vain; we are still in our sins (1 Cor. 15:14, 17). This is why in their preaching of the gospel the early apostles especially preached the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, bearing witness of it (Acts 1:22; 2:32; 3:15; 4:33).</p>
<p>In Romans 10:10 Paul says clearly that with the heart man believes unto righteousness. Therefore, when man believes with the heart that God has raised the Lord Jesus from among the dead, the result is righteousness. This means that the righteousness of God is counted as the righteousness of those who believe in the Lord Jesus.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Confessing with the Mouth</h2>
<p>In the act of believing, man also confesses with his mouth. If we confess with our mouth, &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; we will be saved (Rom. 10:9-10). To believe is not only to believe with our heart that God has raised the Lord Jesus from among the dead, but also to confess with our mouth, &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; before men. Hence, if we desire to be saved through faith, we need to confess the Lord Jesus and call upon His name. This will result in our salvation (Rom. 10:13). God created us as vessels fit for containing Him (Gen. 1:26-27; Rom. 9:23). As vessels we have an opening&mdash;our mouth. Hence, we should open our mouth wide that we may receive Christ (Psa. 81:10). In order to be saved we need to call upon the name of the Lord. When we call upon Him, we receive Christ as our salvation and participate in and enjoy His riches. Therefore, we have a heart with which we can believe that God has raised the Lord Jesus from among the dead, so that we may believe into Him and be joined to Him. Furthermore, we also have a mouth with which we can call upon the Lord Jesus so that we may receive Him and gain His salvation and His riches.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. FAITH BEING A GIFT GIVEN BY GOD</h2>
<p>Faith is not of man&rsquo;s works nor of man&rsquo;s endeavor or striving, but of God&rsquo;s gift (Eph. 2:8-9). Faith does not exist in us. It is when we repent and confess our sins before God in the name of the Lord Jesus that the believing ability is dispensed into us, enabling us to believe. Therefore, faith is our appreciation of what Christ is and of what He has accomplished for us. When Christ is infused into us through the preaching of the gospel, spontaneously we appreciate Him and call upon Him. This is the genuine faith, which is of Christ and in Christ (Gal. 2:20b). Hence, the Bible calls this faith the faith of Christ (Rom. 3:22) and the faith of the Son of God (Gal. 2:20). Moreover, such a faith which is given to us by God is the common faith of the believers (Titus 1:4; 2 Pet. 1:1).</p><h2 class="head2">A. Through the Divine Revelation</h2>
<p>Faith is a gift given to us by God through the divine revelation, which is the revelation of the Bible. The entire Bible is a revelation of Christ, conveying as its contents the all-inclusive Christ in His all-inclusive person and His all-inclusive work. When we read the Bible or hear a gospel preacher preaching this all-inclusive Christ according to the Bible, the Holy Spirit causes us to see the revelation of the all-inclusive person and work of Christ through the word of the Bible. That is, by showing us the divine scenery, He causes the knowledge and appreciation of Christ to be generated in us. Thus, Christ can infuse Himself into us to become the faith within us. It is by this means that faith is given to us by God as a gift.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Through the Operation of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>It is by the operation of the Holy Spirit that God causes us to believe in Christ through the revelation of the Bible. When we hear the word of the truth, the gospel of salvation, which is the divine revelation with the all-inclusive person and work of Christ as its contents, the Holy Spirit operates in us (Eph. 1:13), moving us to turn toward Christ, appreciate Christ, and believe in and receive Christ. Thus, He brings Christ into us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Through the Pneumatic Christ</h2>
<p>The Holy Spirit causes us to see the divine scenery through the divine revelation, thus bringing Christ into us. This pneumatic Christ becomes the believing element and ability in us, so that we can believe in Him spontaneously. Hence, He is the Author of our faith. Such a faith is the faith of Christ, and it is also the faith of the Son of God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Author of Faith</h2>
<p>As the Author of faith (Heb. 12:2), the Lord Jesus is the source, the cause, of our faith. According to our natural man, we do not have any believing ability. We do not have faith by ourselves. It is when we look unto Jesus that He, as the pneumatic Christ (1 Cor. 15:45b), transfuses us with Himself as the believing element. It is by this means that He originates the believing ability in us, enabling us to believe in Him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Faith of Christ</h2>
<p>Such a faith is called the faith of Christ (Gal. 2:16; Phil. 3:9) because it comes out of our knowledge and appreciation of Christ. When we appreciate Him, He infuses Himself into us to become the faith within us. This faith is also called the faith of the Son of God (Gal. 2:20) because Christ is the Son of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. FAITH BEING THE LIKE PRECIOUS PORTION<br />
ALLOTTED TO THE BELIEVERS BY GOD</h2>
<p>The faith we have through which we are saved is not of ourselves; it is the gift of God. We, the believers, have been allotted like precious faith by God&rsquo;s gift (2 Pet. 1:1). This faith is the substantiation of the substance of the truth (Heb. 11:1), which is the reality of the contents of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. The contents of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy are composed of &ldquo;all things which relate to life and godliness&rdquo; (2 Pet. 1:3), that is, the Triune God dispensing Himself into us as life within and godliness without. The like precious faith allotted to us by God causes us to respond to the reality of such contents and ushers us into the reality, substantiating the substance of the divine truth in us and making it subjective to us in our life and experience. Hence, such a faith allotted to the believers is the real inheritance and precious portion given to them by God in the New Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. FAITH BEING THE KEY TO RECEIVING<br />
GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h2>
<p>This precious faith within the believers, the God-given faith allotted to them through the Holy Spirit as the power and Christ as the element, is the key to receiving God&rsquo;s New Testament economy (1 Tim. 1:4). In contrast, the law, which was given by God outside of Israel through the angels and Moses (Gal. 3:19), was the key to the Old Testament dispensation. It was used to guard God&rsquo;s chosen people unto the faith which was about to be revealed. Furthermore, it was used as a child-conductor to lead them to Christ that they might be justified by faith (Gal. 3:23-26). In like manner, the precious faith given by God to the believers, which opens up all things relating to life and godliness, is the key to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Through faith the believers may partake of the divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4), enjoying all that God is. Moreover, they may enjoy the riches of the divine nature in its development to the fullest extent by the virtue of God unto His glory.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Believing comes through hearing the word of the truth of the gospel. Man&rsquo;s believing act consists of man&rsquo;s believing with his heart and his confessing with his mouth. With the heart man believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth man confesses unto salvation. This faith is of God&rsquo;s gift, not of man&rsquo;s works nor of man&rsquo;s endeavor or striving. It is the result of Christ&rsquo;s infusing Himself into us through the preaching of the gospel. God gives, this faith as a gift to us through His divine revelation and the operation of the Holy Spirit, bringing the pneumatic Christ into us to become our believing element and ability. Hence, Christ is the Author of our faith. Such a faith, which is called the faith of Christ and the faith of the Son of God, is the like precious portion allotted to the believers by God. It is also the key to receiving God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, for it opens all things which relate to the divine life and godliness in the New Testament. Therefore, through faith the believers may partake of the divine nature, enjoying all that God is. Moreover, they may enjoy the riches of the divine nature in its development to the fullest extent by the virtue of God unto His glory.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s salvation has many aspects, some of which we need to receive by believing, while others we need to partake of by being baptized. To believe is to exercise the inward faith to receive one aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation; to be baptized is to take an outward action to partake of another aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation. If we believe but are not baptized, we receive only one aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation and thus obtain only a partial salvation; we will not be able to partake of all the aspects of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation and thus enjoy the complete salvation. Hence, we must believe and be baptized (Mark 16:16) that we may partake of all the aspects of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation and receive the complete salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">1. THE IMPORTANCE OF BAPTISM</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being the Initiation<br />
of the New Testament Dispensation</h2>
<p>The first thing God did in the beginning of the New Testament dispensation was to send John the Baptist to preach the baptism of repentance (Acts 10:37; Luke 3:3). Hence, John was the first servant sent by God in the beginning of the New Testament, and the baptism of repentance which he preached is the initial teaching of the New Testament. This indicates the importance of baptism in God&rsquo;s New Testament plan and arrangement. We may say that baptism opens the New Testament dispensation. Just as the truth of baptism was God&rsquo;s initiation of the New Testament dispensation, so the practice of baptism marks the beginning of our enjoyment of the New Testament blessings.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Being the Fulfillment<br />
of Righteousness before God</h2>
<p>The importance of baptism is seen even more clearly in the need of the Lord Jesus to be baptized. Although He was the Son of God who came to be the Savior of mankind, because He became a man, He needed to keep God&rsquo;s ordination for man in the New Testament dispensation. As a man, it was fitting for Him to act according to God&rsquo;s procedure to fulfill all righteousness before God (Matt. 3:13-16). &ldquo;Righteousness&rdquo; is to be right by living, walking, and doing things in the way God has ordained. In the Old Testament, righteousness was a matter of keeping the law that God gave. Now, in the New Testament, God sent John the Baptist to baptize people. To be baptized was to fulfill righteousness before God, that is, to fulfill the requirement of God. Since it was fitting even for the Lord as a man to be baptized to fulfill such righteousness before God, we can see how important baptism is. Not only was He Himself baptized to fulfill all righteousness before God, but He also baptized people through His disciples (John 3:22; 4:2) that they might do God&rsquo;s will in compliance with God&rsquo;s procedure to fulfill righteousness before God. This also indicates the importance of baptism.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Refusing to Be Baptized<br />
Being the Nullification of the Counsel of God</h2>
<p>Baptism is the counsel of God in His New Testament economy; it is also a part of His plan. Anyone who would not be baptized nullifies God&rsquo;s counsel and God&rsquo;s plan for himself. In those days the Pharisees and the lawyers who rejected and opposed the Lord refused to be baptized with the baptism of John; hence, they rejected, nullified, the counsel of God for themselves (Luke 7:30). What a serious matter this is!</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Being the Lord&rsquo;s Charge before His Ascension</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus not only baptized people through His disciples when He was on the earth, but even after His resurrection, in His ultimate commission to His disciples to go to the whole earth to preach the gospel, He also charged them to baptize people (Matt. 28:19). This charge in His ultimate commission shows that to baptize people is an urgent matter which we must practice when we go to preach the gospel and disciple the nations. To baptize people is as important as to preach the gospel to them. Merely preaching the gospel to people without baptizing them is insufficient; it cannot completely carry out the Lord&rsquo;s ultimate commission.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Being the Apostles&rsquo; Teaching</h2>
<p>On the day of Pentecost, many heard Peter&rsquo;s word and were pierced in the heart, and they asked him what they should do. Peter told them affirmatively that they should repent and be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of their sins that they might receive the gift of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:37-38). When they heard his word, they were baptized. This also shows the importance of baptism, since Peter stressed it in his instruction. He considered baptism to be as important as repentance and believing in the Lord&rsquo;s name. Furthermore, as the conclusion of repentance and believing, baptism causes us to have our sins forgiven and to receive the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Baptism was practiced by the first group of believers who were added to the church after the Lord&rsquo;s ascension and the Spirit&rsquo;s descension. The first occurrence of any matter in the Scriptures becomes the standard for that matter. Based on this principle, the baptism of that first group of people was also a standard that should be kept by those after them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Being a Step for the Entrance<br />
into the Kingdom of God</h2>
<p>In John 3:5 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.&rdquo; &ldquo;Of water&rdquo; here refers to baptism. Baptism is a crucial and necessary step for man to be regenerated and enter into the kingdom of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE MEANING OF THE WORD BAPTISM</h2>
<p>In the New Testament, the verb form of the word baptism in Greek is <em>baptizo,</em> meaning to immerse or dip in water, to cover with water, or to put into water. This definition is generally found in all the well-known Greek lexicons and is commonly acknowledged by the reputable Bible scholars throughout the generations, Martin Luther said, &ldquo;I wish that whoever is to be baptized should be sunken entirely into the water, for this would be right according to the meaning of the word &lsquo;baptism.&rsquo;&rdquo; John Calvin, a great Bible expositor of the Reformation, also said, &ldquo;The word &lsquo;baptize&rsquo; means to immerse, and it is clear that the rite of immersion was observed in the ancient church.&rdquo; Therefore, there is no doubt that the meaning of the word baptism is immersion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF BAPTISM</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. To Be Baptized into the Name of the Father,<br />
the Son, and the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>To be baptized is to be baptized into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19), that is, to be baptized into the Triune God to have an organic union with the processed Triune God. The Lord Jesus passed through incarnation, human living, and an all-inclusive death in which He dealt with sin, abolished death, destroyed Satan, and removed all negative things. Then, He uplifted humanity, entered into resurrection, and became the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit. Following this, He came to His disciples in resurrection, charging them to baptize the repentant and believing ones into the name of the Triune God. The name denotes the person, and the person is the reality of the name. The name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit is not an empty name but the person, the reality, of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The preposition &ldquo;into&rdquo; indicates that the baptized one is brought into an organic union with the Triune God. Hence, baptism is not a ceremony for one to join the church, nor is it a religious ritual. Rather, through baptism a person who was outside of God is put into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, into the very Triune God Himself, that is, into the reality of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, that he may have an organic union with the Triune God.</p><h2 class="head2">B. To Be Baptized into<br />
the Name of the Lord Jesus</h2>
<p>To be baptized is also to be baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus (Acts 8:16; 19:5). In the Gospel of Matthew the Lord Jesus charged the disciples to baptize the believers into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. In the book of Acts, however, when the apostles went out to practice this, they baptized the believers into the name of the Lord Jesus. This indicates that to baptize people into the name of the Lord Jesus is to baptize them into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Because the Lord Jesus is the embodiment of the processed Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (Col. 2:9)&mdash;to baptize people into Him is to baptize them into the Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. To Be Baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ</h2>
<p>Acts 10:48 says, &ldquo;And he charged them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; To be in the name of Jesus Christ is to be in the person of Jesus Christ, to be in Jesus Christ Himself. To be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ is to be baptized in the sphere of the person of Jesus Christ. When we baptize anyone, we do it with Jesus Christ as the sphere and element. Apparently, water is the sphere and element of our baptism; in reality, water signifies a person, an all-inclusive person&mdash; Jesus Christ. It is in Him as the sphere and element that we baptize people.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. To Be Baptized upon the Name of Jesus Christ</h2>
<p>Acts 2:38 says, &ldquo;Repent and be baptized, each one of you, upon the name of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; To be baptized upon the name of Jesus Christ is to be baptized upon the ground of what the name of Jesus Christ stands for. It stands for all that the person of Jesus Christ is and all that He has accomplished, both of which constitute the faith (the contents) of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. The name of Jesus Christ is not only the sphere and element of baptism, but also the ground of baptism. It is on this ground, based upon this ground, that we baptize people. In other words, it is on the ground of the faith of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy that we baptize the believers.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. To Be Baptized into Christ</h2>
<p>Just as to believe is to believe into Christ, so also to be baptized is to be baptized into Christ (Gal. 3:27; Rom. 6:3b). Both bring us into Christ. By believing and being baptized we have entered and have been immersed into Christ, we have put on Christ, and we have been brought into an organic union with Him. Through our believing we have been joined to Christ to partake of Him. In like manner, through our baptism we have also been identified with Christ to have a share in Him. Hence, faith and baptism bring us into Christ to become persons who are in Christ.</p>
<p>Therefore, to baptize anyone into the name of the Lord Jesus is to baptize him into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, that is, to baptize him into Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. To Be Baptized into the Death of Christ</h2>
<p>Since to be baptized is to be baptized into Christ, it is also to be baptized into His death (Rom. 6:3b). Moreover, since we have been brought into an organic union with Christ through baptism, we have also been identified with His all-inclusive death, and we have been buried together with Him and raised together with Him (Rom. 6:4; Col. 2:12). In His all-inclusive death all negative things in the universe were terminated once for all, including sin, sins (1 Pet. 2:24; Heb. 9:26, 28), and the flesh (i.e., the body of sin&mdash;Rom. 6:6b); the ancient serpent, which is the Devil (Heb. 2:14), and the world belonging to him (John 12:31); the old man and the old creation (Rom. 6:6a); and all separating ordinances and customs among men (Eph. 2:14-15). Furthermore, on the positive side, Christ&rsquo;s divine life was released and imparted into us that we might become the many grains (John 12:24). In His burial we and our past were terminated, and in His resurrection we have received His life and have a new beginning in life. Hence, when we go into the water to be baptized, we walk into the death of Christ by faith, allowing ourselves and everything that belongs to and is related to us to be buried in the tomb of the water of baptism, in the burial of Christ. Then, by faith we walk out of the water, and in resurrection we allow the resurrected Christ to live in us that we may live by Him and with Him.</p>
<p>Therefore, through baptism we have been identified with Christ&rsquo;s death, burial, and resurrection. His death and burial, on the negative side, terminated us and everything that is of us, that we may be delivered from the self, sin, the world, and everything that is of the old creation, everything that is of Satan, and everything that is outside of God. His resurrection, on the positive side, has made us a new creation to partake of God&rsquo;s life and all its riches in Christ, and has brought us into a new realm of resurrection. In this new realm old things have passed away and have become new.</p><h2 class="head2">G. To Be Baptized into the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>We were not only baptized into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, into the name of the Lord Jesus, into Christ, and into the death of Christ; we were also baptized into the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:13), into one organic entity, with Christ as its life and constituent, to express Christ. All the believers in Christ, regardless of our races, nationalities, and social ranks, have been baptized in one Spirit into one Body. Christ is the life and constituent of this Body, and the Spirit is the reality of Christ. It is in this one living Body that we express Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. To Be Baptized in Water and in the Holy Spirit</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Water Being the Symbol of Baptism,<br />
and the Holy Spirit Being the Reality of Baptism</h2>
<p>Baptism has two aspects: the visible aspect is the baptism in water; the invisible aspect, the baptism in the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:5; 10:47; 9:17-18; John 3:5). Water is the symbol of baptism, and the Holy Spirit is the reality of baptism. The visible aspect is the expression, the testimony, of the invisible aspect, whereas the invisible aspect is the reality of the visible aspect. Without the invisible aspect by the Spirit, the visible aspect by the water is vain; and without the visible aspect by water, the invisible aspect by the Spirit is abstract and impractical, without an expression. Both are needed.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Typified by the Sea and the Cloud<br />
in Which the Children of Israel Were Baptized</h2>
<p>The water and the Holy Spirit in which we were baptized are typified by the sea and the cloud in which the children of Israel were baptized (1 Cor. 10:2). Their crossing of the Red Sea in the cloud and in the sea signifies that our baptism should be in the Holy Spirit and in water. Their passing through the Red Sea, on the negative side, delivered them from Pharaoh and Egypt, and on the positive side, brought them unto Moses. This signifies that, on the one hand, baptism delivers us from Satan and the world under him, and on the other hand, it brings us into Christ. Furthermore, Pharaoh and his army could only pursue them to the midst of the Red Sea, but not beyond it. Moreover, once the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea, they were delivered out of Egypt and could no longer go back to live the Egyptian life. This indicates that Satan and the power of his world can only pursue us to the midst of the water of baptism, but not beyond it. Furthermore, once we are baptized and have been delivered from the world, we can no longer go back to live a worldly life. The water of the Red Sea, on the one hand, destroyed Pharaoh and his army for the children of Israel, and on the other hand, it saved the children of Israel from Egypt that they might follow Moses to serve God. Similarly, on the one hand, the water of baptism destroys Satan and his worldly power for us, and on the other hand, it saves us from the world that we may follow Christ to serve God.</p>
<p>Although the children of Israel applied the blood of the lamb that God&rsquo;s smiting in His wrath might pass over them, it was not until they walked into the Red Sea that Pharaoh&rsquo;s power over them was destroyed. Although they had kept the Passover and were saved from God&rsquo;s judgment, they were not delivered from Pharaoh and Egypt&rsquo;s tyranny until they crossed the Red Sea. This indicates that although we have received the Lord&rsquo;s redemption through His shed blood and God&rsquo;s wrath has thus departed from us, it is not until we walk into the water of baptism that Satan and his worldly power can be destroyed. We have believed in the Lord and have thus been saved from God&rsquo;s judgment, but we must be baptized that we may be delivered from the usurpation of Satan and the world. Therefore, baptism delivers us from Satan and the world, just as the crossing of the Red Sea delivered the children of Israel from Pharaoh and Egypt. Just as Pharaoh and his army followed the children of Israel into the Red Sea and were drowned in it, so Satan and his worldly power were also brought into the water of our baptism and destroyed there. Although Pharaoh and his army were destroyed in the Red Sea, the children of Israel were able to come out of its midst and follow Moses to serve God. In like manner, although Satan and his worldly power were buried in the water of baptism, we were able to rise up from the water together with Christ that we may follow Him to serve God. Therefore, what the Red Sea did for the children of Israel, baptism does for us. It delivers us from the world and its power, and it brings us into another realm in resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head2">I. To Be Baptized by Water</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Water Being the Means of Salvation</h2>
<p>First Peter 3:20-21 says, &ldquo;...while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight souls, were brought safely through by water: which figure also now saves you, baptism,...through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.&rdquo; The words &ldquo;brought safely through by water&rdquo; here indicate that water was the means of salvation. In Noah&rsquo;s age, it was by the ark that God saved Noah and his family from His judgment, that is, the destruction of the world by the flood. But it was by the water as a separating power that God saved them from the corrupted generation and brought them into a new age. Thus, water is not only the symbol of baptism; it is also the means of salvation.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Typified by the Water<br />
through Which Noah and His Family Passed</h2>
<p>Under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, Peter told us that Noah&rsquo;s household of eight passing through the flood in the ark was a type of baptism. The waters of the flood separated those who were in the ark from the world in which they once were, that they might be delivered from that corrupted age. This signifies that the water of baptism separates those of us who are in Christ from the world in which we formerly lived, that we may be delivered from this crooked and perverted generation. Therefore, just as Noah and his family were saved through the flood and delivered from that corrupted generation, so we also are saved through the water of baptism and delivered from this crooked generation. On the one hand, they entered the ark by faith and were saved through the ark, thus escaping God&rsquo;s judgment by the flood. On the other hand, they passed through the flood in the ark and were saved through the flood; that is, they were saved out of the former world and were brought into a renewed world. Likewise, on the one hand, we have entered into Christ by faith and have been saved through Christ, thus escaping the judgment of God&rsquo;s wrath. On the other hand, we have been baptized into Christ and have been saved through the water of baptism; that is, we have been delivered from the old world and brought into a new realm in resurrection. Therefore, what the flood did for Noah&rsquo;s household of eight, baptism does for us. It saves us through water and delivers us from the world that we may enter into the new realm of resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head2">J. Baptism Being an Appeal to God</h2>
<p>Baptism is the appeal to God of the baptized ones for a good conscience unto God (1 Pet. 3:21). When we were baptized, we were baptized into Christ to be identified with His death, burial, and resurrection; hence, through baptism we were able to obtain a good conscience. Our conscience no longer condemns us, but rather we are full of peace and confidence that our sins have been forgiven, that all the problems we have with God have been solved, and that we have been baptized into the Triune God (Matt. 28:19) and organically united with Him through the resurrection of Christ, that is, by Christ in resurrection as the Spirit of life.</p>
<p>Baptism is the counterpart of our faith. We need not only to believe in all that Christ has accomplished, but also to be baptized to match our believing. Our baptism and our believing are two aspects of one thing, and the two are inseparable. Our believing is an inward reflection of Christ&rsquo;s accomplishments. This inward believing, however, needs an outward expression. This expression is baptism. Baptism complements our believing. We, the believers, can have a good conscience unto God through believing and baptism. With such a good conscience we can testify before God, the world, the angels, Satan, and all creation that we have been identified with Christ, that we have died and been raised together with Him, that we are in Him, that our sins have been forgiven by God, that we have been justified by God, and that we are unto God and belong to God forever.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Some aspects of God&rsquo;s salvation we need to receive by believing, while others we need to partake of by being baptized. Only by both believing and being baptized can we obtain God&rsquo;s complete salvation. Baptism is as important as repentance and believing. This is because baptism is the initiation of the New Testament dispensation, the fulfillment of righteousness before God, the Lord&rsquo;s charge before His ascension, the teaching of the apostles, and a step for the entrance into the kingdom of God. Moreover, if anyone refuses to be baptized, he nullifies the counsel of God. According to the revelation of the Scriptures, to be baptized is to be baptized into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, into the name of the Lord Jesus, into the name of Jesus Christ, upon the name of Jesus Christ, into Christ, into His death, and into His Body. Such baptism has two aspects: water baptism and Spirit baptism. Water, as the symbol of baptism, and the Holy Spirit, as the reality of baptism, are typified by the sea and the cloud in which the children of Israel were baptized. Water is also the means of salvation, as typified by the water through which Noah and his family passed. Such baptism is an appeal to God that we, the baptized ones, may have a good conscience before God and testify to the whole universe that we have been identified with Christ, that our sins have been forgiven by God, that we have been justified by God, and that we are unto God and belong to God forever.</p>

<h2 class="head1">IV. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />
BAPTISM AND SALVATION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Through Baptism Man Being Regenerated<br />
and Entering into the Kingdom of God</h2>
<p>John 3:5 says, &ldquo;Unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.&rdquo; This word clearly indicates that, to be regenerated and enter into the kingdom of God one must be born not only of the Spirit but also of water. Hence, baptism is a condition of regeneration and entrance into the kingdom of God. This, of course, refers not only to the outward form of baptism, but even more to the reality of baptism. Nevertheless, we must not consider the aspect of reality as altogether spiritual and neglect the practice. To be regenerated and enter into the kingdom of God we need not only to repent and believe that we may receive God&rsquo;s life through the Holy Spirit, but also to practice baptism that everything of ourselves may be terminated by the water of baptism.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Through Baptism Man Being Forgiven<br />
of His Sins and Receiving the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>Acts 2:38 says, &ldquo;Repent and be baptized, each one of you, upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This shows that through baptism, as the conclusion of our repentance and believing, we are forgiven of our sins and we receive the Holy Spirit. Hence, baptism, together with repentance and faith in the Lord&rsquo;s name, is a condition for us to be forgiven of our sins and to receive the Holy Spirit. If we desire to be forgiven and to receive the Holy Spirit, in addition to our repenting and believing in the Lord&rsquo;s name, we must also be baptized as the conclusion of our repentance and faith.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Through Baptism Man Being Put into Christ</h2>
<p>The Scriptures tell us clearly that as many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ (Gal. 3:27), have been put into His death (Rom. 6:3), and have been buried and raised together with Him (Col. 2:12). This shows how closely baptism is related to our salvation. Baptism is the procedure by which we are put into Christ, and it is the step by which we are put into His death and are buried and raised together with Him. Hence, baptism does not merely signify our co-death, co-burial, and co-resurrection with the Lord, as many Christians believe. Through baptism we are actually put into Christ; we are in reality put into His death and are buried and raised together with Him. This, of course, requires faith. The inward believing heart, however, needs to be matched by the outward action of baptism. To be put into Christ, to be put into His death, and to be buried and raised together with Him, we need both the inward faith and the outward baptism.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Through Baptism Man Being Saved</h2>
<p>In Mark 16:16 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.&rdquo; This indicates that man needs baptism as well as faith to obtain full salvation. Just as faith is a condition of salvation, so baptism is also a condition of salvation. This is why Peter said that baptism saves us (1 Pet. 3:21) from this generation, just as the ark through the judging water saved Noah and his family of eight from that generation.</p>
<p>Many people often change the Lord&rsquo;s word, &ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved,&rdquo; into &ldquo;He who believes and is saved shall be baptized.&rdquo; They consider that faith alone is the procedure for salvation and that it precedes salvation, whereas baptism is something that follows salvation. Actually, what the Lord means is that baptism and faith together are the procedure for salvation and both precede salvation. To be saved we need to take only one step, but it requires two feet. One foot is faith, and the other is baptism. These two together make one complete step to bring us into the Lord&rsquo;s full salvation.</p><h2 class="head1">V. THE PERSONS TO BE BAPTIZED</h2>
<p>Anyone who believes in the Lord Jesus is qualified to be baptized, because the Word says, &ldquo;He who believes and is baptized...&rdquo; (Mark 16:16). This is an unchangeable principle. One who does not believe or has not yet believed is not qualified to be baptized.</p>
<p>When those in Samaria believed Philip, bringing the good news concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women (Acts 8:12). They believed not only in the gospel but also in the name of the Lord. Because of their faith, they could be baptized and were all baptized.</p>
<p>When Philip preached the gospel to the eunuch from Ethiopia, he also said to him, &ldquo;If you believe with all your heart, you may [be baptized]&rdquo; (Acts 8:37). Hence, a person may be baptized as long as he believes with all his heart. It is not necessary to wait until he understands a great number of doctrines, nor is it necessary to require of him other things. We must take note, however, that this verse says that a person must believe with all his heart, not halfheartedly, that is, not half believing and half doubting. Only when a person believes with all his heart can he be baptized.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the early days many Corinthians also believed and were baptized (Acts 18:8). Their case also illustrates that faith, and faith alone, precedes baptism. Nothing less than faith is acceptable, and nothing more than faith is necessary.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. THE PERSONS WHO BAPTIZE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Disciples of the Lord</h2>
<p>When He was on earth, the Lord Jesus did not baptize people personally; He asked His disciples to do it (John 4:2). Although there were some apostles among the disciples, they did not baptize by their apostleship; rather, they baptized as disciples. This tells us that the Lord did not ask those who had official duties among the disciples to baptize people; rather He told the disciples, those who believed in Him, to baptize people. Therefore, a person is qualified to baptize as long as he is a believer in the Lord, a disciple of the Lord. The teaching that only those who have official duties in the church are qualified to baptize people is neither scriptural nor according to the Lord&rsquo;s will. It is not the Lord&rsquo;s intention that only those who have official duties in the church may baptize, nor is it that those who baptize do so in an official capacity; rather, it is that all the saved ones may baptize people in their capacity as believers.</p>
<p>Although the Lord chose Paul to be His apostle, He sent a disciple, not an apostle, to baptize him. The name of that disciple was Ananias (Acts 9:10, 17-18). The Bible does not tell us that he had any official position in the church; it only says that he was a disciple. This indicates that a person may baptize as long as he is a disciple; he does not need to be someone with official duties in the church. Of course, those who baptize must take the matter seriously and seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Those Who Have<br />
the Authority to Preach the Gospel<br />
Having the Authority to Baptize</h2>
<p>It was to the disciples, not the apostles, that the Lord gave the ultimate commission of preaching the gospel to all the nations and baptizing them (Matt. 28:16, 19). Eleven of those who received the commission were apostles, yet here in Matthew 28:16 they were not called the eleven apostles but the eleven disciples. The Lord commissioned them not as apostles, but as disciples. If the Lord had given them the commission because He considered them to be apostles, then it would mean that He required only a small number of apostles to preach the gospel to all the nations, and that He did not require all the disciples to do it. This was not the Lord&rsquo;s intention. The Lord intended that all His disciples who believed in Him would go to preach the gospel to people and baptize them. Anyone who was a disciple of the Lord should preach the gospel and baptize people. It was the mission of His disciples to preach the gospel, and it was also their obligation to baptize people. Baptizing and preaching were the two aspects of His charge to His disciples. His disciples had both the responsibility and the authority to carry out both aspects. Hence, whoever has the authority to preach the gospel has the authority to baptize.</p>
<p>Philip was not an apostle but an evangelist (Acts 21:8), yet he not only preached the gospel to the eunuch but also baptized him. This shows that anyone who has the authority to preach the gospel may baptize. Furthermore, Philip baptized the eunuch by himself along the road in a place where there was no church. This also proves that, in a place where there is no church, a believer may baptize people on his own after he has preached the gospel to them. Of course, in principle this is true, but in specific cases one must have the leading of the Holy Spirit to do this, as Philip did.</p>
<p>When Paul preached the gospel in Corinth, many were saved and baptized. He, however, baptized only a small number of them (1 Cor. 1:14-17). The rest of them were baptized by the other believers. This shows that those who baptize people do not necessarily have to be the sent apostles or those with official duties. Of course, the sent apostles and those with official duties may baptize people as Paul did, but in places where there are other brothers, it is best if they do as Paul also did by letting the brothers do more and doing less themselves.</p>
<p>Some, however, have taken 1 Corinthians 1:17 as their ground to merely preach the gospel without baptizing people. This thought is also inaccurate. Although the apostle said that he was not sent to baptize but to preach the gospel, he also baptized if necessary. However, in places where there were brothers, he would try to do less himself. The principle is that whoever preaches the gospel should baptize. It is best if there are brothers who can share in this together; otherwise, you must do it yourself.</p><h2 class="head1">VII. THE TIME OF BAPTISM</h2>
<p>Once a person has believed in the Lord, he must be baptized immediately and not wait one moment. On the day of Pentecost, when the three thousand received the gospel preached by Peter, they believed in the Lord and were baptized immediately (Acts 2:41). The Samaritans, having heard the gospel preached by Philip, also believed and were baptized (Acts 8:12). The eunuch from Ethiopia believed while on the road, and it was not convenient for him to be baptized, yet he did not hesitate but was baptized immediately after he believed (Acts 8:37-38).</p>
<p>The Philippian jailer and his household believed in the Lord at night and were baptized immediately the same night (Acts 16:33). They were Gentiles who had never known God or the word of the Lord, and when they believed it was already midnight. Yet Paul and Silas, still bearing stripes from being beaten with rods, without hesitation immediately baptized these people who had only heard the gospel once and had believed in the Lord.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the case of Saul, Ananias was sent by the Lord to Saul, saying, &ldquo;And now, why do you delay? Rise up and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on His name&rdquo; (Acts 22:16). Only three days had passed (Acts 9:9) since Paul had believed, yet the Holy Spirit blamed him for delaying his baptism. Today if someone is baptized after having believed for only three days, people may blame him for doing it too soon. However, in this matter we must follow the mind of the Holy Spirit, not our own concept. It is a delay to the Holy Spirit if someone is not baptized after having believed for three days, for the Lord&rsquo;s intention is that a person be baptized immediately after he has believed in the Lord, without waiting even a moment.</p>
<p>Therefore, concerning baptism, we must be recovered to the extent that the water of baptism always follows the preaching of the gospel. Once a person receives the gospel and believes in the Lord, immediately he goes into the water to be baptized. To practice this way is according to the Lord&rsquo;s mind; it is to follow the Bible&rsquo;s example, and it is spiritually profitable. However, it also requires faith and spiritual power. We need to preach the gospel with power and have the faith to baptize. Otherwise, we are merely imitating the letter of the Scriptures without spiritual reality.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VIII. THE PLACE OF BAPTISM</h2>
<p>There is no restriction concerning the place of baptism; any place with water is good for baptism. After the eunuch from Ethiopia believed the gospel, Philip baptized him along the road when they came to some water (Acts 8:36-38).</p>
<p>John 3:23 also says, &ldquo;And John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there; and they came and were baptized.&rdquo; Because there was much water in Aenon, John baptized there. This shows that a place that is right for baptism must have sufficient water. As long as a place has enough water for a person to be immersed, that is a suitable place to have a baptism.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IX. THE CORRECTION OF BAPTISM</h2>
<p>Acts 19:3-5 says, &ldquo;And he said, Into what then were you baptized? And they said, Into John&rsquo;s baptism. And Paul said, John baptized with a baptism of repentance, telling the people that they should believe in the One coming after him, that is, in Jesus. And when they heard this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.&rdquo; These verses tell us that there were about twelve disciples in Ephesus who were baptized with John&rsquo;s baptism of repentance. They were not aware of the fact that John&rsquo;s ministry was to lead men to believe in the Lord Jesus and that the baptism of repentance which he preached had passed away with him after the ministry of the Lord Jesus had begun, so that men must now be baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. Once they realized this matter, they immediately were corrected. In the early days this out-of-date baptism of repentance, which was inaccurate, needed to be corrected. Likewise, today there are also some improper practices of baptism, such as baptism by sprinkling, infant baptism, and baptism performed on those who have not yet properly believed in the Lord or who do not yet have a spiritual contact with Christ. These also need to be corrected. Of course, in making the correction, we also must exercise our faith to receive all the spiritual realities of baptism.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Baptism, as the conclusion of our repentance and faith, is closely related to our salvation. It is a condition for us to be regenerated and enter into the kingdom of God. Through baptism we are forgiven of our sins and receive the Holy Spirit, we are put into Christ, and we are saved. As long as we have believed in the Lord Jesus with all our heart, we are qualified to be baptized. Nothing less than faith is acceptable, and nothing more than faith is necessary. Furthermore, whoever has the authority to preach the gospel has the authority to baptize. Anyone who is a disciple may baptize. Concerning the time of baptism, once a person has believed in the Lord, he must be baptized immediately and not hesitate a minute. This example is clearly set forth in the Scriptures. All these points, of course, are given here as principles. In practice, we must have the leading of the Holy Spirit, and we also need faith and spiritual power. We must preach the gospel with power and baptize with faith. Concerning the place of baptism, there is no restriction except that there should be enough water for a person to be immersed. If a person&rsquo;s baptism was improper, it should be corrected.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In the initial stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, after we have believed and been baptized, we are joined to the processed Triune God. We have believed into the Triune God and have been baptized into the Triune God; therefore, we have advanced one complete step in God&rsquo;s salvation. Through this one complete step, faith and baptism, we are brought into the Triune God. Based on Matthew 28:19, we who have believed and have been baptized can boldly testify that we have been joined to the processed Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. JOINED TO GOD THE FATHER</h2>
<p>God the Father is the source of the divine Trinity. John 13:3 clearly reveals that the Son, Christ, came from the Father. Therefore, God the Father is His source. Furthermore, 1 Corinthians 6:19 reveals that the Holy Spirit also came from God, indicating that God the Father is also His source. God the Father, therefore, is the source of the divine Trinity. When the believers are joined to God the Father, they are joined to the source of the divine Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Turning to Him through Repentance</h2>
<p>To be joined to God the Father man must first turn to Him through repentance (Acts 2:38; 26:18). To repent is to have a change of mind. Originally man&rsquo;s mind was turned toward all the things other than God and was opposed to God. To be joined to God, man must first turn to Him from persons, affairs, and things other than God as well as from the authority of Satan. Unless man first turns to God, man has no way to be joined to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Being Baptized into Him</h2>
<p>To be joined to God the Father man must not only turn to Him through repentance but also be put into Him through baptism (Matt. 28:19b). Man can only be joined to God the Father by being baptized into Him. &ldquo;Baptized into&rdquo; indicates union. When we are baptized, we are baptized into God the Father. To baptize people into God the Father is to bring people into a spiritual, mysterious, and organic union with Him. We, therefore, who have turned to Him through repentance and have been baptized into Him have been joined to God the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Being Born of Him</h2>
<p>When we, the believers, repented and believed, we were born of God the Father to become the children of God (John 1:12-13; James 1:18; 1 John 3:1). Because we have been born of God the Father, we have the divine life and nature (John 3:15; 2 Pet. 1:4) and have been united with God the Father in life and nature. This is to be joined to God the Father. Hence, when we turn to Him through repentance, are baptized into Him, and are born of Him, we are joined to God the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. JOINED TO GOD THE SON</h2>
<p>The believers are joined not only to God the Father as the source of the divine Trinity but also to God the Son (Matt. 28:19b) as the embodiment of the processed Triune God. Colossians 2:9 says, &ldquo;For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&rdquo; Here the Godhead refers to the Triune God&mdash; the Father, Son, and Spirit. All the fullness of the Triune God dwells in Christ as One who has a human body. Before His incarnation, the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in Him as the eternal Word, but not bodily. Since He became incarnate, clothed with a human body, the fullness of the Godhead began to dwell in a bodily way. After His death and resurrection, all the fullness of the Godhead dwells even the more in His glorified body (Phil. 3:21) unto eternity. Hence, Christ is the embodiment of the processed Triune God; all that the divine Trinity is, has, and has accomplished dwells in this all-inclusive Christ. When the believers are joined to God the Son, Christ, they are joined to the embodiment of the processed Triune God.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Believers Having Him Shined<br />
into Their Hearts</h2>
<p>We, the believers, are joined to God the Son because God has first shined Him into our hearts (2 Cor. 4:6). When we heard the gospel, not only did we hear some preaching or teaching, but even more we received a divine illumination. This illumination enables us to know the gospel of the glory of Christ, which illuminates, radiates, and shines in our hearts so that we may know the gospel, receive Christ, and have an organic union with Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Believers Having Received Him</h2>
<p>When God shines Christ into our heart, He brings Christ into us that we may believe and receive Him as our life and everything (John 1:12; Col. 2:6a). Thus, Christ enters into us, His believers, to be joined to us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Believers Having Him Revealed in Them</h2>
<p>When we heard the gospel, believed, and received Christ, God then revealed His Son, Christ, in us (Gal. 1:16). God&rsquo;s revealing of His Son to us, the believers, is in us, not outwardly but inwardly; not by an outward vision but by an inward seeing. This is not an objective revelation but a subjective one, that we may know Him, receive Him as our life, and have an organic union with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Believers Having Been Baptized into Him</h2>
<p>The believers not only need to believe and receive Him; they also need to be baptized into Him (Gal. 3:27a; Rom. 6:3a). To believe is to believe into Christ, and to be baptized is to be baptized also into Christ. By both faith and baptism the believers have been brought into Christ and immersed into Him, having thus been deeply joined to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Believers Having Put Him On</h2>
<p>As many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ (Gal. 3:27b). To put on Christ is to clothe ourselves with Christ. On the one hand, when we were baptized, we were baptized into Christ. On the other hand, when we were baptized, we also put on Christ. When we were baptized into Christ, we were baptized into Him as the Spirit. When we were baptized into Christ, spontaneously we put on Christ and were joined to Him as one.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Believers Having Been Put in Him</h2>
<p>We are joined to Christ because God has put us in Him (1 Cor. 1:30), transferring us from Adam into Christ (2 Cor. 5:17). This was accomplished through Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion and resurrection (Gal. 2:20) and also through our faith and baptism (John 3:15; Gal. 3:26-28). &ldquo;In Christ&rdquo; indicates that the Triune God has passed through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to accomplish a complete and full salvation that He may bring His redeemed people into an organic union with Himself, thus causing them to share with Him the same life, nature, and daily walk.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. The Believers Having Been Identified with Him</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. In His Death</h2>
<p>Since the believers are persons who are in Christ, they have been identified with Him in His all-inclusive death (Rom. 6:3b, 6a; Gal. 2:20a; Col. 2:20a). In His all-inclusive death Christ has dealt with sin, sins, the flesh, the old man, the old creation, and all the ordinances and customs that cause separations among men. All that He has accomplished through His death on the cross has become the practical, subjective experience of the believers by their having been identified with Him in His death. Now the believers are growing together with Him in the likeness of His death.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. In His Burial</h2>
<p>The believers have been identified with Christ not only in His death but also in His burial (Rom. 6:4a; Col. 2:12a). In His burial Christ terminated our flesh, self, and everything belonging to the self. When we are identified with Him in His burial, we are delivered from our flesh, self, sin, and the world. Furthermore, we are delivered from everything of the old creation and of Satan as well as from everything outside of God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. In His Being Made Alive</h2>
<p>The believers not only have been identified with Him in His death and burial, to die and be buried together with Him, but they also have been made alive together with Him (Eph. 2:5; Col. 2:13b). God made the believers alive by imparting His eternal life, which is Christ Himself (Col. 3:4), into their dead spirit through His Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). Thus He enlivened them that they might be identified with Christ in spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. In His Resurrection</h2>
<p>We not only have been made alive together with Christ, but we also have been raised together with Him (Eph. 2:6a; Rom. 6:4b; Col. 2:12; 3:1a). To make us alive together with Christ is the initial step of God&rsquo;s salvation in life. Following this, God raised us up together with Christ from the position of death. His resurrection was the germination of the new creation, that we who have believed in Him might become the sons of God (1 Pet. 1:3a; Heb. 2:10). His resurrection is proof that He has overcome death, including Satan, Hades, and the grave (Acts 2:24, 31; Heb. 2:14; Rev. 1:18). Since we have been raised together with Him, we triumph in Him.</p><h2 class="head3">5. In His Ascension</h2>
<p>We were not only raised together with Christ but also seated together with Him in the heavenlies (Eph. 2:6b), in the highest place in the universe. This is the third step of God&rsquo;s salvation in life. God&rsquo;s salvation is to save us to a position that is far above all the enemies of God. This is the highest position into which we have been brought in Christ. Hence, we have been identified with Christ in His death, His burial, His being made alive, His resurrection, and His ascension.</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. The Believers Having Been Grafted into Him</h2>
<p>In Romans 11:17-24 Paul speaks about God having grafted us as branches from a wild olive tree into Christ as the cultivated olive tree. The believers have been grafted into Christ to be joined to Him. As a result of this grafting, the believers, as branches from the wild olive tree, and Christ, as the cultivated olive tree, grow together organically. Originally they were two trees, each having its own life; but now these trees have been grafted together, and these lives grow organically together and have one issue. The believers&rsquo; life is, therefore, a grafted life, a life in which two lives are grafted together to become one life, a life that is joined to Christ and grows organically with Him. Thus, by being grafted into the reality of Christ, the cultivated olive tree, the believers are joined to Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">I. The Believers Having Been Attached to Him<br />
as God&rsquo;s Anointed One</h2>
<p>God attaches the believers corporately unto Christ, the anointed One, to share together the anointing of Christ which He has received of God (2 Cor. 1:21; Heb. 1:9b). As God&rsquo;s appointed One, Christ was anointed by God to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose and eternal plan. God has anointed Christ with Himself as the consummated Spirit, and He has attached all the believers unto this anointed One that they may share with Him in this anointing for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s eternal plan.</p>
<h2 class="head2">J. The Believers Having Been Joined to Him<br />
as One Spirit</h2>
<p>The believers are joined to Christ intimately to become one spirit with Him (1 Cor. 6:17). This indicates that the believers are in Him, and He in them. The believers have been organically mingled with Him and have become one with Him in life. Christ, as the embodiment of the Triune God, has passed through all the processes to become the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). Now this pneumatic Christ has entered into the believers and is mingled with their regenerated spirit to become one spirit. Thus, the believers are intimately joined to Christ to become one spirit with Him, never to be separated from Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">K. The Believers Exulting in Him</h2>
<p>The issue of the believers&rsquo; believing into Christ and being joined to Him is their exulting in Him (1 Pet. 1:8). Although they have not seen Him, they love Him; and in the proving of their faith they are able to exult in Him with unspeakable and glorified joy. This glorified joy is joy immersed in glory; hence, it is full of glory, that is, full of the Lord expressed. This is the manifest result of the believers&rsquo; being joined to Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>After we have believed and been baptized, we are joined to the processed Triune God. God the Father is the source of the divine Trinity, God the Son is the embodiment of the processed Triune God, and God the Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God. We, the believers, are joined to God the Father by turning to Him through repentance, by being baptized into Him, and by being born of Him to possess His divine life and nature; thus, we have an organic union with Him. We are joined to God the Son, Christ, by God the Father&rsquo;s shining Him into our hearts, by our receiving Him, and by God&rsquo;s revealing Him in us; thus, we are brought into an organic union with Him. Furthermore, through baptism we have been put into Him and have put Him on; we have been transferred by God into Him to be identified with Him in His death, His burial, His being made alive, His resurrection, and His ascension. We also have been grafted into Him, the cultivated olive tree, to grow together with Him organically; attached corporately unto Him, the anointed One, to share together the anointing which He has received of God; and intimately joined to Him to become one spirit, never to be separated from Him. As a result, we exult in Him with unspeakable and glorified joy that He may be expressed through us.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we shall continue to see the joining of the believers to the processed Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. JOINED TO GOD THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>God the Father is the source of the divine Trinity, God the Son is the embodiment of the processed Triune God, and God the Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God. The Spirit, in whom the complete divine Trinity is consummated, is the processed, compound, all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling, sevenfold intensified, consummated Spirit. Having received Him essentially and having been baptized into Him economically, the believers are organically joined to God the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Believers Having Received Him Essentially</h2>
<p>To receive God the Spirit essentially is to receive Him for our existence, being, life, and living. On the night of His resurrection the Lord Jesus came back to His disciples and breathed into them that they might receive the Holy Spirit essentially (John 20:22) as the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2), the life-giving Spirit whom He had become in resurrection, to be their life and the essence of the new creation (1 John 5:12; 2 Cor. 5:17). Having heard the gospel and having believed in the crucified Christ, the believers have received this all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit. This Spirit enters into them and lives in them to be the essence of their divine life, nature, and being.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. As the Spirit of Reality</h2>
<p>John 14:16-17 says, &ldquo;And I [the Son] will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever; even the Spirit of reality...He abides with you and shall be in you.&rdquo; It is pointed out here that the Spirit will come to indwell the believers, be joined to them, and be with them forever. The Spirit in the believers is the Spirit of reality who causes the reality of the divine Trinity and of all the divine things to be realized in them.</p>
<p>All that the Father is and has is the Son&rsquo;s (John 16:15; Col. 2:9), and all that the Son is and has is received by the Spirit (John 16:14). Hence, the entire Triune God&mdash;the Father, Son, and Spirit&mdash;is realized in this Spirit. When this Spirit enters into the believers, the Triune God is realized in them and mingled with them to become their life and their essence. This Spirit of reality is the reality of all the divine things, such as life, light, love, grace, and power. It is through Him that these divine things may be realized in the believers to be their experience and enjoyment. Hence, John 16:13 says, &ldquo;But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality.&rdquo; When the Spirit of reality enters into the believers to be joined to them, He will guide them into the reality of the divine Trinity and of the divine things.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. As the Spirit of Life</h2>
<p>The Spirit is also the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). Life is the intrinsic essence of the divine Trinity. When the Spirit enters into the believers, He imparts the eternal life of God into them to be their life. The word life is used four times in Romans 8:1-11. Verse 2 mentions the Spirit of life; verse 6 says that the mind set on the spirit is life; verse 10 says that our spirit is life because of righteousness; and verse 11 says that the indwelling Spirit will give life to our mortal bodies. This unveils a fourfold life. First, life is the Spirit. Then the Spirit comes into the believers&rsquo; spirit to make their spirit life. Furthermore, the Spirit spreads from their spirit into their mind to make their mind life. Finally, the Spirit imparts this life even into their mortal bodies to make the body of sin a body of life. The focus of this fourfold life is the indwelling of the Spirit of life in the believers&rsquo; spirit. This Spirit of life will spread from their spirit into their mind and throughout their whole soul, even reaching their body. Eventually, their whole being will be filled with the Spirit of life, that is, filled with the Triune God.</p><h2 class="head3">3. As the Anointing Ointment</h2>
<p>The Spirit is also the anointing ointment in the believers to anoint them (2 Cor. 1:21; Heb. 1:9b; 1 John 2:20, 27). The Spirit is not dormant in the believers; rather, He is always in motion and active. His moving, His action, is a kind of anointing to add more of the elements of the Triune God into them. The more this anointing ointment anoints them, the more the divine elements increase in them and the more the Triune God is united with them. The Spirit&rsquo;s adding the divine elements into them by anointing them is like someone&rsquo;s painting a piece of furniture. If he continues to paint, eventually that piece of furniture will be completely saturated with the paint, and the entire piece of furniture will bear the color of the paint.</p>
<p>It is also in this way that the Spirit&rsquo;s anointing causes the Triune God to be mingled with the believers. The Triune God Himself is both the Painter and the paint; the believers are like pieces of furniture. It pleases God to be mingled with them that they may be filled with His elements. Therefore, He has become the Spirit to be the anointing ointment continually anointing them until they are filled with His elements. When paint is applied to furniture, there is no interaction between the two. However, when the Spirit as the anointing is added into the believers, He is mingled with them as one.</p>
<p>The compound Spirit as the anointing is typified by the holy anointing ointment in Exodus 30. The holy anointing ointment was made by mingling four spices with a hin of olive oil. This blending made the oil into a fragrant ointment. Olive oil signifies the Spirit of God. Flowing myrrh smells sweet but tastes bitter, and in the Bible it is used mostly for burial. Hence, it signifies the precious death of Christ. Cinnamon has a distinctive flavor and is used as a spice in cooking. Thus, fragrant cinnamon signifies the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death. Calamus is a reed which grows out of a marsh or muddy place and shoots high into the air. Hence, calamus signifies the precious resurrection of Christ. Cassia was used in ancient times as a repellent to drive away insects and snakes. Cassia thus signifies the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. These four spices compounded with a hin of olive oil became the holy anointing ointment.</p>
<p>In the compounded ointment there were a hin of olive oil and four spices. In the Bible the number one signifies the unique God, and the number four signifies the creatures. Hence, the holy anointing ointment signifies the mingling of divinity with humanity. The first and the fourth of the spices were each of five hundred shekels. Five hundred signifies full responsibility. The second and third of the spices were each of two hundred fifty shekels. Hence, with the four spices there were three complete units of five hundred shekels. These three complete units signify the Triune God, and the middle unit divided in half signifies that the Second of the Godhead was split through death. The entire picture signifies that the Triune God has passed through death and that in resurrection He is mingled with humanity to bear the full responsibility.</p>
<p>Today the Spirit, who is typified by the holy anointing ointment, is the Triune God processed to become the all-inclusive compound Spirit. In this Spirit we can see divinity, humanity, the death of Christ, the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death, the resurrection of Christ, and the power of His resurrection. Now this all-inclusive compound Spirit is anointing us with all His riches as the ointment.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. As a Seal</h2>
<p>The Spirit is also the seal in the believers (2 Cor. 1:22a; Eph. 1:13; 4:30). A seal is a mark. The believers&rsquo; being sealed with the Spirit means that God has put the Spirit into them as a seal to mark them out, indicating that they are God&rsquo;s possession. Furthermore, a seal has an image. When the believers are sealed with the Spirit, they bear the image of God. Therefore, they are like God and they express God. The Spirit as the seal comes into the believers once for all, but the sealing of the Spirit is a continuing process. The believers have been sealed with the Spirit unto the redemption of God&rsquo;s acquired possession (Eph. 1:14), that is, the redemption, the transfiguration, of the believers&rsquo; body. The Spirit&rsquo;s sealing is His continual moving within the believers. It begins in their spirit and it spreads into their mind, emotion, and will. Eventually even their body will be sealed, saturated, with the Spirit. Thus their entire being will be sealed with the Spirit and completely joined to the Spirit as one.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. As the Pledge</h2>
<p>The Spirit is also the pledge in the believers (2 Cor. 1:22b; 5:5b; Eph. 1:14). In God&rsquo;s economy the believers are an inheritance to God, and God is an inheritance to them. For the believers to be God&rsquo;s inheritance, they need the sealing of the Spirit. Moreover, because God is their inheritance, they also need the pledging of the Spirit. The Greek word for pledge also means foretaste, guarantee, token payment guaranteeing the full payment, a part payment in advance. The Spirit as the pledge of the believers&rsquo; inheritance is not only a guarantee, guaranteeing that God and all that belongs to God are their eternal portion, their inheritance, but He is also a foretaste of what they will inherit of God. In ancient times, the Greek word for pledge was used in the purchase of land. The seller gave the buyer a sample of the soil from the land being purchased. This indicates that the Spirit is the sample of what we shall inherit of God.</p>
<p>The Spirit as the anointing in the believers imparts God&rsquo;s elements into them; as the sealing He forms the divine elements into an impression that the believers may express God&rsquo;s image; and as the pledging He gives them a foretaste as a sample and guarantee of the full taste of God. These three matters&mdash;the anointing, the sealing, and the pledging&mdash;are actually three aspects of one thing. First the believers are anointed, then they are sealed, and then they have the pledge as a guarantee. Hence, they can be completely mingled with the Triune God and be one with Him.</p><h2 class="head3">6. As the Firstfruit</h2>
<p>The Spirit is also the firstfruit (Rom. 8:23) in the believers that they may have a foretaste of all that the processed Triune God is. Foretaste indicates two things: first, that the enjoyment is fresh; and second, that there will be a fuller enjoyment in the future. Today the believers&rsquo; experience and enjoyment of the Spirit, regardless of its measure, is but a foretaste. At the Lord&rsquo;s coming they will enjoy the Triune God in full; that will be the harvest. Today the believers&rsquo; enjoyment of the foretaste may differ in measure, yet the nature is the same. By having a foretaste of the Spirit as the firstfruit, the believers can participate in and enjoy the processed Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">7. As the Blessing of God&rsquo;s Promise</h2>
<p>The Spirit is the blessing promised by God to Abraham for all the nations of the earth (Gal. 3:14), to be experienced and enjoyed by the believers as the foregoing items. The Spirit actually is God Himself processed in His Trinity through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection for the believers to receive as their life and their everything. This is the focus of the blessing of God&rsquo;s promise. The physical aspect of the blessing God promised to Abraham was the good land (Gen. 12:7; 13:15; 17:8; 26:3-4), which was a type of the all-inclusive Christ, whereas the spiritual aspect is the Spirit. Since Christ is eventually realized as the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17), the blessing of the promised Spirit corresponds to the blessing of the promised land. Hence, the Spirit, whom the believers have received, is the fulfillment of the promise of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy and the sum total of God&rsquo;s promised blessing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Believers Having Been Baptized<br />
into Him Economically</h2>
<p>The believers&rsquo; being joined to God the Spirit is of two aspects. On the one hand, they have received Him inwardly and essentially; on the other hand, they have been baptized into Him outwardly and economically. For the believers to be baptized into Him economically is for them to be baptized in the Holy Spirit (Mark 1:8b; Acts 1:5b; 11:16b) to receive Him as the Spirit of power for their spiritual work and function. The Holy Spirit as the Spirit of power was poured out economically first on the day of Pentecost to baptize the Jewish believers in the Spirit (Acts 2:4), and then in the house of Cornelius to baptize the Gentile believers in the Spirit (Acts 10:44-45). By these two steps all the believers of the Lord Jesus, in all times and in all places, have been baptized once for all in the Spirit and into one Body (1 Cor. 12:13). This matter has been accomplished once for all; it is an accomplished fact.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. As the Spirit of Power</h2>
<p>The believers have been baptized into the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of power (Acts 1:8a; Luke 24:49b). The Holy Spirit is not only in them as the Spirit of life essentially, but also upon them as the Spirit of power economically. They have the Spirit of life in them that they may have the Lord&rsquo;s life with its supply and sustenance; they also have the Spirit of power upon them that they may testify of the Lord and preach Him as the gospel. Therefore, the believers not &lsquo;only need to be joined to God the Spirit essentially as the Spirit of life, but they also need to be joined to Him economically as the Spirit of power.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Poured Out on Them</h2>
<p>The believers&rsquo; being baptized into the Holy Spirit economically and receiving Him as the Spirit of power is their having the Holy Spirit poured upon them (Acts 2:18, 33b; 10:45). God has poured out the Holy Spirit upon men outwardly. This matter is mentioned only twice in the New Testament, in Acts 2 and in Acts 10. In Acts 2 the Holy Spirit was poured out upon the Jewish believers on the day of Pentecost; in Acts 10 He was poured out upon the Gentile believers in the house of Cornelius. This was Christ&rsquo;s baptizing the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers into the Holy Spirit. Hence, it is an accomplished fact that the Holy Spirit has been poured out upon the believers, that is, that the believers have been baptized in the Holy Spirit. Now, by faith the believers may apply and experience the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and be joined to Him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Falling upon Them</h2>
<p>The believers&rsquo; receiving the Holy Spirit economically is their having the Holy Spirit fall upon them (Acts 1:8a; 8:16-17; 19:6a). Concerning this matter, Acts presents five cases. Two of them are for the accomplishment of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. These are the cases which took place on the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius. The other three, the cases of the Samaritan believers, Saul of Tarsus, and the twelve believers in Ephesus, are considered extraordinary, needing some members of the Body of Christ to identify them with the Body by the laying on of hands. Besides these five cases, in many cases of conversion, such as the three thousand and the five thousand, there is no mention of the believers&rsquo; receiving the Holy Spirit economically&mdash;the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s falling upon them&mdash;because in all these cases the believers were brought into the Body of Christ through their believing in a normal way. Hence, they all should have received the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s falling upon them economically in a normal way through their believing into Christ that they might be joined to the Holy Spirit as one.</p><h2 class="head3">4. To Clothe Them</h2>
<p>The Holy Spirit&rsquo;s being poured out upon the believers, His falling upon them, is to clothe them (Luke 24:49), to be joined to them. Concerning the Spirit of life, we need to breathe Him in as the breath; concerning the Spirit of power, we need to put Him on as the uniform that we may have the authority to carry out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>The foregoing points show us clearly that the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s coming to us is of two aspects: the inward aspect and the outward aspect; the essential aspect and the economical aspect; the aspect of life and the aspect of power. Hence, our experience of being joined to the Holy Spirit is also of two aspects: the inward and the outward. We must not stress the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s inward aspect of life while neglecting the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s outward aspect of power. Neither should we respect the outward Holy Spirit of power while ignoring the inward Holy Spirit of life. We must attach equal importance to both the essential aspect and the economical aspect; we must stress both the inward aspect and the outward aspect; we must have both the Spirit of life and the Spirit of power. The believers should maintain such a normal condition.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The believers are joined to God the Spirit by receiving Him essentially and being baptized into Him economically. On the one hand, when the believers receive Him essentially, they receive Him into them that He may live in them for their existence, being, life, and living. He is in them as the Spirit of reality that they may have the reality of the divine Trinity and of the divine things realized in them: as the Spirit of life continually imparting into them God&rsquo;s eternal life until their whole being is filled with the Spirit of life; as the anointing ointment, typified by the holy anointing ointment in the Old Testament, anointing all the riches of the processed Triune God into them that they may be filled with His elements; as a seal to mark them out as God&rsquo;s possession and to impress them with the image of God that they may be like God and may express Him; as the pledge, the foretaste, guarantee, and sample, to guarantee that God and all that belongs to God are their eternal portion; as the firstfruit for them to have a fresh foretaste of all that the processed Triune God is and for them to expect a fuller enjoyment in the future; and as the blessing of God&rsquo;s promise, which is the fulfillment of the promise of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. On the other hand, when the believers are baptized into Him economically, they are baptized in the Holy Spirit for their spiritual work and function. As the outward Spirit of power He has been poured out upon them, falling upon them, to clothe them that they may testify of Christ and preach the gospel to carry out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>Beginning from this lesson we shall cover the different aspects of our redemption.</p>
<p>Redemption means to repurchase what once belonged to you but was lost. Man once belonged to God and was His possession. However, man became fallen and was lost, sinking in sins and in many things that were contrary to God&rsquo;s righteousness, holiness, and glory, thus falling under the threefold demand of God&rsquo;s righteousness, holiness, and glory. Since man was unable to pay the price, God paid it for man through Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross, which accomplished an eternal redemption for man (Gal. 3:13; 1 Pet. 2:24; 3:18; 2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 10:12; 9:28). Since the blood of Christ has accomplished an eternal redemption for man (Heb. 9:12, 14; 1 Pet. 1:18-19), it is used by God as a great price to recover man, that all who believe in Christ may be redeemed, that is, forgiven, freed, washed, sanctified, justified, and reconciled to God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. FORGIVENESS OF SINS</h2>
<p>Forgiveness of sins is the first part of God&rsquo;s redemption, and it is received by us immediately upon our believing (Acts 10:43; 26:18). Our first problem before God is that there is a charge against us because of our sins. Only when this charge is resolved can the righteousness of God let us go. Unless our sins before Him are removed, the righteous God cannot grant us the other parts of His redemption. We therefore first need to have God&rsquo;s forgiveness of our sins.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Meaning of Forgiveness of Sins</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Delivering the Forgiven Ones<br />
from the Penalty of God&rsquo;s Righteousness</h2>
<p>First, forgiveness of sins means the removal of the charges of sin against us before God that we may be delivered from the penalty of God&rsquo;s righteousness (John 3:18; 5:24). Because a charge had been made against us before God so that we were condemned by God, it was necessary for us to suffer God&rsquo;s righteous punishment. But when God forgave us, He delivered us from the penalty of His righteousness and condemned us no longer. This is because the Lord Jesus shed His blood and died on the cross according to God&rsquo;s righteousness to suffer God&rsquo;s righteous punishment in our place (Heb. 9:22), thus satisfying God&rsquo;s righteous requirement. Hence, according to His righteousness, God can, and will, forgive the sins of those who believe in Christ, canceling the charges of sin against them and delivering them from the penalty.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Causing the Sins to Leave the Forgiven Ones</h2>
<p>In the New Testament the Greek word for forgiveness means &ldquo;causing (it) to leave&rdquo; and &ldquo;sending away&rdquo; (Matt. 12:31; Rom. 4:7; Acts 5:31; 13:38). When God forgives us of our sins, He not only cancels the charges of sin against us before Him and delivers us from the penalty of His righteousness, but also causes the sins which we have committed to depart from us. This is because when He made the Lord Jesus an offering for sin on the cross, He laid all our sins on Him that He might carry them up in His body for us (John 1:29; Isa. 53:6; 1 Pet. 2:24). Furthermore, when God caused the Lord Jesus to carry up our sins on the cross to suffer God&rsquo;s judgment and punishment in our place, He also caused all our sins to be laid on Satan that he should bear them forever. This is revealed in type in the atonement recorded in Leviticus 16. When the high priest made atonement for the children of Israel, he took two goats and presented them before God. One was for God and was to be killed to make atonement for the children of Israel; whereas the other was &ldquo;for Azazel,&rdquo; that is, for Satan, to bear the sins of the children of Israel (Lev. 16:7-10, 15-22 ASV). Because Azazel is in contrast to Jehovah, it is a type of Satan who is in opposition to God.</p>
<p>Sin came from Satan. Having been deceived by Satan, man allowed sin to come upon him, resulting in a charge being brought against him before God. God put all our sins on the Lord Jesus that He might bear them all to suffer God&rsquo;s punishment for us and cancel the charge against us before Him. Then He gave all our sins back to Satan that he might carry them himself. Thus, God can forgive us of our sins and cause our sins to leave us (Psa. 103:12).</p>
<p>Therefore, on the one hand, God forgives us of our sins because the Lord&rsquo;s blood has removed the charges of sin against us before Him; on the other hand, through the Lord&rsquo;s offering of Himself as the sin offering, He causes our sins to depart from us forever.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Forgetting the Sins of the Forgiven Ones</h2>
<p>When God forgives us of our sins, He also forgets our sins (Heb. 8:12). When God forgives us, He not only exempts us from suffering the penalty of sin and causes our sins to depart from us, but He also forgets our sins. Once He forgives us, He erases our sins from His memory and remembers them no longer.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Position and Authority to Forgive Sins</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. God</h2>
<p>Luke 5:21 says, &ldquo;Who can forgive sins but God alone?&rdquo; Hence, God alone has the position and authority to forgive, because He alone has the position and authority to condemn. Besides Him, no one has such position and authority. Man is not the Lord of the universe; furthermore, man is sinful. God alone is the Lord of the universe, and He alone is sinless. Hence, only God is able to condemn, and only God is able to forgive.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Son of Man (the Lord Jesus)</h2>
<p>Luke 5:24 says, &ldquo;The Son of Man has authority on the earth to forgive sins.&rdquo; Although the Lord Jesus is a man, He is also the very God who came to the earth to become a man. He is a man and He is also God; He is a God-man. He is a perfect man, and He is sinless (Heb. 4:15). He is also the complete God and the Lord of the universe. Therefore, like God, He has the position and authority to forgive sins.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Basis for Forgiveness of Sins</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s forgiveness is based on the shedding of blood (Heb. 9:22). Because He is righteous, God cannot forgive sins without a basis. His righteousness requires that all who sin must die (Ezek. 18:4). Unless His righteous requirement is satisfied, His righteousness cannot allow Him to forgive sinners of their sins. But since the Lord Jesus has died and shed His blood on the cross for men, thus satisfying God&rsquo;s righteous requirement, God can legally forgive men of their sins (Matt. 26:28).</p>
<p>Since the blood of the Lord Jesus was shed in His death for men according to God&rsquo;s righteousness as the price to satisfy God&rsquo;s righteous requirement, it has become the basis upon which the sins of those who believe in Him may be forgiven. Besides His blood, nothing else&mdash;neither man&rsquo;s good works and virtues nor man&rsquo;s zeal and love&mdash;can be the basis for the forgiveness of sins. This is because in the universe only His blood can satisfy all the righteous requirements of God on sinners.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Way for Sinners to Receive<br />
Forgiveness of Sins</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Repentance</h2>
<p>To receive forgiveness of sins from God, a sinner must repent (Luke 24:47; Acts 5:31; Isa. 55:6-7), turning back to God in his mind. Formerly he had his back toward God; thus, he sinned against God. Now, if he desires God&rsquo;s forgiveness, he must turn back to God, forsaking his own way and abandoning his own thoughts, thus turning to God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Faith</h2>
<p>To receive forgiveness of sins from God a sinner must not only repent but also believe (Acts 10:43; 26:18). On the negative side, to repent is to turn to God from the position of being against God; on the positive side, to believe is to receive from God His forgiveness. Neither repentance nor faith is a merit by which a sinner may receive forgiveness from God. A sinner can be forgiven by God only on the merit of the blood of the Lord Jesus. It is only because of the Lord&rsquo;s blood that God can grant the grace of forgiveness of sins to sinners. However, sinners can receive the grace of forgiveness of sins from God only through their repentance and faith.</p>
<p>Because the blood which the Lord Jesus shed on the cross has satisfied all God&rsquo;s righteous requirements on sinners, God can bestow upon them the grace of forgiveness of sins. However, a sinner still cannot be forgiven unless he repents and believes. He can receive God&rsquo;s forgiveness only through repentance and faith. The Lord Jesus has accomplished on the cross all the work that enables God to forgive sinners and all the work that enables sinners to receive forgiveness from God. For a sinner to receive God&rsquo;s forgiveness, it is not required of him to do anything other than to repent and turn to God and to exercise his faith to receive it from God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Limits of Forgiveness of Sins</h2>
<p>Matthew 12:31 says, &ldquo;Every sin...shall be forgiven men.&rdquo; Hence, no matter how broad or how great the limits of our sins are, the limits of God&rsquo;s forgiveness are just as broad and great. God&rsquo;s forgiveness is sufficient. It is sufficient to encompass all our sins and to solve all our problem of sins. On the cross the Lord Jesus made redemption for every sin. Hence, based upon the Lord&rsquo;s redemption, God can forgive every sin.</p>
<p>God and everything of Him is complete. Therefore, His forgiveness is complete. Since God never does anything incompletely, He cannot give us an incomplete forgiveness or a partial forgiveness, forgiving us of some of our sins and not forgiving us of other sins. Once He forgives us. He forgives us of all sins and all offenses (Col. 2:13).</p><h2 class="head2">F. The Results of Forgiveness of Sins</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Fear of God</h2>
<p>People think that God&rsquo;s forgiveness will cause man to become audacious and reckless. Little do they know that the grace of God&rsquo;s forgiveness is to bring man into the fear of God (Psa. 130:4). Our experience tells us that the more we are forgiven by God, the more we fear Him; the more we have received the grace of God&rsquo;s forgiveness, the more we have the fear toward God. Only those who have never been forgiven by God and who have never tasted the grace of God&rsquo;s forgiveness can behave in an audacious and reckless manner, doing whatever they please. Once we have tasted the grace of God&rsquo;s forgiveness, we immediately have a fearful heart and we also hate sin.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Love of God</h2>
<p>The grace of God&rsquo;s forgiveness causes us not only to fear God but also to love God. On the negative side, because we fear Him, we refrain from doing things that are displeasing to God; on the positive side, because we love Him, we do things that are pleasing to Him. The grace of God&rsquo;s forgiveness, therefore, causes us not only to fear God and refrain from sinning, but even more to love God and be pleasing to Him. In Luke 7, the sinful woman, having been forgiven by the Lord, not only ceased from her sinful living but also poured out all she had and all she was on the Lord to express her love toward Him. The law, which condemns us, cannot free us from sin, but grace, which forgives us, can. The condemnation at Mount Sinai could cause man only to be afraid of God and go far away from Him, but the forgiveness at the mount of Golgotha causes man to love God and draw near to Him. The more we have been forgiven by God, the more we love God. The reason that sinful woman loved the Lord much was that she was forgiven much by the Lord. Therefore, God&rsquo;s forgiveness of man results in man&rsquo;s fearing Him and loving Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. Forgiveness of Sins Being a Gift Given<br />
by the Exalted Christ</h2>
<p>Forgiveness of sins is a gift given to man after Christ was exalted to the right hand of God. After Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection, He was exalted by God to His right hand as a ruling Leader and a Savior, to give the grace of forgiveness of sins to man (Acts 5:31). Based upon His redemption (Eph. 1:7) and through man&rsquo;s repentance and believing, He can give man the forgiveness of sins as a gift.</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. Forgiveness of Sins<br />
Being a Main Item of the Proclamation<br />
of God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy</h2>
<p>After His death and resurrection, the Lord Jesus charged His disciples to proclaim in His name the gospel of repentance for forgiveness of sins to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem (Luke 24:47). After the Lord Jesus&rsquo; vicarious death for the sinners&rsquo; sins had been accomplished and had been verified by His resurrection, and after the Holy Spirit had been poured out upon the disciples, they began to proclaim the gospel of repentance for forgiveness of sins. On the day of Pentecost Peter said to the crowd, &ldquo;Repent and be baptized, each one of you, upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (Acts 2:38). Forgiveness of sins is based upon the redemption of Christ accomplished through His death (Acts 10:43; Eph. 1:7; 1 Cor. 15:3); it is the initial and basic blessing of God&rsquo;s full salvation. Based upon it, the blessing of God&rsquo;s full salvation goes forth and consummates in the receiving of the gift of the Holy Spirit. Forgiveness of sins, therefore, is a main item of the proclamation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. FREEDOM</h2>
<p>Based upon the redemption of Christ, the believers have been forgiven of their sins and also freed, released, from God&rsquo;s judgment, out of the curse of the law, from God&rsquo;s wrath, and from the fear and slavery of death.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. From God&rsquo;s Judgment</h2>
<p>The believers were sinners in Adam and were subject to God&rsquo;s judgment and condemnation (Rom. 5:12, 18-19). When God forgave them, He released them from His condemnation and judged them no more (John 3:18; 5:24).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Out of the Curse of the Law</h2>
<p>All who were in Adam had sinned and contradicted the righteous law of God; thus they fell under the curse of God&rsquo;s righteous law (Rom. 3:19-20; Gal. 3:10) and became those who deserved death and perdition. Now, according to God&rsquo;s righteousness, Christ has suffered the curse of the law for the believers and has redeemed them out of the curse of the law (Gal. 3:13) to release them, to set them free.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. From God&rsquo;s Wrath</h2>
<p>Because men have sinned and violated God&rsquo;s righteousness, they are under God&rsquo;s wrath and have become children of wrath (Eph. 2:3). Hence, God&rsquo;s wrath is waiting to explode on them (John 3:36), like thunder about to roar. Now, since the Lord Jesus has suffered the penalty of God&rsquo;s wrath on the cross on behalf of the believers according to God&rsquo;s righteousness and has made redemption for their sins, He delivers them from God&rsquo;s future wrath; that is, He releases them from God&rsquo;s wrath (Rom. 5:9; 1 Thes. 1:10).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. From the Fear and Slavery of Death</h2>
<p>Everyone has sinned, so everyone must die; and after death, there is judgment. This is what God has reserved for men (Heb. 9:27), and no one who has sinned can escape. Hence, man&rsquo;s entire life is under the shadow of death; he is constantly threatened, controlled, and enslaved by death, having no freedom whatsoever (Heb. 2:15). Through His death on the cross the Lord Jesus has destroyed the Devil, who has the might of death (Heb. 2:14); He also nullified death (2 Tim. 1:10) that He might release us who were threatened, bound, and enslaved by death (Heb. 2:15), setting us free from the dominion of death.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Forgiveness of sins is the first part of God&rsquo;s redemption, and it is received by us immediately upon our believing. It enables God to grant us the other parts of His redemption. When God forgives us of our sins, He not only cancels the charges of sin against us before God that we may be delivered from His righteous judgment, but also causes our sins to leave us. Furthermore, once He forgives us, He erases our sins from His memory and remembers them no longer. In the whole universe, only God and the Son of Man, Jesus, have the position of authority to forgive sins. God&rsquo;s forgiveness is based upon the blood of the Lord Jesus. According to God&rsquo;s righteousness, the Lord died on the cross and shed His blood for us, satisfying God&rsquo;s righteous requirement, so that God can legally forgive us of our sins according to His righteousness. However, if we, the sinners, desire to receive the grace of God&rsquo;s forgiveness, we must repent and believe. As long as we are willing to repent and believe, no matter how great or how broad our sins are, God&rsquo;s forgiveness, which is based upon the precious blood of the Lord Jesus, can encompass them all. The grace of God&rsquo;s forgiveness causes us to fear Him and refrain from doing things that are displeasing to Him; it also causes us to love Him and please Him. Furthermore, forgiveness is a gift given by the exalted Christ and a main item of the believers&rsquo; proclamation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>Freedom is the second part of redemption. Based upon the redemption of Christ, the believers have been forgiven of their sins, and they are thus freed, released, from God&rsquo;s judgment, out of the curse of the law, from God&rsquo;s wrath, and from the fear and slavery of death.</p>
