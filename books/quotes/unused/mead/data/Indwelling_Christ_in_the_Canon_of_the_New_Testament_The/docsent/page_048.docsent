   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE INDWELLING CHRIST IN COLOSSIANS Scripture Reading: Col 1:12, 18-19, 27; 2:2b, 6, 8-9; 3:4a, 10-11</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul has written at least thirteen epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first group of these epistles starts with Romans and ends with Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Following this section, there is a supplementary group containing 1 and 2 Thessalonians, 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, Philemon, and Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first main section of Romans through Colossians deals with Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In these epistles we see how Christ must be wrought into us as our life; then we will learn to live by Him, taking Him as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is by this kind of living experience that the church comes into being.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Colossians is the closing book of this section.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Actually, it seems that this book should follow Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Ephesians speaks of the Body, and Colossians speaks of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But in between we have Philippians, which shows us the practical way to have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then we have Colossians to close out this section about Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE PORTION OF THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since Colossians speaks about Christ as the Head of the Body, we would expect the book to begin in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But first of all, it tells us that Christ is the portion of all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the portion of the saints in light Col 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Praise the Lord that Christ is our portion!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This word portion in Greek means lot.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God did not allocate to us anything but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is our lot, He is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I would say that very few Christians realize that Christ is their portion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But we must see that this indwelling Christ is our practical portion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Day by day we must enjoy Him and participate in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This verse speaks about partaking.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are not the students, studying about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are the partakers of the enjoyment of Christ as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is something of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God has made us meet to be partakers of the portion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do not listen to the lies of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He would tell us that we are not worthy of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But this verse strongly tells us that we are fully qualified to be the partakers of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is our portion, and this is our lot.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>WHO IS CHRIST?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Following this, Colossians tells us who Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But it does not say that Christ is our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Rather, it says that Christ must be the One that has first place.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell Col 1:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ is the beginning, Christ is the ending, and Christ must have the preeminence.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All the fulness of God dwells in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must realize that Christ in the book of Colossians is very much deeper than in the Gospel of Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the Gospel of Luke, Christ is our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But in Colossians we see One who contains all the fulness of the Godhead, and One who must have the preeminence in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is even the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To the acknowledgment of the mystery of God, even Christ Col 2:2b, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>. The Christ revealed in this book of Colossians is the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>CHRIST RECEIVED AS OUR LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then we see that we have received such a Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him Col 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This book does not say that we have received a Savior, but rather that we have received the mystery of God, the One that contains all the fullness of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have received the One who is first in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Chapter three then tells us that this One is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When Christ, who is our life, shall appear Col 3:4a .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We could never imagine that our life could be such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He is the mystery of God, He holds all the fulness of God, He has the preeminence in everything, and He is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is indeed wonderful!</S>
