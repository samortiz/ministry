   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Joseph's realization that God was the One who had sent him to Egypt is a seed of the truth found in Romans 8:28.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Joseph's life is an illustration of this verse and an example of how everything works for good for those who love God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The seed sown in the book of Genesis grows in Romans 8:28 and is harvested in Revelation 15, where we see the overcomers standing on the sea of glass, which signifies trials, tests, and sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Joseph's brothers helped him come to the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If they had not sold him into slavery, he could not have come to Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, their selling of him ushered him to the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not complain about what your wife or husband or the saints in the church do to you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For those who love God, everything works together for good.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The crucial matter here is whether or not we love God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you love Him, even an accident works good for you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But if you do not love Him, not even graduating from a university with a doctorate will work good for you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I have suffered much throughout the years, but I have been comforted by the fact that everything works good for me.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whenever I undergo suffering, I remember Romans 8:28 and I am comforted immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As a young man of seventeen years of age, Joseph needed to undergo trials and testings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because Joseph was the favorite of his father Jacob, he lived in a pleasant environment, and there was no way for him to suffer anything.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was always under his father's protection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But one day, according to the Lord's sovereignty, Jacob sent Joseph to his brothers, and they sold him into slavery.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Through the sufferings that came upon him as a result of this, Joseph was trained to be a ruler.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this matter we see God's wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Firstly, Joseph had the dreams in which he saw his brothers bowing down to him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But in order for this vision to be fulfilled, Joseph had to undergo a great deal of suffering, especially at the hands of those closest to him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Joseph suffered constantly from the time he was seventeen until he was thirty.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Joseph needed to pass through all these sufferings so that he might be perfected and qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God had sent Joseph to Egypt to preserve life so that a remnant might remain for the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do not be frightened by this word regarding Joseph's sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Perhaps you have asked the Lord to make you today's Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord will answer this prayer by causing you to undergo certain sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>During times of suffering you may say, "How long, O Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The dreams of others have been fulfilled, but where is the fulfillment of my dream?"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Eventually, you will be released.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Joseph was patient and denied himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He did not do anything for his own enjoyment, but for the discipline and perfection of his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In order to strengthen his brothers, Joseph revealed to them his exaltation and glory, and he told them that God had made him a father to Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In 45:13 he said, "And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Joseph's brothers considered him like Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But Joseph seemed to say, "I'm the father of Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I am even higher than you realize, for God has made me the father of Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You have seen all my glory.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Go back and tell my father all you have seen."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Joseph was not being showy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Rather, he was strengthening his brothers so that they might bring their father to him.</S>
