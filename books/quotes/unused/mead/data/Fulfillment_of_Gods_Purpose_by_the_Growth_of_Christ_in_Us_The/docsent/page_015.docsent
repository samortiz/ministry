   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOW CHRIST GETS INTO US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we have to ask again, "How can Christ get into us?"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have the Holy Spirit within us and the Holy Bible in our hand.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Holy Spirit within us is actually the wonderful Christ, the all-inclusive Christ, the compounded Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When I say the compounded Christ, I mean that now this Christ is no more simply God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is God but also man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was God incarnated to be a man, and now He still has the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is divine as well as human.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is compounded.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He also went to the cross and was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He walked into death, through death, and out of death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He was not captured by death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He conquered death, subdued death, and walked out of death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then He was resurrected, and He ascended to the heavens, where He was enthroned.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He has accomplished all these things and has attained the highest place in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His accomplishment is a complete accomplishment, and His attainment is the highest attainment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He has the divine nature and the human nature, and He has such a complete accomplishment and high attainment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is the compounded Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is the all-inclusive Christ, yet today He is within us as the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do not consider that the Holy Spirit is someone other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First Corinthians 15:45b says that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The last Adam is Christ, and the life-giving Spirit, no doubt, is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>So Christ became the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Also, 2 Corinthians 3:17 says that the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is our quotation from the Bible, not our interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord Christ is the very Holy Spirit who dwells within us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, the Bible is the breath of God, and the breath of God is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord Jesus told us that the words He speaks to us are spirit and life John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The holy Word says that all Scripture is God-breathed 2 Tim 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every word of this holy book is the breath of God, the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>So we have Christ within us as the Spirit, and we have the Bible in our hand as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The way to enjoy Christ as the Spirit is to call upon Him and to pray-read His word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When you live a life of calling on the Lord, all the barriers will be broken down.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then there will be a thorough passage for Christ to get in and to get out of you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you open the window, the air without gets in and the air within gets out.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When you call, "O Lord Jesus," the window of your being is opened, and the air gets in and gets out.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the way to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The way to touch the Word is to pray-read.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You need the calling, the praying, and the reading.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You have to mingle your reading with praying and calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
