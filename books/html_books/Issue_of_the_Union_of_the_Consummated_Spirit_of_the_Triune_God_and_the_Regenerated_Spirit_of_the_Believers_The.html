We worship You for being the speaking God. You have not ceased speaking and You have been speaking until today. In Your recovery You have already spoken for seventy-four years. We deeply feel that You will continue to speak. Here we are truly under Your gracious visitation. We are thirsty for You; we love You; we seek You; we also pursue You. Within us we definitely have a thirst, which You alone can satisfy. Not only so, Lord, we want to see the mystery in the depth of Your Word. Your Word is both simple and profound. It is so simple that even a little child can understand it. It is so profound that without Your revelation, no one can comprehend it. Hence, Lord, we ask You to give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation, a spirit that can comprehend and penetrate, a spirit that can see and obtain. Lord, may You uphold us. We want not only to be those who pursue You but also to be the God-men whom You desire. We thank You that in our midst You have opened to us the vision of the high peak so that our hearts aspire and pursue, desiring to see what it is to be a God-man and to know how to be a God-man. Lord, this is really a great mystery, a mystery of mysteries. We thank You that in Your Word is the light and the revelation of the depth. Lord, we ask You to have mercy on us all again. Open up and speak to us clearly the secret of Your mystery from the depth of Your Word. Lord, cleanse us. Cleanse our whole being so that we can be clean inside and out. Both our speaking and our listening here need Your precious blood. Lord, our lips, our ears, the eyes of our heart, and our spirit within all need the cleansing of Your precious blood. Amen.</P><P>I have sought much before the Lord for this conference. In the past year, after the Lord released the high peak of the vision, everyone has read those messages and has seen the content of this vision. According to the news I received, the response of the local churches throughout the world is unanimous. Hence, the burden within me has become heavier. After the release of the high peak of this vision, all the saints have responded favorably in the spirit and are desirous to enter into this practice. They ask, "How can we become a God-man?" Many people not only do not know how to become a God-man; they even do not know how God became a man. We all know that our Savior's incarnation was God's becoming a man. This is common to us. However, since this word is from the Bible, its intrinsic significance is profound. Those who study science realize that the crucial points in science are exceedingly mysterious and profound. But those who do not know science do not realize its profoundness. The more one knows a matter, the more he realizes the mystery it contains. In the same way, every point in the Bible is mysterious, and the particular details in each point are inexhaustible. Hence, I have within me the leading from the Lord that after completing the life-study of the entire Bible this year, we still need a "crystallization-study."</P><P>The subject of this conference is "The Issue of the Union of the Consummated Spirit of the Triune God and the Regenerated Spirit of the Believers." Simply speaking, this refers to the issue produced from the fact of the union of the Spirit of God with the spirit of man. The Spirit of God is a mystery; the spirit of man also is a mystery. Hence, the issue produced from the union of these two is the mystery of mysteries. This time we are here to see these three mysteries. Apparently, we understand all these terms; however, intrinsically we may not know them. In the six chapters of this book, although we cannot exhaust these few mysteries, we still hope to lay a foundation and open a door so that we will be able to see and gain something in a far-reaching and deep way.</P><P>In this series of messages my central burden can be expressed in a sentence, that is, "The life-giving Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God comes to regenerate, sanctify, renew, and transform the believers, to conform them to the image of the Son of God, and eventually to glorify them with the eternal glory of God that the Son of God may be the Firstborn among His many brothers, the many sons of God; thus, they become the many God-men to constitute the Body of Christ and consummately be enlarged and built up as the New Jerusalem."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. BEING THE CONSUMMATION<br>OF THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD</H2><P>First we need to see the Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God. This Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God. This term consummation implies a process. If there is no process, there will not be a consummation. Since there is a consummation, there must be a process. Some have said, "God is eternally perfect. He does not need to pass through any process." This saying is very shallow. The Bible shows us that the first process that God went through was His incarnation to be a man. He is the eternal God, yet He passed through a process to become flesh to be a man. Then this great God in human flesh lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years. His incarnation was a process; His human living also was a process. Eventually, His dying on the cross was another process. Then His entering into resurrection was yet another process. After that, His ascension was another process. He has passed through at least the five processes of incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension. Having passed through these five processes, He is now different; He has had a consummation.</P><P>Here we must see that the consummation of the Triune God is a Spirit. This Spirit is the Spirit of God revealed in the Bible; He is also the Holy Spirit commonly spoken of among Christians. However, the Spirit of God and the Holy Spirit are not simple in the revelation of the Bible. In this chapter we will see that this Spirit has at least eighteen statuses. The Bible opens by saying, "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth" (Gen. 1:1). Our God began in this way. After passing through the sixty-six books, at the end of Revelation the Bible speaks of the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth. Hence, the sixty-six books of the Bible show us that this self-existing and ever-existing God, after passing through various processes, obtains a consummation. This consummation is the Spirit.</P><P>Originally, God was simply God; but after passing through the processes, God has been consummated to become a God-man. He no longer possesses only divinity without any other elements. This consummated God-man possesses not only divinity but also humanity. Moreover, He possesses the elements of incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension. In resurrection, this consummated God-man was consummated to become the life-giving Spirit. Hence, the life-giving Spirit has become the aggregate of the processed Triune God with the elements of the man whom He became and the experiences of human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</P><P>This Spirit as the aggregate of God is joined to the regenerated spirit of the believers (that is, the spirit of the believers as the totality of the Body of Christ) to be one Body, first as the Body of Christ and ultimately consummating in the New Jerusalem. The aggregate of this God and the totality of the believers become a couple in eternity to be God's increase and expression for eternity.</P><P>The coming New Jerusalem is a constitution of the processed Triune God and the redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified believers. Its expression, for the most part, is the wall of the New Jerusalem, built with jasper (Rev. 21:18-19a). In the book of Revelation jasper signifies the appearance of God (4:3). Hence, the jasper wall signifies the corporate expression of God. Jasper is produced by the transforming work of the Spirit, who is joined to the believers as the totality of the Body of Christ. Thus, this great entity as the increase and corporate expression of God in eternity is the all-inclusive Spirit as the aggregate of the Triune God and the totality of the believers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. BEING THE COMPOUND SPIRIT<br>AS THE ANOINTING OINTMENT</H2><P>The consummated Spirit of the Triune God is the compound Spirit as the anointing ointment (Exo. 30:23-25). The Spirit's being a compound indicates that His elements are not just one but many. The compound Spirit is an ointment, not just oil. If He were just oil, He would not require compounding. However, the Spirit as an ointment requires many elements to be mingled together to become a compound ointment, which includes the elements of the divinity of Christ, the humanity of Christ, the death of Christ, the effectiveness of the death of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, and the power of the resurrection of Christ. These six elements have been mingled together to become an ointment. Hence, the Bible says that this consummated Spirit is an ointment (1 John 2:20, 27). The processed Triune God became the anointing ointment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. BEING THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT,<br>THE SPIRIT OF LIFE</H2><P>This compound Spirit is the life-giving Spirit, who is also the Spirit of life (1 Cor. 15:45b; Rom. 8:2a). The matter of giving life is not simple. God Himself is life, but it is not simple for Him to give His life to people. How can He as God give His life to us? As the God of holiness, He is holy, but we human beings are common. He is righteous, but we are unrighteous. He is bright, but we are dark. How can this God, who is holy, righteous, and bright, give His life to us, the human beings, who are not holy, not righteous, and not bright? This was not possible until He passed through the processes of incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection and became a life-giving Spirit. It was at that time that He was able to give His life to us who are common and sinful. This is because He passed through the death of the cross and resurrection to redeem us who are sinful and not proper. His redemptive death not only delivers us from sin, but it also includes many other elements which release us from the troublesome situations related to sin, thus making it possible for Him to give His life to us who are redeemed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. BEING THE LORD SPIRIT</H2><P>The consummated Spirit of the Triune God is also the Lord Spirit. God is God, and He is also the Lord. God is God, and He is also the Spirit. Eventually, He became the Lord Spirit. This is what 2 Corinthians 3:17-18 tells us. If He were not the Lord, He could not have become the Spirit. For the Lord to become the Spirit, He had to be the Lord. He is the Lord Spirit, and this Lord Spirit is for our transformation (v. 18). We are being transformed every day from one degree of glory to another degree of glory, until we are transformed into the image of the firstborn Son of God. This transformation is carried out by the Spirit who is both the Lord and the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. BEING THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST</H2><P>This compound life-giving Spirit is also the Spirit of Jesus Christ. First, He is the Spirit of God, who went through human living, death, and resurrection with Jesus Christ. Then, He is also the pneumatic Christ Himself, who has the bountiful supply of the experience of human living, death, and resurrection in His flesh. Philippians 1:19 says clearly that the Spirit of Jesus Christ has the bountiful supply. Such a Spirit has the bountiful supply and even is the bountiful supply. However, in what aspects is He the bountiful supply? He is the bountiful supply in the aspects of His incarnation, His human living, His death, and His resurrection. In these aspects there is the bountiful supply in the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. BEING THE SPIRIT</H2><P>The consummated Spirit of the Triune God is "the Spirit" (John 7:38-39; Rev. 22:17). The Bible progresses through thirty-nine books from Genesis to Malachi, and then from Malachi through the four Gospels&#151;altogether forty-three books. Suddenly, in the Gospel of John, in 7:39, we are told, "The Spirit was not yet." Why at that time was the Spirit not yet? Very few in Christianity would study this. However, the Bible says that the Spirit was not yet because Jesus Christ had not yet been glorified. This tells us that when Jesus Christ was glorified, the Spirit was there. When was Jesus Christ glorified? Jesus Christ was glorified when He was resurrected (Luke 24:26). His resurrection was His glorification. At that time the Spirit was there.</P><P>First Corinthians 15 is a chapter that speaks specifically concerning resurrection. In verse 45 it says that in the resurrec-tion of Christ the last Adam, who is Christ in the flesh, became a life-giving Spirit (v. 45b). That is to become the Spirit. The Spirit is the aggregate of the processed Triune God. The Spirit is not only the consummation of the processed Triune God but also the aggregate of the processed Triune God. The consummation refers to the completion of the processes that the Triune God went through; the aggregate refers to the sum total of the three of the Trinity&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Now He is the Father, and also the Son, and also the Spirit (Matt. 28:19). The sum total of the three as an aggregate is the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. BEING THE REALITY OF GOD, THE REALITY<br>OF CHRIST, AND THE REALITY OF RESURRECTION</H2><P>This Spirit is the reality of God because He is God. He is the reality of Christ because He is Christ. He is also the reality of resurrection (John 14:17; 1 John 5:6b).</P><P>After I had been working with Brother Nee for nearly twenty years, one day he said to me, "The Holy Spirit is the reality of resurrection." At that time I did not understand how the Holy Spirit could be the reality of resurrection. Gradually, I began to understand. If there were no God, no Christ, and no Spirit, there would be no resurrection. It is not that there was resurrection only after the Lord Jesus had resurrected. In John 11:25 the Lord told Martha, "I am the resurrection." At that time Martha was arguing about the matter of time. She said to the Lord, "Lord, my brother has died and has been buried four days. He must be stinking by now. If You had come four days earlier, he would not have died." The Lord said to her, "Martha, I am the resurrection. There is no earlier or later with Me. If I am not here, there is nothing. If I am here, I am the resurrection." However, who is this One who said to Martha, "I am the resurrection"? He is God, and God is the Spirit. This Jesus is the embodiment of God, and God is the Spirit. So, in the universe the Holy Spirit, the consummated Spirit, the life-giving Spirit, is the reality of resurrection. God is resurrection; Christ is resurrection. Hence, wherever God is and wherever Christ is, there is resurrection. Eventually, the consummated Spirit is resurrection. When we live in the Spirit, we live in resurrection.</P><P>This resurrection is the substance of God's new creation. In the old creation there is nothing of resurrection because there is no God in the old creation. However, the new creation is just God Himself. The Spirit is the substance of God's new creation. You and I were originally in the old creation, but now we are in the new creation. In the old creation we do not have the element of God. What we have is neither resurrection nor God. However, in the new creation what we have is entirely resurrection, entirely God. Hence the substance of the new creation is the Spirit. This Spirit is forever new and never becomes old.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VIII. THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT, THROUGH THE PRAYERS AND PETITIONS OF THE BELIEVERS, MINGLING WITH<br>THE LORD'S WORDS TO MAKE THEM SPIRIT AND LIFE, THAT IS, THE SPIRIT WHO GIVES LIFE</H2><P>The life-giving Spirit, through the prayers and petitions of the believers, mingles with the Lord's words to make them spirit and life, that is, the Spirit who gives life. In John 6:63 the Lord Jesus said, "The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life." Ephesians 6:17 says, "...which Spirit is the word of God." Although it is not easy to understand these words, in our experience we can comprehend them. In John 6:63 we cannot figure out how the words spoken to us by the Lord are spirit and are life. But we can find out in Ephesians 6. When we receive the word of God through prayer and petition, the word becomes the Spirit and life. If we want to enjoy the Spirit and life in the word, we must do so through prayer and petition (v. 18). Using today's word, this means that we need to pray-read. It is not enough to merely read. Those who have experience can testify that in reading the Bible, we need to repeat our reading a few more times. When we are reading, we must turn it into prayer. For example, we may read John 3:16, which says, "For God so loved the world..." If we merely read these words, we will have only the word and not the Spirit. But if we read these words in a spirit of prayer, saying, "Oh, God loves the world. God loves the world. Praise the Lord, this is too good. God loves the world...," this word becomes the Spirit. We will be enlightened and will pray with weeping, "Oh, God loves me. Lord, thank You that You love me." In this way the word becomes spirit and life. It is through prayer that the word can become spirit and life.</P><P>Many times when we pray-read the word of the Bible in this way, it causes us to be inspired and weep. Not only the word of the Bible but even the hymns affect us in this way. A few days ago I sang Hymn #1 in Hymns. I love that hymn very much. The first stanza says, "Glory be to God the Father, /And to Christ the Son,/Glory to the Holy Spirit&#151;/Ever One." Stanza two says, "As we view the vast creation, /Planned with wondrous skill,/So our hearts would move to worship,/And be still." When I came to this stanza, my tears came down. Then stanza three says, "But, our God, how great Thy yearning/To have sons who love..." By reading this I knew that what God wants is not even the beautiful creation; He yearns to have many sons. Regardless of whether it is the word of the Bible or the hymns, if we read with a spirit of prayer, often we will be moved and will shed tears. This experience shows us that the life-giving Spirit, through the prayers and petitions of the believers, mingles with the Lord's words to make them spirit and life, that is, the Spirit who gives life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IX. THIS SPIRIT BEING ALSO THE SPIRIT<br>POURED UPON THE BELIEVERS, AS A MANTLE CLOTHING THEM, TO BE THE SPIRIT OF POWER<br>TO THEM FOR ACCOMPLISHING GOD'S WORK</H2><P>This Spirit is also the poured out Spirit (Acts 2:18, 33; Luke 24:49). He is water that we can drink and that can also be poured out. This Spirit was poured upon the believers to be the mantle Spirit clothing them, like the mantle of Elijah clothing Elisha to become his power (2 Kings 2:12b-15). This mantle Spirit is the Spirit of power for the believers to accomplish God's work.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>X. BECOMING THE SEVENFOLD INTENSIFIED SPIRIT</H2><P>Finally, this Spirit becomes the sevenfold intensified Spirit. Revelation speaks of the seven Spirits (1:4; 4:5; 5:6). This is the sevenfold intensified Spirit as the One who strengthens the believers in the degradation of the church. The degradation of the church is so deep that without the seven Spirits there is no way to overcome it. In these last days the seven Spirits enable the believers to become overcomers in the midst of the degraded situation of the church. Today, in order to be the overcomers in the midst of the degradation of the church, we must have the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</P><P>In conclusion, we see that the Holy Spirit has eighteen statuses for God to become man and to make man God that God and man may be joined and mingled as one. These eighteen statuses are 1) God; 2) the Triune God; 3) the Holy Spirit; 4) becoming man; 5) passing through human living; 6) passing through death; 7) resurrecting from death; 8) ascending to the height of the heavens; 9) becoming the life-giving Spirit&#151;the Spirit of life; 10) becoming the compound Spirit as the anointing ointment; 11) becoming the consummation of the Triune God; 12) becoming the Lord Spirit; 13) becoming the Spirit; 14) becoming the Spirit of Jesus Christ; 15) becoming the Spirit of reality; 16) as the Spirit in the word of God; 17) as the outpoured Spirit&#151;the mantle Spirit&#151;the Spirit of power; 18) becoming the seven Spirits.</P><P>I hope that you will study this message thoroughly and also will do your best to prophesy in the meetings. Especially the co-workers and elders have to take the lead in this matter. You have to become newer. If you stand up to speak, you will become new. If you do not speak, you will become old. If one speaks every day, he will become new. If one closes up and does not speak, he will become old. Not to speak for the Lord is to be old; to speak for the Lord is to be new.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE REGENERATED SPIRIT<br>OF THE BELIEVERS</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Gen. 2:7; 2 Cor. 5:17; Eph. 3:16; 2:1, 5-6; John 3:5-6; 1 Pet. 1:3; John 3:36a; Gal. 2:20a; Eph. 2:22; 3:16b-17a; John 14:23b; 4:24; Rom. 1:9; 8:16; 2 Tim. 4:22; Eph. 1:17; 3:5; Rev. 1:10; 4:2; 17:3; 21:10; Eph. 4:23; 5:18; 1 Cor. 6:17</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>In God's old creation the spirit of man is the reality of man and not the person of man&#151;Gen. 2:7.</li><li>In God's new creation the spirit of the believers is the person of the man of the new creation (the inner man) of the believers&#151;2 Cor. 5:17; Eph. 3:16:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Being dead in sins&#151;Eph. 2:1.</li>	<li>Being revived and made alive through the resurrection of Christ&#151;Eph. 2:5.</li>	<li>And being enlivened and regenerated with the life of God by the life-giving Spirit in Christ's resurrection&#151;Eph. 2:6; John 3:5-6; 1 Pet. 1:3.</li>	</ol></li><li>The regenerated spirit of the believers has:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The life of God as the second life, the new life, of the believers&#151;John 3:36a.</li>	<li>Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God, the Father, Son, and Spirit, living in the believers to be the person of the believers as the new creation&#151;Gal. 2:20a.</li>	</ol></li><li>The regenerated spirit of the believers becomes the dwelling place of the processed and consummated Triune God in them (Eph. 2:22), and it also becomes their inner man (Eph. 3:16b), in which Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God dwells (2 Tim. 4:22) and from which He spreads to make His home in their heart (Eph. 3:17a); this is the processed and consummated Triune God's making an abode in the believers (John 14:23b).</li><li>The regenerated spirit of the believers becomes the organ for them to worship, serve, receive, possess, experience, and enjoy God&#151;John 4:24; Rom. 1:9; 8:16; 2 Tim. 4:22.</li><li>The regenerated spirit of the believers is also the organ for them to receive God's wisdom, revelation, and vision&#151;Eph. 1:17; 3:5; Rev. 1:10; 4:2; 17:3; 21:10.</li><li>The regenerated spirit of the believers spreads into their mind to become the renewing spirit in their mind&#151;Eph. 4:23.</li><li>The regenerated spirit of the believers is being filled with God&#151;Eph. 5:18.</li><li>The regenerated spirit of the believers and the consummated Spirit of God are mingled as one spirit&#151;1 Cor. 6:17.</li></ol><P>Prayer: Lord, we not only worship You as the speaking God, but even more we worship You that You are the Word and this Word is the Spirit. When the reality of this Spirit enters into us to be our element, it makes us God. Lord, we thank You that You became man in order to make man God. This is truly an economy incomprehensible to the angels and to men. Amen.</P><P>In the previous chapter we saw the first One in the mystery&#151;the Spirit, who is God Himself. This God who is the Spirit has passed through a number of processes. First, He became flesh (John 1:14); then He became the life-giving Spirit, that is, the Spirit of life (1 Cor. 15:45b; Rom. 8:2a). Then this Spirit became the compound Spirit as the anointing ointment (Exo. 30:23-25). He is also the Lord Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17-18), the Spirit (John 7:38-39; Rev. 22:17), the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19b), the Spirit of reality (John 14:17; 1 John 5:6b), the Spirit in the Word (John 6:63; Eph. 6:17-18a), the mantle Spirit poured upon the believers, that is, the Spirit of power (Acts 2:18, 33; Luke 24:49; 2 Kings 2:12b-15), and finally, the seven Spirits (Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6). This processed God is one yet three, three yet one. This three-one and one-three God became flesh and then became the Spirit, that is, the consummated Spirit. This is what the Bible clearly reveals to us.</P><P>Such a God passed through these processes, first that He might make God man, and ultimately that He might make man God. At the beginning of the Bible, God created the heavens and the earth and man. For four thousand years after He created man, through the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament, besides presenting some prophecies and types, nearly nothing was done as far as the accomplishment of His eternal economy is concerned. It was not until the New Testament that He came out to do something that is incomprehensible to men; that is, He was born into the womb of a virgin, remained there for nine months, and then was brought forth from the virgin's womb. He was born with the flesh, with humanity. He was God, yet He was born to be a human child and was laid in a manger. It was from that point that He began to pass through the processes. This God became a God-man, passing through thirty-three and a half years of human living, and then passing through death and resurrection. Eventually, this God-man produced tens of thousands of God-men. Peter, John, James, and Paul were included. All the believers in Christ also are included. Then after He ascended into the heavens, He poured Himself down like heavy rain to be the mantle Spirit for Peter and his company to put on as the Spirit of power to them for the carrying out of the Lord's great work of salvation. Hence, three thousand and then five thousand were saved to become the church. Not only so, this Spirit also became the Spirit of Jesus Christ with the bountiful supply to enable those who became the church to live a God-man life to live out Christ.</P><P>All these accomplishments of God depend on the Spirit. However, there is a saying that a single hand cannot produce a clapping sound. If there is only God the Spirit, there is still no way to accomplish all the matters. He needs another spirit to "clap" together with Him. This other spirit is the spirit of the regenerated believers. When God created man, He made preparation for this spirit of the believers.</P><P>There are two crucial points concerning God's creating of man. First, God created man in His image. What He created was man, but what came out was in God's likeness. God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness" (Gen. 1:26). God created man, yet what came out was not according to mankind but according to God's kind. God created all things after their own kind, but He created man not according to mankind but according to God's kind. This laid a foundation for man so that he could become God in life and nature, but without any share in the Godhead. This is the truth in the Bible.</P><P>The second crucial point in God's creation of man was that God created a spirit in man (Gen. 2:7; Zech. 12:1). Since God is Spirit, if there were no spirit in man, there would be no way for man to contact this God who is Spirit. If God had only created man after God's kind, having God's likeness yet not having an organ to contact and receive Him, God's heart's desire would have had no way to be fulfilled. Hence, God created man with a spirit to enable man to contact and receive Him. We all know that in the universe, the devil and the demons are evil. The Bible uses the serpent to signify the devil and the scorpions to signify the demons. Concerning the angels, although they are not evil, they are merely serving spirits (Heb. 1:14); hence, they are insignificant. In the universe, only man, who has a spirit, is important. Zechariah 12:1 says, "...Jehovah, who stretches forth the heavens and lays the foundations of the earth and forms the spirit of man within him." Here we have the three great keys in the universe: the heavens, the earth, and man. God created the heavens, the earth, man, and especially a spirit for man. This is God's preparation within man for His economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. IN GOD'S OLD CREATION THE SPIRIT OF MAN IS<br>THE REALITY OF MAN AND NOT THE PERSON OF MAN</H2><P>In the old creation the spirit of man is the reality of man (Gen. 2:7). If we did not have a human spirit, we would be more or less like the animals. Although man is also a kind of animal, he is different from the other animals. Man has a spirit, whereas the other animals do not. Many people love dogs, but although they are clever and lovable, dogs do not have a spirit. Even if a dog stayed in your home for five years, it would still be the same, not knowing anything. But if you give birth to a child, after five days he will become different. After fifty days he will even be able to smile. After another few months, he will even call "Mama!" But regardless of how long a dog stays in your home, it will never call you "Mama!" No matter how you teach it, it will not understand. Yet if a child stays in your home for eight or nine months, he will be able to call you "Mama!" After another period of time, he will be able to discern who is Daddy and who is Mommy. Gradually, the child will grow. When he is five or six years old, his parents may talk to him about God. Gradually, he will know God and he will pray to Him. If you teach a dog, telling it, "God is your Creator; He is the Lord of heaven and earth; you need to worship Him," the dog will at most wag its tail and walk away. The little dog is just an animal. It does not have a spirit; it has no way to understand God. You can teach it, but it cannot understand. But with little children, after they become five or six years old, you can teach them and they can understand and say, "Lord Jesus, my mother told me that You died for me. Lord Jesus, I thank You." This is because man not only has God's image outwardly; man also has a spirit within that can contact God. The spirit of man is the reality of man. Without this spirit, there is no reality.</P><P>In God's old creation, the spirit of man is not the person of man. The person of man is the soul. Hence, both the Old and New Testaments call men "souls." The house of Jacob, consisting of seventy persons, went down to Egypt, but the Bible did not say "seventy persons" but "seventy souls" (Exo. 1:5). On the day of Pentecost three thousand people were saved, yet the Bible says, "There were added on that day about three thousand souls" (Acts 2:41). In the old creation man is a soul, but the reality within him is the human spirit. This spirit is the organ for contacting and receiving God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. IN GOD'S NEW CREATION THE SPIRIT<br>OF THE BELIEVERS IS THE PERSON OF<br>THE MAN OF THE NEW CREATION<br>(THE INNER MAN) OF THE BELIEVERS</H2><P>In God's new creation the spirit of the believers is not merely an organ for contacting and receiving God, but it has become the person of the man of the new creation (the inner man) of the believers (2 Cor. 5:17; Eph. 3:16). In the old creation the soul is the person of man; in the new creation the spirit is the person of man. Today it is the spirit that is the master and the person within us. In the old creation our person is the soul. In the new creation our person is the spirit; the soul is merely an organ in us. In the man of the new creation, there is a Lord who is Christ. This Christ dwells in our new man to be our Lord and our person. Galatians 2:20 says, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me." This means that our old "I" has been terminated; our soul is finished. Now it is no longer the "I," the soul, who lives but Christ who lives in us to be our new person. He lives in our spirit and has become one with our spirit. Hence, the person in our being as a new creation, on the one hand, is our spirit and, on the other hand, is Christ. Both are the person in our new man.</P><P>The spirit of man was created by God. It became dead in sins due to man's transgressions and fall and lost the function of contacting God (Eph. 2:1). Since man is sinful, he needs redemption. Through the redeeming death of Christ, the spirit of man has been enlivened through the resurrection of Christ (2:5). However, this kind of enlivening is still not resurrection; it is just like a dead person being enlivened from death. Our spirit is first enlivened; then it is regenerated with the life of God in the resurrection of Christ, by the life-giving Spirit, who is the wonderful, processed Spirit (Eph. 2:6; John 3:5-6; 1 Pet. 1:3). Man was dead in sins. Based on the redemption of Christ, the Holy Spirit comes to enliven man and then resurrect him together with Christ, in the resurrection of Christ, by the life of God to regenerate him.</P><P>Regeneration is to bring God into man. The life-giving Spirit who regenerates man is just God Himself. Therefore, when this life-giving Spirit regenerates man, God enters into man. God's coming in is Christ's coming in because Christ is the embodiment of God (Col. 2:9). Christ's coming in is just life's coming in because Christ is life (John 14:6). In this way the Spirit, God, Christ, and life all come into man. When we believe in the Lord, the processed and consummated Spirit enters into us. When we say, "O Lord Jesus, You are my Savior; I receive You," at that moment the Spirit comes into us. When He comes, God comes; when He comes, Christ comes; when He comes, life comes. This consummated Spirit comes into us not to bring us some doctrines but to bring God, Christ, and life into us to be our elements so that our deadened spirit can be resurrected and thus be regenerated. Hence, regeneration is to remake, rebuild, and reconstitute us to be a person of the new creation with God, Christ, and life as the elements.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE REGENERATED SPIRIT OF THE BELIEVERS HAS:</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Life of God as the Second Life,<br>the New Life, of the Believers</H2><P>In the believers' regenerated spirit there is the life of God as the second life of the believers, that is, the new life of the believers (John 3:36a). The initial life of the believers is the created life from Adam. The second life of the believers is the uncreated life that they received from God. This uncreated life becomes the new life of the believers, which is another life received by the believers apart from the created life. As soon as we believe in the Lord, God Himself enters into us to be our life. Hence, we have two lives. When I was saved at the age of twenty, I was striving in my studying. But one afternoon I heard and believed in the gospel and received the Lord. When I came out of that meeting, my whole being was changed. As I was walking on the street, I lifted my head to look at heaven and prayed to God, saying, "God, from now on, even if the whole world is given to me, I don't want it anymore. I only want You." I believe that everyone who is saved and regenerated has a similar experience. Yet this does not mean that we ourselves have changed; it means that another life has come into us to change us. This other life is God, and it is also Christ. Thus, regeneration is to be born of God that we may have the life of God to become a God-man.</P><P>The man that was created by God had God's image but did not have God or the life of God within him. Hence, in the old creation man only looks like God and is like a photograph of God. Suppose you see a photograph of me. If you point at this photograph and say that it is me, I will say that it is not me, because the photograph does not have my life. If you say that the photograph is not me, I will say that it is me, because the photograph is my image. A person has no way to enter into his own photograph to cause that photograph to have his life and become him. However, after passing through the processes, God can enter into the man who has His image to be his life so that he can be the same kind as God in life and nature but not in His Godhead.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Christ as the Embodiment of the Triune God, the Father, Son, and Spirit, Living<br>in the Believers to Be the Person<br>of the Believers as the New Creation</H2><P>In the regenerated spirit of the believers there is also Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;living within the believers to be the person of the believers as the new creation (Gal. 2:20a). Therefore, we who have been regenerated have not only a new life but also a new person. This new life is God, and this new person is Christ, who is the embodiment of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE REGENERATED SPIRIT OF THE BELIEVERS BECOMES THE DWELLING PLACE OF THE PROCESSED AND CONSUMMATED TRIUNE GOD IN THE BELIEVERS</H2><P>The regenerated spirit of the believers becomes the dwelling place of the processed and consummated Triune God in the believers (Eph. 2:22). There are many things involved here. We build houses for us to dwell in. Likewise, if God wants to make our regenerated spirit His dwelling place, there is the need for a process of building.</P><P>The regenerated spirit of the believers becomes not only the dwelling place of God but also the inner man of the believers (Eph. 3:16b), in which Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God dwells (2 Tim. 4:22) to spread and make His home in the hearts of the believers (Eph. 3:17a). Christ must spread from the regenerated spirit of the believers to the hearts of the believers. Originally, my office in my home was quite small, but recently I enlarged it. As soon as we are saved, the Lord comes in and stays in our spirit. However, He is restricted to our spirit and is suffering there, desiring to spread out from our spirit. Hence, He wants to spread from our spirit, which is the base, to our heart. This kind of spreading enables Him to make home and build up His dwelling place in us.</P><P>John 14:23 says, "If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him." This is the processed and consummated Triune God making His home in the believers. This making home is the building. On the one hand, it is the building of the house of God that He may dwell in us; on the other hand, it is the building of our house that we may dwell in Him. This twofold dwelling place is the mutual dwelling place of God and man. If God does not dwell in man, God will not be able to become man; if man does not dwell in God, neither will man be able to become God. For God to become man, He must gain man as His home; for man to become God, he needs to obtain God as his home. This mutual dwelling place is a joining of God and man with each other. However, if both parties are not of the same kind, they cannot become a mutual dwelling place and stay with each other. If you are not God but are only man, how can you dwell with God? If God is not man but is only God, how can He dwell with you? Hence, the preparation of the dwelling place in John 14 is God becoming man and man becoming God that God and man, man and God, can be joined and mingled together to become a mutual dwelling place.</P><P>This preparation of the dwelling place requires much building work. On God's side, in order to dwell with man, He Himself had to pass through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. On man's side, in order to dwell with God, man likewise has to pass through regeneration, sanctification, renewing, and transformation. All these are the work of building the dwelling place of God and man so that ultimately God and man can become a mutual dwelling place.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. THE REGENERATED SPIRIT OF THE BELIEVERS BECOMES THE ORGAN FOR THEM TO WORSHIP, SERVE, RECEIVE, POSSESS, EXPERIENCE, AND ENJOY GOD</H2><P>The regenerated spirit of the believers not only becomes the dwelling of God but also becomes the organ for them to worship, serve, receive, possess, experience, and enjoy God (John 4:24; Rom. 1:9; 8:16; 2 Tim. 4:22). This is like the receiver within a wireless radio that enables the radio to receive the radio waves. Our regenerated spirit within us is the organ for us to receive God that we may contact Him, worship Him, serve Him, and even possess Him, experience Him, and enjoy Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE REGENERATED SPIRIT OF THE BELIEVERS<br>IS ALSO THE ORGAN FOR THEM TO RECEIVE<br>GOD'S WISDOM, REVELATION, AND VISION</H2><P>The regenerated spirit of the believers is also the organ for the believers to receive God's wisdom, revelation, and vision (Eph. 1:17; 3:5; Rev. 1:10; 4:2; 17:3; 21:10). The genuine wisdom comes from God. Our regenerated spirit enables us to receive the wisdom that comes from God. Not only so, this wisdom enables us to understand God's revelation. As soon as God comes into our spirit, we receive revelation. This revelation causes us to see something, and what we see becomes a vision. All these are matters that occur in our regenerated spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. THE REGENERATED SPIRIT OF THE BELIEVERS SPREADS INTO THEIR MIND TO BECOME<br>THE RENEWING SPIRIT IN THEIR MIND</H2><P>The regenerated spirit also spreads into the mind of the believers to become the renewing spirit in the believers' mind so that their entire being can be renewed (Eph. 4:23). A person is controlled by his mind. Whatever a person thinks, he will do. Before we were saved, what we had were old thinking and old thoughts. Now, after being saved, we have a regenerated new spirit. However, this is not enough. We still need a new mind. When the regenerated spirit of the believers spreads into their mind, the mind of the believers becomes a renewed mind. Hence, the regenerated spirit of the believers becomes the renewing spirit in their mind that their entire being may be renewed.</P><P>Before we were saved, we had our particular lifestyle. For example, a mother admonishes her daughter from her youth concerning how to dress herself properly. However, as the daughter grows up, she has her own ideas and dresses in a strange way. The mother admonishes her, but she does not listen. One day this daughter hears the gospel and is saved. Eventually, her mind is renewed. She no longer dresses herself in that worldly way. This is what is spoken of in Ephesians 4:23 concerning a believer after he is saved: his regenerated spirit spreads into his mind to become the renewing spirit in his mind. This causes his mind to be transformed and renewed. Thus he will no longer be the same.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VIII. THE REGENERATED SPIRIT OF THE BELIEVERS<br>IS BEING FILLED WITH GOD</H2><P>The regenerated spirit of the believers also needs to be filled with God (Eph. 5:18). Paul said that we should not be drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but should be filled in spirit. To be drunk with wine is to have our body saturated with wine. We, the believers, need to be filled with God and saturated with God in our spirit. All the experienced ones know that every day when we spend some time, eight or ten minutes, remaining before God to contact Him and allow Him to saturate and soak us within, it is as if the spirit within us takes a shower in the Spirit of God. This causes us to be filled with God. Eventually, both within and without, we will be God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IX. THE REGENERATED SPIRIT OF THE BELIEVERS<br>AND THE CONSUMMATED SPIRIT OF GOD<br>ARE MINGLED AS ONE SPIRIT</H2><P>Finally, the regenerated spirit of the believers and the consummated Spirit of God are mingled as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). Thus, the Spirit of God is no longer like a single hand that cannot produce clapping sounds; rather, the two spirits can "clap" together. Today, the Spirit of God and the human spirit are mingled as one within us so that we can live a God-man life, a life that is God yet man and man yet God. Hence, the God-man life is a living of the two spirits, the Spirit of God and the spirit of man joined and mingled together as one.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE UNION OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD<br>AND THE SPIRIT OF THE BELIEVERS</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: John 3:5-6; 1:12-13; 3:15-16; Matt. 16:24; Rom. 6:19, 22; 15:16; 2 Pet. 1:4; Titus 3:5b; Rom. 12:2a; 2 Cor. 4:16; Rom. 6:4; 2 Cor. 3:18; Phil. 3:21; Rom. 8:29, 30, 23; Eph. 4:30; Col. 3:4b; 1 Pet. 5:10a; 2 Tim. 2:10; Heb. 2:10</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of the believers brings God into man that God and man may be joined and mingled together&#151;divinity and humanity blended as one, without a third nature being produced.</li><li>In regenerating the believers:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The Spirit of God regenerating the believers in their receiving spirit with the life of God that they may become children of God&#151;John 3:5-6; 1:12-13.</li>	<li>That, in addition to their natural life, the believers may have the eternal life of God and live by it while denying their natural life&#151;John 3:15-16; Matt. 16:24.</li>	</ol></li><li>In sanctifying the believers&#151;Rom. 6:19, 22; 15:16:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Dispensing God's holy nature into the inward parts of the believers to gradually sanctify every inward part with the element of God's holy nature.</li>	<li>That the believers may in substance partake of and enjoy God's nature of holiness and thus become holy&#151;2 Pet. 1:4.</li>	</ol></li><li>In renewing the believers&#151;Titus 3:5b; Rom. 12:2a:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Infusing the inward parts of the believers with God's attributes, which are forever new, can never become old, and are everlasting and unfading.</li>	<li>That by passing through the death of Christ on the cross, the discipline of the Spirit of God in the environment, and the metabolic dispensing of the Spirit as life, the believers may be renewed day by day by putting off the oldness of the old creation and living out the newness of life of the new creation&#151;2 Cor. 4:16; Rom. 6:4.</li>	</ol></li><li>In transforming the believers&#151;2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 12:2a:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Transforming the believers metabolically with the life element of the firstborn Son of God, the first God-man, who passed through death and entered into resurrection, until they are transformed into His image from one degree of glory to another higher degree of glory and are raptured and transfigured to enter into His glory&#151;Phil. 3:21.</li>	<li>This is the mass reproduction of the firstborn Son of God as the prototype to make every believer a God-man just like Christ, the firstborn Son of God.</li>	</ol></li><li>In conforming the believers&#151;Rom. 8:29:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Conformation is the consummation of the transformation of the believers in the life of Christ as the firstborn Son of God, the first God-man.</li>	<li>Conformation is also the preparation of the believers before the transfiguration and glorification of their body.</li>	</ol></li><li>In glorifying the believers&#151;Rom. 8:30, 23; Eph. 4:30; Col. 3:4b; 1 Pet. 5:10a; 2 Tim. 2:10; Heb. 2:10:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The work of the Spirit of God in glorifying the believers begins with His regenerating the believers with the life of God's glory.</li>	<li>After regenerating the believers, the Spirit of God continues, step by step, with His work of sanctifying, renewing, transforming, and conforming to transfuse the believers with the Triune God Himself as glory, until the glory of God's life saturates the believers and is manifested in their body. Thus the work of the Spirit of God in glorifying the believers reaches its consummation.</li>	</ol></li><li>The above six steps are accomplished by the joining of "the Spirit with our spirit" (Rom. 8:16) as "one spirit" (1 Cor. 6:17). If this were not so, even though the gospel of God is "powerful" (Rom. 1:16), it still would not have any power or accomplish anything in the believers.</li></ol><P>In this chapter we will consider the union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of the believers. This is the central point of this series of messages. We have used this term union quite much, but concerning the union of God and man, we do not have adequate knowledge. The union of God and man is altogether a matter of the union of the two spirits, the Spirit of God and the spirit of man. God is Spirit and man has a spirit; thus, these two spirits can be united together as one. But how does the union of these two spirits occur? This is the deepest mystery in the Bible, and it is difficult for man to comprehend.</P><P>The Bible in total has sixty-six books. The first thirty-nine books are the Old Testament, which has nothing to do with the union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of man. In the New Testament the four Gospels record the greatest thing that ever happened in the universe, that is, God coming to be a man. After God created man, for a period of four thousand years, besides speaking some prophecies and presenting some types, He did not do anything as far as the union of God and man is concerned. It was at the beginning of the New Testament that He did a great thing, that is, He was begotten in the womb of a virgin and remained there for nine months. This begetting is the union of God and man. It is also the joining and mingling of God and man. We have a new hymn which says, "What miracle! What mystery!/That God and man should blended be!" This joining and mingling began in the womb of the virgin. God did not merely stay there temporarily but remained there for nine months. Matthew 1:20 says that what was begotten in Mary was of the Holy Spirit. In other words, it was God who was begotten in Mary. He remained there for nine months; then He was born with the human flesh and the human nature. He was God, but He was born to be a man. He was God, but He became in the likeness of a man and was found in fashion as a man (Phil. 2:7-8). In Genesis chapter one God merely created man in His likeness. However, when He came forth from the womb of the virgin Mary, He Himself became in the likeness of a man. When God created man, He created him according to His likeness. When He came forth from the virgin's womb, He became in the likeness of a man.</P><P>God became a man and lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years. During that time many things took place concerning Him. That was His human living. The four Gospels as the first books of the New Testament specifically speak about God's living on the earth as a man. That is the story of the union of God and man. God was on the earth, yet He was not expressed in the image of God; rather, He was manifested fully in the likeness of man. He lived and walked on the earth in the likeness of man; yet within He was united with God. He was man and also God. From the outside, it appeared that He was merely a man; but in actuality He was God. He was the union of God and man.</P><P>After the four Gospels, from Acts to Revelation there are a total of twenty-three books, all of which present the story of the union of God and the believers. The union of God and man, causing the two to be one, is a matter that is most difficult to study and understand in the Bible. Hence, the portions of the Bible that speak of this union are also the most difficult to translate. To translate the Gospels is relatively easy, but to translate the Epistles is rather difficult because what is spoken of in those twenty-three books are not matters that belong to human culture, but things that had never occurred in human culture. Because of the absence of the culture of the union of God and man, there is a shortage of language to express it. This forced the translators of the Bible to create some new terms. In the ancient Chinese classical writings we cannot find things such as regeneration, sanctification, renewing, transformation, conformation, and glorification. Even if they contain similar terms, they refer to matters in the old culture which have nothing to do with the revelation in the Bible concerning the union of God and man.</P><P>We common and sinful men are made God through the six big steps of regeneration, sanctification, renewing, transformation, conformation, and glorification. Regeneration is the initiation; glorification is the consummation; sanctification, renewing, transformation and conformation are the process between these two ends. The twenty-three books from Acts to Revelation speak of these six big steps. After these six big steps are completed, an issue is produced, which is the holy city, New Jerusalem. This New Jerusalem is the great issue of the union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of man in these six big steps. In this chapter we will consider these six big steps and the wonderful things that happen in them. All these steps are also what we, the believers, must pass through today.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE UNION OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD AND THE SPIRIT OF THE BELIEVERS BRINGS GOD INTO MAN THAT GOD AND MAN MAY BE JOINED AND MINGLED TOGETHER</H2><P>The union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of the believers brings God into man that God and man may be joined and mingled together. This causes divinity and humanity to be blended as one, yet without producing a third nature. This is the crucial significance of joining and mingling. This thought is very deep. This is something that the Lord has shown us in His recovery. Outside the Lord's recovery, in Catholicism, Protestantism, and the Moslem religion, nearly no one teaches this matter. They do not know this mystery of the two natures of God and man blended to become one yet without producing a third nature.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. IN REGENERATING THE BELIEVERS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Spirit of God Regenerating the Believers in Their Receiving Spirit with the Life of God That They May Become Children of God</H2><P>The union and blending of the Spirit of God and the spirit of man has altogether six big steps. The first step is the regenerating of the believers. The Spirit of God regenerates the believers in their receiving spirit with the life of God that they may become children of God (John 3:5-6; 1:12-13). After I was saved, I paid much attention to this term regeneration. I checked with the pastors. In general, they told me that regeneration, as the Chinese say, means that everything of the past died yesterday, and everything from this day forward is born today. I could not accept their explanation. That is a clich&#233; among the Chinese. The Chinese people had spoken about this for thousands of years; why was there the need for foreign missionaries to come to China to teach this to us? Later I attended the Brethren meetings. They published a book called The Meaning of Regeneration. After I read that book, I was very disappointed because it did not explain at all what regeneration is. One day I read a book by T. Austin-Sparks, who said that regeneration is for man to have another life, the life of God, in addition to the human life he already has. I responded to that explanation. Once a person is regenerated, he has two lives; in addition to the human life, he has obtained another life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. That, in Addition to Their Natural Life,<br>the Believers May Have the Eternal Life of God and Live by It While Denying Their Natural Life</H2><P>Through regeneration the believers have the eternal life of God in addition to their natural life, that they may live by this life while denying their natural life (John 3:15-16; Matt. 16:24). Although we have spoken concerning this matter quite thoroughly in the Lord's recovery, in our living we do not practice it thoroughly or experience it adequately. It does not matter whether a person is gentle or rough, or whether his natural disposition is quick or slow; his salvation does not depend on improvement or refinement. Some consider that because the Lord Jesus once said, "Unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens" (Matt. 5:20), the believers should improve their behavior. The rough ones should not be rough anymore. The gentle ones should be more gentle. This kind of interpretation of the Bible is according to the natural concept. According to the truth in the Bible concerning the union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of the believers, it is altogether wrong for the believers to improve their behavior. To increase gentleness is wrong; to improve roughness also is wrong. This is because the natural life, whether gentle or rough, must be completely denied. When we speak of denying the life that is rough, everyone agrees; but when we speak of denying the life that is gentle, some will strongly disagree. The regeneration revealed in the Bible is not a religion, nor is it a set of moral teachings for improving oneself. Regeneration is to have God as life in addition to our original, human life. Hence, we should not live by our original life, our first life; rather, we must deny our first life and live by our second life.</P><P>To practice denying our natural life and living by the life of God is not easy. I have been learning this lesson for nearly seventy years. Although many times the words I spoke were right and good, after I spoke them, I had a feeling within, which may be considered as a voice that adjusted me, saying, "Did you speak those good words by yourself, or was it the Lord as life within you leading you to speak?" What the Lord desires is that we would not speak out of ourselves but out of the life of God that is within us. Paul said, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me" (Gal. 2:20). We may be very familiar with this word, but in our daily life we nearly have not allowed Christ to live. Instead, we allow our self to live. Even in our church life today, our evaluation of the brothers and sisters is often not according to the principle of regeneration, but according to the principle of improvement. Any stress on the improvement of behavior is contrary to the truth of regeneration.</P><P>Paul said, "O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly portrayed crucified?" (Gal. 3:1). The cross is the center of all God's operation in His economy. Hence, Paul wanted to bring the believers who were distracted by the law back to the cross. God's New Testament revelation is not that man should keep the law but that man should deny himself and accept the one matter accomplished by God in His processes, that is, the cross. This cross has fully terminated our old man so that we will no longer live by our life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. IN SANCTIFYING THE BELIEVERS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Dispensing God's Holy Nature<br>into the Inward Parts of the Believers</H2><P>The union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of man is seen also in the sanctifying of the believers. The Spirit of God dispenses God's holy nature into the inward parts of the believers to gradually sanctify every inward part with the element of God's holy nature (Rom. 6:19, 22; 15:16). Very few in Christianity speak about sanctification in a clear and full way. They speak mainly about becoming holy and pure. However, in the original language the word sanctification has the meaning of being separated or set apart in a strong way. Hence, we created a Chinese term that means "being made holy by being separated." According to my knowledge, the equivalent of the word sanctification is not found in the Chinese dictionary, since without such a culture there is not such a language. What God is doing is first to sanctify us by separation, and then to sanctify us by transformation. God not only sets us apart but also sanctifies us by transforming us.</P><P>Sanctification by separation is for sanctification by transformation, and the latter is for the transformation of our entire being. In the matter of our sanctification, the Spirit of God first comes into our spirit to separate us in order to make us holy. Then God's nature of holiness also begins the process of transformation within us to sanctify us. Neither of these significances of sanctification is brought out in Chinese theology. Instead, Chinese theology puts a particular emphasis on purity. Of course, we may say that sanctification in its broad sense includes the meaning of purification, since separation plus the process of transformation for sanctification equal purification. However, this kind of teaching is somewhat far-fetched. What the Bible speaks about is sanctification by separation and transformation. Regeneration requires the life of God; sanctification also requires the life of God. Regeneration requires the life of God to beget us, whereas sanctification requires the nature of God in His life to separate and transform us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. That the Believers May in Substance<br>Partake of and Enjoy God's Nature<br>of Holiness and Thus Become Holy</H2><P>The life of God has its holy nature. It is this nature of the life of God that sanctifies us by separation and transformation. After we are saved, we have Christ as our life (Col. 3:4) and can partake of the divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4). To partake of means to enjoy. We believers who are in Christ have His life and can enjoy His nature. The holy nature of God is an element that is added into our being, that enters into our various inward parts, such as our mind, emotion, and will. This causes our various inward parts to be separated from all things outside of God.</P><P>Not only so, the life of God also sanctifies us to transform us. It sanctifies by transforming every part of our being so that every part of our being may be like God. Our mind becomes like the mind of God; our emotion becomes like the emotion of God; and our will becomes like the will of God. Hence, one who has been sanctified by being separated and transformed becomes like God in the attitude of his speaking and in his actions and gestures, even in his judgments and views. He becomes God in life and nature, but not in His Godhead.</P><P>It is not simple for God to become man in order to make man God. For God to make us God, the first step is that He has to regenerate us by putting His life into us. The second step is that He has to sanctify us by separating and transforming us with the divine nature in His life. This causes us to be the same as God not only in life and nature but also in every part of our entire being.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. IN RENEWING THE BELIEVERS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Infusing the Inward Parts<br>of the Believers with God's Attributes,<br>Which Are Forever New, Can Never Become<br>Old, and Are Everlasting and Unfading</H2><P>The union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of man is also seen in the renewing of the believers (Titus 3:5b; Rom. 12:2a). The Spirit of God renews the believers by infusing the inward parts of the believers with God's attributes, which are forever new, can never become old, and are everlasting and unfading. God has many attributes, such as love, light, holiness, and righteousness. Besides these, God's attributes also include His being forever new, never becoming old, and being everlasting and unfading. We all know that in the old creation, anything, even if it is not used, will become old and decrepit after a period of time. Hence, we who are in the old creation need to be renewed by allowing God to infuse into us His attributes, which are forever new, can never become old, and are everlasting and unfading, in order to transform our old creation into the new creation. All the experienced ones know that in our fellowship with God, there is always an infusion taking place within us; that is, the attributes of God are being infused into our nature, which belongs to the old creation, to renew it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. That by Passing through the Death of<br>Christ on the Cross, the Discipline of the Spirit of God in the Environment, and the Metabolic Dispensing of the Spirit as Life, the Believers May Be Renewed Day by Day to Live Out<br>the Newness of Life of the New Creation</H2><P>The Spirit of God renews the believers by causing them to pass through the death of Christ on the cross, the discipline of the Spirit of God in the environment, and the metabolic dispensing of the Spirit as life, that they may be renewed day by day (2 Cor. 4:16) by putting off the oldness of the old creation and living out the newness of life of the new creation (Rom. 6:4). We live out the newness of life by being renewed. The Spirit of God infuses into us the divine attributes, which are forever new, never become old, and are everlasting and unfading, that we may pass through the death of Christ on the cross and the discipline of the Spirit of God in the environment, plus the metabolic dispensing of the Spirit as life, to be renewed day by day by putting off the oldness of the old creation and living out the newness of life of the new creation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. IN TRANSFORMING THE BELIEVERS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Transforming the Believers Metabolically<br>with the Life Element of the Firstborn Son<br>of God, Who Passed through Death<br>and Entered into Resurrection</H2><P>The union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of man is also seen in the transforming of the believers. Second Corinthians 3:18 says that we, the believers, will be transformed gradually into the same image as the Lord from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit. Romans 12:2 says, "And do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind." To be renewed is to have a new essence added into us to cause a metabolic transformation. Transformation is the intrinsic and metabolic process of the working of God, which on the one hand is gradually eliminating our old and natural element, and on the other hand is spreading the life and nature of God throughout our entire being to be the new element of our entire being.</P><P>The Spirit of God transforms the believers metabolically with the life element of the firstborn Son of God, the first God-man, who passed through death and entered into resurrection, until they are transformed into His image from one degree of glory to another higher degree of glory and are raptured and transfigured to enter into His glory (Phil. 3:21). Here we do not say "Christ" but "the firstborn Son of God," because we are being conformed to the image of God's firstborn Son (Rom. 8:29). The firstborn Son of God is the prototype, and we, the many sons, are His mass reproduction.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. This Is the Mass Reproduction of<br>the Firstborn Son of God as the Prototype<br>to Make Every Believer a God-man Just Like Christ, the Firstborn Son of God</H2><P>The transformation of the believers is the mass reproduction of the firstborn Son of God as the prototype of a God-man to make every believer a God-man just like Christ, the firstborn Son of God. Hence, the Spirit of God transforms the believers into the likeness of God. Therefore, we can see that in the four steps of regeneration, sanctification, renewing, and transformation, the Spirit of God is working step by step in our human spirit to make us God-men.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. IN CONFORMING THE BELIEVERS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Being the Consummation of<br>the Transformation of the Believers<br>in the Life of Christ as the Firstborn<br>Son of God, the First God-man</H2><P>The union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of man is also seen in the conforming of the believers (Rom. 8:29). Conformation is the consummation of the transformation of the believers in the life of Christ as the firstborn Son of God, the first God-man, which is just the consummation of the four steps of regeneration, sanctification, renewing, and transformation. The issue of being conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God is that we are made God-men.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Being Also the Preparation<br>of the Believers before the Transfiguration<br>and Glorification of Their Body</H2><P>Conformation is also the preparation of the believers before the transfiguration and glorification of their body. Philippians 3:21 says that when Christ returns, He "will transfigure the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of His glory, according to His operation by which He is able even to subject all things to Himself." This is what is mentioned in Romans and Ephesians as the redemption of our body (Rom. 8:23; Eph. 1:14; 4:30). The transfiguration of our body is the redemption of our body. The transfiguration of our body, or the redemption of our body, is not something accomplished instantly; it is the issue of the gradual working of the Spirit of God within our spirit. This working begins with regeneration, passes through sanctification, renewing, and transformation, and arrives at conformation. This is the consummation of our transformation in life. Conformation can be likened to a college graduation; glorification can be likened to the graduation ceremony. If a person does not grow and is not transformed, when the Lord comes back, it will be impossible for him to be transformed instantly to arrive at conformation and glorification. Hence, conformation is the consummation of our transformation in life as well as the preparation before the transfiguration and glorification of our body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. IN GLORIFYING THE BELIEVERS</H2><P>The union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of man is seen consummately in the glorifying of the believers (Rom. 8:30, 23; Eph. 4:30; Col. 3:4b; 1 Pet. 5:10a; 2 Tim. 2:10; Heb. 2:10). The work of the Spirit of God in glorifying the believers begins with His regenerating the believers with the life of God's glory. After regenerating the believers, the Spirit of God continues, step by step, with His work of sanctifying, renewing, transforming, and conforming to transfuse the believers with the Triune God Himself as glory, until the glory of God's life saturates the believers and is manifested in their body. Thus the work of the Spirit of God in glorifying the believers reaches its ultimate consummation. The consummation of this work is to make man God in life and nature, with no share in His Godhead.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VIII. THE ABOVE SIX STEPS<br>ARE ACCOMPLISHED BY THE JOINING OF<br>"THE SPIRIT WITH OUR SPIRIT" AS "ONE SPIRIT"</H2><P>The above six steps are accomplished by the joining of "the Spirit with our spirit" (Rom. 8:16) as "one spirit" (1 Cor. 6:17). If this were not so, even though the gospel of God is "powerful" (Rom. 1:16), it still would not have any power or accomplish anything in the believers. Only through the union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of man in these six steps can the transforming work of making man God be fully accomplished.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE ISSUE OF THE UNION<br>OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD AND<br>THE SPIRIT OF THE BELIEVERS</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:3-6</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The issue of the union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of the believers is the building up of the Body of Christ.</li><li>The building up of the Body of Christ is not of human work, nor is it the forming together of a group of people by man's natural way; hence, it has absolutely nothing to do with man's work, effort, ways, ideas, moral teachings, philosophy, or any religious system or activities.</li><li>The building up of the Body of Christ is the constitution, in the aforementioned two spirits, of the processed and consummated Triune God with a group of tripartite men whom He has redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, renewed, transformed, and conformed to His image.</li><li>This constitution is constituted with:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The believers who are redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, renewed, and transformed by God as its outward framework.</li>	<li>The processed and consummated Triune God as its inward element:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The Father of the Triune God is the source of the inward element.</li>		<li>The Son of the Triune God is the inward element itself.</li>		<li>The Spirit of the Triune God is the essence of the inward element&#151;Eph. 4:4-6.</li>		<li>All three are dispensed, transfused, and built into God's redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, renewed, and transformed believers.</li>		<li>That they and the redeeming and transforming God may be constituted into one entity as the organic Body of Christ, being God yet man and man yet God&#151;Eph. 4:3-4a.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Such a constitution of divinity with humanity is uniquely one in the universe; it should not and cannot be divided.</li>	</ol></li><li>This constitution is the union and mingling of God and man: divinity constituted into humanity to be man's dwelling place and humanity built into divinity to be God's dwelling place.</li><li>This is the harvest of the Triune God's selection in eternity and of the works of His old creation, redemption, and new creation in time.</li><li>In such a great achievement, the operating Triune God is the Benefactor, and the tripartite men who respond to His operation are the beneficiaries; both are also the satisfied enjoyers.</li><li>This is God's eternal heart's desire and His ultimate purpose; this is also something that the tripartite men can never think of nor hope and ask for.</li><li>This is the Triune God's anticipated multiplication and His expected increase.</li><li>This is something beyond the imagination of all the religionists and philosophers, yet we who are graced by God can actually taste it and participate in it for eternity.</li></ol><P>Prayer: Lord, we worship You from deep within. In this meeting it is not man speaking human words but God speaking the words of God. Hence, Lord, we need You. We are men. How can men listen to God's words? We are men. How can we men understand the words of God? Both our listening and our understanding depend on You. Lord, we thank You that You have made us gods. Today we are no longer merely men; we are God-men. Therefore, we have the qualification and the capacity to listen to and understand the word of God. We are gods able to listen to the word of God. We are also gods learning to speak the word of God. Lord, cleanse us and cover us. The release of this word is really hated by the enemy. Lord, may You fight for us because You are the Overcomer; You have already overcome the enemy. The cross has already dealt with the enemy. This is the place where God is speaking to the gods. It is also the place where we know the God-man in the word of God. Lord, the time has come. May You glorify Yourself. Amen.</P><P>In the previous three chapters we have seen the Spirit of God, the spirit of man, and also the union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of man. In this chapter we will see the issue of the union of these two spirits.</P><P>In eternity God is without beginning and without ending, and He is ever unchanging. After He created the heavens, the earth, and man, for a period of four thousand years He did many things, but these things had nothing to do with the accomplishing of His economy. Hence, in the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament, from Genesis to Malachi, what is recorded are superficial matters that are on the surface. This is like the fig tree that had only leaves and was fruitless, on which the Lord Jesus could not find any fruit (Matt. 21:18-19). Nevertheless, when we come to the New Testament, things are no longer superficial, just on the surface; the New Testament is full of fruit.</P><P>The Bible has been in the believers' hands for many years, but not many really know the Bible. Even if there are some who profess to know the Bible, I am afraid that their understanding of the Bible is superficial, just on the surface. For many years I have had a hidden concern as to whether or not the saints have taken in the messages released by the Lord in our midst. Thank the Lord that there are at least some who have taken them in. The Lord has gained some people who are skilled in the word of God. In this conference I am really rejoicing and happy to see that although they have come from different places, all the brothers and sisters prophesy with the same "tone" and speak the same words to present very clearly what the Lord has revealed to us. This is what the enemy cannot annul.</P><P>The Lord's work does not take account of the outward number of people, but of how many are actually saturated by the truths and have become mingled with the truths. Concerning myself, although I am not highly educated, I have slowly advanced. Some are more capable and better educated than I, yet they do not see much of the revelation in the Bible. For many years, by the Lord's mercy, I may say that I have seen much in the Lord's Word. I have advanced slowly, step by step. Consider the Life-studies as an example. Over the past twenty-one years, every six months, under the blessing of the Lord whom I serve, I have covered all sixty-six books of the Bible except Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs. The Lord's blood cover me; this is not my boasting or bragging. I am boasting of the Lord, exalting the Lord Himself. I have nothing, I can do nothing, and I am nothing. I am altogether not; only the Lord is. This is not all that the Lord has; He will speak still more among us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE ISSUE OF THE UNION OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD AND THE SPIRIT OF THE BELIEVERS IS<br>THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</H2><P>Now we need to see the issue of the union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of the believers. We have already seen the union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of man in the six great matters of regeneration, sanctification, renewing, transformation, conformation, and glorification. God is united with us to regenerate, sanctify, renew, transform, conform, and eventually glorify us that we may be the same as God in life and nature, without sharing in His Godhead. These six matters&#151;regeneration, sanctification, renewing, transformation, conformation, and glorification&#151;are the cream and crystallization of my more than sixty years of studying the Bible. All of you, whether you are elders, co-workers, or ordinary brothers and sisters, must study the union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of man in these six matters. The issue of this union is the building up of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST<br>IS NOT OF HUMAN WORK, NOR IS IT<br>THE FORMING TOGETHER OF A GROUP<br>OF PEOPLE BY MAN'S NATURAL WAY</H2><P>According to Ephesians chapter four, the issue of the union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of the believers is the building up of the Body of Christ. This building is not of human work, nor is it a forming together of a group of people by man's natural way. Hence, it has nothing to do with man's work, effort, ways, ideas, moral teachings, philosophy, or any religious system or activities. God's eternal economy is to obtain the Body of Christ. Any work outside of this is not on the central lane of God's eternal economy.</P><P>Most of the work in today's Christianity is human work, is natural, and has nothing to do with the building up of the Body of Christ. Some people may say that Christianity also preaches the gospel and saves sinners. However, preaching the gospel and saving sinners are not simple matters; they involve many important matters. Christianity preaches the gospel by human work, human effort, human doing; but Paul preached the gospel by supplying the person being saved by him with the Spirit of God, so that within him he might have God, the life of God, and also Christ. After that, Paul immediately told the person that his first life had already been crucified with Christ; now he needed to be buried, which is to be baptized. Not only so, Paul also told him that he was already resurrected with Christ, and his every move and action needed to have the newness of life (Rom. 6:4). Nevertheless, today people's preaching of the gospel and saving of sinners are not like Paul's. Today in their preaching of the gospel, people preach mainly that man must have something to rely on, that man must have religion, and that among the many religions, the best is Christianity. They also preach that Christians living on the earth have consolation and hope, and that after they die they will go to heaven. The religionists like to go to heaven, but our God likes to tabernacle among men on the earth (John 1:14; Rev. 21:3). At the end of the Bible we are told that the New Jerusalem will descend from heaven to the earth (Rev. 21:2). Hence, we can see that what Christianity preaches today is according to man's thought, morality, and philosophy and differs greatly from what Paul preached. The gospel that Paul preached was according to the revelation of God for the building up of the Body of Christ. We are not merely preaching the gospel and saving sinners; we are saving sinners to become members of Christ, living members of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST<br>IS THE CONSTITUTION, IN THE AFOREMENTIONED<br>TWO SPIRITS, OF THE PROCESSED AND CONSUMMATED TRIUNE GOD WITH A GROUP OF TRIPARTITE MEN WHOM HE HAS REDEEMED, REGENERATED, SANCTIFIED, RENEWED, TRANSFORMED,<br>AND CONFORMED TO HIS IMAGE</H2><P>In the first eight chapters of Romans, Paul told us that once a person believes in the Lord, he is justified by God (Rom. 3:24); after he is justified, he is sanctified (6:19, 22); and after he is sanctified, he lives in Christ (8:1). In chapter twelve Paul said that all those who live in Christ are members of Christ. All the members combined are the Body of Christ (vv. 4-5). This Body of Christ is God's ultimate desire. The building up of the Body of Christ is a constitution, in the two spirits, the Spirit of God and the spirit of man, of the processed and consummated Triune God with the tripartite men whom He has redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, renewed, transformed, and conformed to His image.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE CONSTITUTION OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Being Constituted with the Believers<br>Who Are Redeemed, Regenerated, Sanctified, Renewed, and Transformed by God<br>as Its Outward Framework</H2><P>The Body of Christ is the constitution of the processed Triune God with the transformed human beings. It is constituted by the union of God and man. The Triune God has passed through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. The Body of Christ is the constitution of such a processed God with His redeemed people. This constitution has the believers who are redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, renewed, and transformed by God as its outward framework. In other words, the constitution of such a building of God and man has man as its outward framework. However, it is not ordinary men who are the framework, but the believers whom God has redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, renewed, and transformed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Also Having the Processed and Consummated Triune God as Its Inward Element</H2><P>The constitution of the Body of Christ has not only the believers whom God has redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, renewed, and transformed, as its outward framework, but has also the processed and consummated Triune God as its inward element. Our human body has an outward framework and an inward element. The outward framework plus the inward element are a living and organic body. It is the same with the Body of Christ. The redeemed people are the outward framework; the redeeming God is the inward element.</P><P>The Father of the Triune God is the source of the inward element of the constitution of the Body of Christ. The Son of the Triune God is the inward element itself. The Spirit of the Triune God is the essence of the inward element. From Ephesians 4:4-6 we can see the source, element, and essence of the Body of Christ. Verse 4 speaks of one Body and one Spirit, verse 5, of one Lord, and verse 6, of one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all. The one Body is the framework; the inward element is the Father as the source, the Son as the element from the Father, and the Spirit as the essence of the element. The Body of Christ is constituted with the Triune God and His redeemed people, with His redeemed people as the outward framework and the Triune God Himself as the inward element.</P><P>Most Christians today do not speak concerning the Body of Christ. Even if they do, they do not speak of it very clearly. Even among us, our way of presentation in the past has not been very clear. We commonly say that the Body of Christ is universal, whereas the church is local. However, the Body of Christ is not a matter of being universal or local, but a matter of the outward framework and the inward element. If there were only the outward framework without the inward element, the Body would be a dead corpse. With the outward framework, there must also be the inward element; then it is a living and organic Body. Today God has made those whom He redeemed, regenerated, and transformed to be the outward framework. God Himself, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, is the inward element. The Father is the source, the Son is the element, and the Spirit is the essence. These four&#151;the Father, the Son, the Spirit, and man&#151;blended and built together become the Body of Christ.</P><P>We all need to see what the Body of Christ is. The Body of Christ is not the totality of all the churches added together.  Verses 3 through 6 in Ephesians 4 first speak of the basic nature of the Body, with the redeemed people as the outward framework and the redeeming God as the inward element. Verses 7 through 16 speak of the building up of this Body. The Body of Christ is similar to the human body. It is not produced by assembling pieces together as in the building of a  house. A house is built by first laying the foundation, then setting up the frame, and then putting pieces of stone on the frame. But our body is not like that. As soon as a person is born, he possesses a complete set of members. What is needed is growth. I often use my grandson as an illustration. When he was born, he weighed only six pounds and was kept in an incubator. However, because he received proper nourishment, today he is not only grown up but has also become very strong. Hence, the building up of the Body is through feeding. When the Body receives the feeding, it will grow gradually; this growth is the building up of the Body.</P><P>The Body is not built up from the outside, but it is grown up from the inside. Growth comes from birth. First there must be birth before there can be growth. Hence, the first step in the producing of the Body of Christ is our regeneration. From God's viewpoint, we were all regenerated through the resurrection of the Lord Jesus on the day of His resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3). Although many individual believers were brought forth, in God's eyes they are a corporate Body. After the regeneration of the many believers in the resurrection of Christ, what follows in sanctification, renewing, transformation, and conformation is a matter of nourishment.</P><P>When the Spirit of God regenerates people from within, it is not He Himself who preaches the gospel directly to men to regenerate them. For people to be regenerated, you and I must go to knock on their doors and speak to them. When we speak to people, we must also have a certain skill, like that of a nurse who goes to someone's home to give him an injection. It does not depend on much speaking but on whether you can inject the person at an appropriate time. In our speaking with people, we need to supply people with the riches of Christ at an appropriate time so that the spirit within them becomes operative, that the unsaved ones may be regenerated and the saved ones may be enlightened. The building up of the Body of Christ hinges on this kind of supply in the spirit. Through the mutual supply in the spirit the members of Christ grow together, resulting in the building up of the Body of Christ.</P><P>The building up of the Body of Christ is the growing up of the Body of Christ. Ephesians 4:13 shows us that this growth requires that everyone arrive at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. Verse 15 says that we need to grow up into Christ, the Head, in all things. Verse 16 says that the Body will grow gradually unto the building up of itself in love. The growth is the building up. Today, generally speaking, Christianity lacks feeding; hence, it also lacks the growth. This is the reason that there is no building up of the Body of Christ.</P><P>The building up of the Body of Christ is the issue of the union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of man. It is a constitution in these two spirits. This constitution, this building, has the saved people as its framework and the saving God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;as its inward element. All three, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, are dispensed, transfused, and built into God's redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, renewed, and transformed believers. This dispensing within us is a daily matter. The Triune God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;is dispensed and transfused into us day by day and thereby is built into us day by day. This is similar to the foods that we eat. Through digestion, the nutrients of the foods are dispensed into us and transfused into our whole being, and are even built into us to become our element, even to become us. Similarly, the Triune God through His dispensing, transfusing, and building becomes us and is built up together with us. Thus we are growing gradually for the accomplishing of the building up of the Body of Christ.</P><P>The Triune God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;is dispensing, transfusing, and building Himself into the believers whom He has redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, renewed, and transformed, so that they and the God who redeemed and transformed them can be constituted into a corporate entity, which is the organic Body of Christ. This entity is God yet man, man yet God (Eph. 4:3-4a). This constitution of divinity and humanity is unique in the universe. It should not be divided and cannot be divided.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. THIS CONSTITUTION IS THE UNION<br>AND MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN</H2><P>The building up of the Body of Christ is the constitution of the Triune God and the tripartite man in the Spirit of God and the spirit of man. This constitution is the union and mingling of God and man. It is divinity constituted into humanity to be man's dwelling place, and it is humanity built into divinity to be God's dwelling place.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THIS IS THE HARVEST OF THE TRIUNE GOD'S SELECTION IN ETERNITY AND OF THE WORKS<br>OF HIS OLD CREATION, REDEMPTION,<br>AND NEW CREATION IN TIME</H2><P>What was presented above is the harvest of the Triune God's selection in eternity and of the works of the old creation, redemption, and new creation in time. All these works of God in eternity and in time result in the building up of the Body of Christ. This is His harvest.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. IN SUCH A GREAT ACHIEVEMENT, GOD IS<br>THE BENEFACTOR AND MEN ARE THE BENEFICIARIES</H2><P>In such a great achievement, the operating Triune God is the Benefactor, and the tripartite men who respond to His operation are the beneficiaries. One is the Benefactor while the others are the beneficiaries. Both are also the satisfied enjoyers. God enjoys man, and man enjoys God. How wonderful this is!</P><P>In conclusion, the Body of Christ is the Triune God's eternal heart's desire and His ultimate purpose. It is also something that the tripartite men can never think of nor hope and ask for. However, this is the Triune God's anticipated multiplication and His expected increase. This multiplication and increase are God and Christ multiplying and increasing within us, the redeemed people. This is something beyond the imagination of all the religionists and philosophers, yet we who have been graced by God can actually taste it and participate in it for eternity.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THROUGH THE CO-LIVING<br>AND CO-WALKING OF THE TWO<br>SPIRITS IN THE BELIEVERS</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:16</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The union and mingling of the Spirit of God with the spirit of man produces a building of the living and walking together of God with man:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Such a building requires the participating God, in His resurrected and uplifted humanity, to co-live and co-walk with the participating men.</li>	<li>Such a building also requires the participating men, in their redeemed and resurrected humanity, to experience the co-death with Christ so that the attributes of the participating God can be manifested from within the participating men in resurrection to be their virtues.</li>	</ol></li><li>This is the living which a God-man conformed to the image of God's firstborn Son should have in experiencing the co-death and co-resurrection with Christ.</li><li>This is also the building up of the Body of Christ arrived at by all the God-men as the members of Christ in their growing up into the Head, Christ, in all things:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Out from the Head, Christ, all the Body is joined together through every joint of the rich supply&#151;Eph. 4:16a.</li>	<li>Out from the Head, Christ, all the Body is also knit together (interwoven) through the operation in the measure of each one part&#151;Eph. 4:16b.</li>	<li>Causing the growth of the Body of Christ unto the building up of itself in love&#151;Eph. 4:16c.</li>	<li>The growth in Christ of the many God-men as the members of Christ is the building up of the Body of Christ.</li>	<li>Such a building up of the Body of Christ is formed by organic growth, not organized by human work.</li>	</ol></li></ol><P>Prayer: Lord, we really love You; we also love Your word and Your speaking. We are sitting quietly before You to listen to Your speaking again. Lord, please speak. We want to be here listening to God speaking the word of God. Amen!</P><P>In the previous chapter, based on Ephesians 4:4-6, we considered the constitution of the Body of Christ. Here I would ask you to read again that passage of the Scripture: "One Body and one Spirit, even as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all." These three verses are the most mysterious and most excellent portion in the Bible that speaks forth the heart's desire of the Triune God and the highest purpose He desires to attain. It is based on such a portion of the Word that we say that the building up of the Body of Christ is the constitution of the processed and consummated Triune God with the tripartite men whom He has redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, renewed, transformed, conformed to His image, and glorified. It is also based on this portion that we say that the Body of Christ is the union and mingling of God and His redeemed people. The Body of Christ is not merely a constitution but also a union and a mingling. Now I want to ask a few questions to help you see the crucial points revealed in these few verses.</P><P>First, from this portion of the Bible, how can we prove that the people redeemed by God are the outward framework of the Body of Christ? Verse 4 begins with "one Body," not with "one Spirit." Here the Body is mentioned before the Spirit because when we look at a person, we first see his outward body. The fact that verse 4 begins with "one Body" proves that this Body is the outward framework of its inward element covered in the succeeding verses.</P><P>Second, how can we prove that the Triune God is within this outward framework to be its content? Verse 6 says, "One God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all." The Divine Trinity is implied here. Over all refers mainly to the Father, through all, to the Son, and in all, to the Spirit. The Father is the source, the Son is the element, and the Spirit is the essence. All three are within the outward framework of the Body of Christ to be its content. This is indicated by in all.</P><P>Third, how can we prove that in the Body of Christ the redeemed people become the new creation in the Triune God? This can be proved by one faith in verse 5. Through faith we believe into Christ (John 3:16), that is, into the Christ who is the embodiment of the Triune God. Hence, in the Body of Christ the redeemed people are in Christ, in the Triune God. Moreover, 2 Corinthians 5:17 says, "So then if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation." Hence, in the Body of Christ, since the redeemed people are in Christ, they are a new creation. The redeemed people as the outward framework of the Body of Christ have become the new creation in the Triune God.</P><P>Fourth, how can we prove that in the Body of Christ the old man and the old creation of the redeemed people have already been fully terminated? One baptism in verse 5 is a proof of this matter. Baptism is a burial; it is also a termination. Through baptism the old man and the old creation of the redeemed people are terminated. Hence, in the Body of Christ there is no old man and no old creation. In order to have the reality of the Body of Christ, we must experience the termination of the old man and the old creation. If we still have a little of the old creation, we do not have the reality of the Body of Christ. We need to live a crucified life, experience the termination of the old man, and live out Christ, who possesses both the divine nature and the human nature. Then we will have the reality of the Body of Christ.</P><P>Fifth, how can we prove that the Spirit as the essence of the Body of Christ is connected to the redeemed people's hope of the glorification of their body? Concerning this point, verse 4 says, "One Body and one Spirit, even as also you were called in one hope of your calling." Our future hope is that our body will enter into glory, that is, the redemption of our body (Rom. 8:23-25). Ephesians 4:30 says, "...the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption [of the body]." To be sealed is to receive the Holy Spirit as the essence (Eph. 1:13). The ultimate issue of this is the redemption of the body, that is, glorification (Rom. 8:21, 23). Hence Ephesians chapter four joins the Spirit as the essence with the hope of glorification. A hope seems to be very far away, but the Spirit as the essence is so near to us and cannot be nearer. The glory that we will obtain is within us today. The essence is already within us. One day it will be manifested, and that will be our glorification.</P><P>This is like a seed sown into the earth. First it puts forth sprouts, and then it grows leaves and blossoms. To blossom is to be glorified. The glory of the flower comes from the essence of the seed, and the expression of the essence within the seed is the maturity of the essence within the seed. Today there is an essence within us. This essence will "blossom" in the future. That will be our glorification. Hence, the "one Spirit...one hope" mentioned in Ephesians 4:4 can be referred to as "one essence, one glorification."</P><P>Many saved ones have experienced the Spirit within them as the essence. For example, before they were saved, the young sisters dressed themselves according to their own preference. After they are saved, even as they comb their hair, there is One within them asking, "Is it right to comb your hair in this way?" Some go to the movie theaters. They also experience One within them following them and saying to them, "Go back." These are very shallow illustrations to show us that we have a most precious thing within us. It entered when we were saved, and it will never leave us. This is the Spirit within us as the essence. The Spirit as the essence is like the essence within the seed. One day it will "bud" and "blossom." That will be our glorification.</P><P>Sixth, how can we prove that in the Body of Christ the outward framework and the inward content are joined and mingled together to be one? Ephesians 4:4-6 mentions that the Spirit as the essence within us is joined to the hope of glory. It also mentions our being put into Christ through the one faith and the one baptism, and also that the one God and Father is over all, through all, and in all. Hence, the Triune God is in us and we are in Him. This is the joining and mingling of the outward framework and the inward content so that they become one.</P><P>Now we need to go one step further to see how the building up of the Body of Christ is carried out through the co-living and co-walking of the Spirit of God with the spirit of man in the believers. The title of this chapter is "Through the Co-living and Co-walking of the Two Spirits in the Believers." This continues the previous chapter, which says that the issue of the union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of man is the building up of the Body of Christ. The building up of this Body is carried out through the co-living and co-walking of the two spirits in the believers, which is presented in this chapter. Hence, these two chapters are connected.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE UNION AND MINGLING OF<br>THE SPIRIT OF GOD WITH THE SPIRIT OF MAN PRODUCES A BUILDING OF THE LIVING AND<br>WALKING TOGETHER OF GOD WITH MAN</H2><P>The union and mingling of the Spirit of God with the spirit of man produces a building of the living and walking together of God with man. Romans 8:16 says, "The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit..." The witnessing here is done by two parties acting together: the Spirit with our spirit. Hence, the verb witnesses implies a living and walking together. This verse appears to be simple and easy to understand, but it speaks of two spirits, that is, the Spirit and our spirit, and of the living and walking together of these two spirits. The co-living and co-walking of these two spirits in the believers is the means for the building up of the Body of Christ.</P><P>The Christian life is a grafted life, not an exchanged life. Some in Christianity take the phrase it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ in Galatians 2:20 as the basis for describing the Christian life as an exchanged life. But Paul's word says, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God," that is, by union and mingling with Him. If we pay attention only to no longer I, but Christ, it may appear that this speaks of an exchange. Yet in actuality, no longer I does not mean that there is no more "I," because the verse goes on to say that it is Christ who lives in "me." Moreover, "I" still live in the flesh. Hence, this is not an exchanged life but a grafted life. When two trees are grafted together, it does not mean that one tree takes the place of the other tree, and the other does not live any longer. Rather, it means that the lives of these two trees have been grafted to become one life. The respective elements of the two trees still remain; however, the two trees have become one tree and bring forth fruit that is a mingled fruit.</P><P>In Galatians 2:20, the "I" in it is no longer I is the old "I" in Adam. The "me" in it is Christ who lives in me is the new "me" produced through death and resurrection in Christ. Moreover, Paul says, "And the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God," that is, by union and mingling with Him. Previously, he said that " `Christ' lives in me," but here he speaks of "the life which `I' now live." Hence, it is not one person living but two persons living together. This is not an exchanged life but a grafted life. It is two lives becoming one life, two livings becoming one living, two results becoming one result. This is what A. B. Simpson wrote in one of his hymns, which speaks of being crucified with Christ and risen with Christ (Hymns, #482). We not only die with Christ but also live with Christ. It is not that Christ lives and I do not live in order that my life may be exchanged for His, but that I and Christ live together, as in grafting. Stanza three of this hymn says, "A poor tree with better grafted,/Richer, sweeter life doth gain." In nature the good branch is always grafted into the poor tree, but the biblical way is contrary to this. Romans chapter eleven says that the wild olive tree (the poor tree) is grafted into the cultivated olive tree (the better tree) (vv. 17, 24). Likewise we, the poor branches, are grafted into Christ to become the branches of Christ as the true vine (Rom. 6:5; John 15:5), to live with Him and enjoy all His riches.</P><P>Today we, the God-men, are those who have both the human nature and the divine nature. We have within us two lives and two natures. These two lives and two natures are living together. This thought is expressed in a new hymn, which says, "No longer I alone that live,/But God together lives with me." The building up of the Body of Christ is the issue of this kind of co-living. The building up of the Body of Christ is not a work but a co-living. It is not something that is worked out but something that is lived out. When two trees are grafted together, they both grow and live together to eventually bring forth fruit. This fruit is not produced by building or making but by growing. Hence, the building of the Body of Christ is something that comes out of growth. The building up of the Body of Christ is the growth itself.</P><P>Actually, a Christian is not single-natured but dual-natured. Christ has divinity and humanity; He is God yet man, God plus man. A Christian has humanity and divinity; he is man yet God, man plus God. Hence, from the beginning Brother Nee did not agree to translate the word Christian into Chinese as "Christ-disciple." He said that we should translate it as "Christ-man." A Christ-man is one who has both the divine nature and the human nature, one who is a man yet has two natures. We are a dual-natured entity&#151;man yet God; hence, we are God-men. Since we are God-men, our living is not merely the living of God but also the living of human beings; it is not merely the living of human beings but also the living of God.</P><P>The redeemed people in the Body of Christ are those who are regenerated to be man yet God. We who are regenerated by God will become God. Some people do not agree with this kind of speaking. However, I must say that once a person believes in the Lord Jesus, He is regenerated, born of God. God is his Father. Since the Father is God, the children also should be God. Sheep beget sheep; horses beget horses. Of course, God begets God. John 1:12-13 says, "But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name, who were begotten...of God." This word strongly indicates that the believers of the Lord are God's children, who are born of God. What is born of God is God. Perhaps there are some who say that although we are born of God, we are still men. To this I must say that although the Lord Jesus is God who became a man, He is still God. Although we are men who become God, we are still men. The Lord Jesus is God who became a man, but He did not lose His divinity; He is still God, and hence, He is God yet man. Today we, the saved ones, are men who become God, but we have not discarded our human nature; we are still men, and hence, we are man yet God. This is the fact and the truth, and it is logical.</P><P>We, the saved ones, are not merely forgiven of our sins; we are regenerated. To be regenerated is to be born a second time. Our first birth was of our parents, who are humans; hence, we also are humans. Today we are regenerated, born of God the Father; hence, we also are God. Our second birth was of God. Since we are born of God, surely we are the children of God. The children of God surely are God. By our first birth we became man; by our second birth we become God. If a person in his second birth is still only a man, he has not been regenerated. In our second birth we are born of God, and what is born of God surely is God. Hence, today we are not merely men but men yet God. We are children of men, and also children of God. A man has begotten me; thus, I am a man. God has begotten me; thus, I am God. By our two births we have become men yet God. This is irrefutable.</P><P>I have been stressing the fact that we are men yet God because this has too much to do with our living. For example, the children of a president are prudent in their speech and careful in their actions because they recognize their status. A person who is born of God should not forget his status as a son of God. If we have really seen this matter, there will always be a reminder within us: "Would a son of God speak in this way? Would he dress in this way?" No one who really recognizes that he is a son of God could ever live and act by his own desires. I can testify that when I went to a department store, each time I picked up a necktie, there was a reminder within me saying, "I am a child of God who speaks for the Lord. Can I use this tie?" Often I just put down the necktie because I knew that I could not use it. Brothers and sisters, do not forget your status. If the prince of a royal family forgot his status, that would be very unfortunate. Since we are men yet God, our living should match our status. We must live the life of one who is man yet God.</P><P>Only when we live the life of one who is man yet God can the Body of Christ be built up. We should never think that the Body of Christ is worked out by man's labor; neither should we think that the Body of Christ can be built up by good behavior. The building up of the Body of Christ depends on the living that is the mingling of two natures&#151;the divine nature and the human nature&#151;that is, the co-living of two parties&#151;the One who is God yet man and those who are man yet God&#151;blended together as one. This kind of joined and mingled living will cause the Body of Christ to be built up.</P><P>In other words, the building up of the Body of Christ is the issue of the co-living and co-walking of God and man through the union and mingling of the Spirit of God with the spirit of man. In actuality, this kind of co-living and co-walking is the building up of the Body of Christ. On the one hand, this kind of building requires the participating God, in His resurrected and uplifted humanity, to co-live and co-walk with the participating men. On the other hand, this kind of building also requires the participating men, in their redeemed and resurrected humanity, to experience the co-death with Christ so that the attributes of the participating God can be manifested from within the participating men in resurrection to be their virtues.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THIS IS THE LIVING WHICH A GOD-MAN CONFORMED TO THE IMAGE OF GOD'S FIRSTBORN SON SHOULD HAVE IN EXPERIENCING THE CO-DEATH<br>AND CO-RESURRECTION WITH CHRIST</H2><P>The union and mingling of the Spirit of God with the spirit of man produce this kind of building of the co-living and co-walking of God and man, which is the living that a God-man conformed to the image of God's firstborn Son should have in experiencing the co-death and co-resurrection with Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THIS IS ALSO THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY<br>OF CHRIST ARRIVED AT BY ALL THE GOD-MEN<br>AS THE MEMBERS OF CHRIST IN THEIR GROWING UP INTO THE HEAD, CHRIST, IN ALL THINGS</H2><P>The building up of the Body of Christ is through the co-living and co-walking of the two spirits in the believers. This is also the building up of the Body of Christ arrived at by all the God-men as the members of Christ in their growing up into the Head, Christ, in all things (Eph. 4:15). To grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things implies that in every point and every aspect of our daily life, Christ is increasing within us. To grow up into Christ is to allow Christ to grow and increase in all our inward parts. When He grows, we will enter more into Him. Thus, the members of Christ will grow by the growth of Christ and eventually arrive at the building up of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Out from the Head, Christ,<br>All the Body Is Joined Together through<br>Every Joint of the Rich Supply</H2><P>Those members who grow up into the Head, Christ, will be "out from" the Head, Christ. If we do not grow up into the Head, Christ, there is no way for us to be "out from" Him. First, we grow up into the Head, Christ; then we have something that is out from the Head for the building of His Body. This is why Ephesians 4:15 speaks of growing up into the Head, Christ, and then is followed by verse 16, which speaks of being "out from" Him. Out from Him, all the Body is joined together through every joint of the rich supply (Eph. 4:16a). The rich supply here must be a particular supply, the supply of Christ. The joints of the rich supply refer to the specially gifted persons, as mentioned in verse 11, who are the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. In the Body of Christ there is the need for these joints of the rich supply to join all the parts together. Thus the Body of Christ will be built up.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Out from the Head, Christ, All the Body<br>Is Also Knit Together (Interwoven) through<br>the Operation in the Measure of Each One Part</H2><P>Out from the Head, Christ, all the Body is also knit together through the operation in the measure of each one part (Eph. 4:16b). Each one part refers to each member of the Body. Through the growth in life and the development of the gift, each member of the Body of Christ has its own measure, which operates for the growth of the Body. When the various parts of the Body operate appropriately, all the Body will be knit together, that is, interwoven.</P><P>The Body of Christ has joints and various parts. The joints are for connecting; the various parts are for knitting together (interweaving). To be joined and knit together, or interwoven, is to be built up together. For example, every building has its framework and its various parts. The framework needs to be joined together; the various parts need to be knit together. The framework is just an empty frame; there are many holes that need to be filled and knit together by the knitting work of every part between the holes, as in weaving textiles. This kind of building by joining and knitting is very strong and sturdy. Ephesians 4:16 uses the words joined and knit, which surely have two implications: one is the joining of the framework, and the other is the knitting, the interweaving, of the various parts. The Body of Christ can be built up by the joining and knitting together through the supplying joints and the various functioning parts.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Causing the Growth of the Body of Christ<br>unto the Building Up of Itself in Love</H2><P>The Body of Christ is joined together through every joint of the rich supply and knit together (interwoven) through the operation in the measure of each one part. This joining and knitting causes the gradual growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love (Eph. 4:16c). The building up of the Body of Christ is in love. When all the members love one another, the Body of Christ can be built up.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Growth in Christ of the Many God-men<br>as the Members of Christ<br>Is the Building Up of the Body of Christ</H2><P>The growth in Christ of the many God-men as the members of Christ is the building up of the Body of Christ. In the Body of Christ, the growth of the many God-men as the members is the building. The growth is the building. The real building is the growth in the life of God. The growth of the Body of Christ is the increase of Christ in the many members, resulting in the Body of Christ building itself up.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Such a Building Up of the Body of Christ<br>Is Formed by Organic Growth,<br>Not Organized by Human Work</H2><P>Such a building up of the Body of Christ is formed by organic growth, not organized by human work. All those who are not in life, not walking according to the union of the two spirits, are not in the building up of the Body of Christ. We need to see this vision clearly. The Body of Christ is absolutely not built up by using man's natural methods or the organization of human work. The building up of the Body of Christ can be attained only through the co-living and co-walking of the Spirit of God with the spirit of man in the believers in their experience of the co-death and co-resurrection with Christ and their growing up into the Head, Christ, in all things. The Body of Christ, which is altogether organic, does not allow anything of human work. We need to see this vision clearly so that we can build up the Body of Christ organically. Today there are people who argue by saying that a local church is independent; a local church should not interfere with another local church. They say that after an apostle has established the church, he should not interfere with that church anymore. All such people are short of revelation and vision; they have not seen the truth. If you are one who fears the Lord, after you have read the outline of this chapter thoroughly, you surely will be moved to worship and be still. Every word of this speaking is taken from Ephesians chapter four. The Bible has sixty-six books, yet there is not one book or one chapter that is so mysterious and organic in speaking about the building up of the Body of Christ as Ephesians chapter four. All the points in this outline are pearls and precious stones of the Bible. I put these together and compiled them into writing. This is what we call "crystallization." I hope that you can all get into the crystallization of these truths.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE THREE ASPECTS<br>OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 1:4b; Eph. 1:10; 3:9; John 14:9-20; Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14; Rev. 1:4-5; 1 Cor. 15:45b; John 7:39; Rev. 22:17; John 3:15-16; Eph. 1:22-23; 1 Cor. 10:32; Rom. 6:4-6; Eph. 4:22-24; Phil. 3:10; 1:19-21; Matt. 16:24; Gal. 5:24; Rom. 8:3; Heb. 2:14; John 12:31; Gal. 1:4; Rom. 12:2; 5:17, 21; 1 Tim. 3:15-16; Matt. 16:18-19; Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rev. 1:11; 1 Cor. 1:10-13; 10:16-17; 9:1-3; 1 Tim. 3:1-13; 1:3-4; Rom. 14:17</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The first aspect of the Lord's recovery&#151;the revelation of God:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Concerning the eternal economy of God&#151;1 Tim. 1:4b; Eph. 1:10; 3:9.</li>	<li>Concerning the Divine Trinity&#151;John 14:9-20; Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14; Rev. 1:4-5.</li>	<li>Concerning the person and work of the all-inclusive Christ&#151;Eph. 1:23.</li>	<li>Concerning the consummated life-giving Spirit&#151;1 Cor. 15:45b; John 7:39; Rev. 22:17.</li>	<li>Concerning the eternal life of God&#151;John 3:15-16.</li>	<li>Concerning the Body of Christ, which is the church of God&#151;Eph. 1:22-23; 1 Cor. 10:32.</li>	</ol></li><li>The second aspect of the Lord's recovery&#151;the God-man life:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The life lived out by the believers, who have been regenerated to become God-men, not by the life of their old man but by the divine life in their new man&#151;Rom. 6:4-6; Eph. 4:22-24.</li>	<li>Being conformed daily to the death of Christ by the power of Christ's resurrection and living and magnifying Christ through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ&#151;Phil. 3:10; 1:19-21.</li>	<li>Overcoming the self, the flesh, and the involvements of the flesh&#151;sin, Satan, and the world&#151;Matt. 16:24; Gal. 5:24; Rom. 8:3; Heb. 2:14; John 12:31.</li>	<li>Overcoming religion, culture, and the tide and amusements of this age&#151;Gal. 1:4; Rom. 12:2.</li>	<li>Reigning as kings by the reigning life of Christ to conquer all persons, matters, and things contrary to God and be the overcomers of the Lord in this age&#151;Rom. 5:17, 21; Rev. 2&#151;3.</li>	</ol></li><li>The third aspect of the Lord's recovery&#151;the practice of the church:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The universal Body of Christ being the universal house of God and the kingdom of God as well&#151;Eph. 1:23; 1 Tim. 3:15-16; Matt. 16:18-19.</li>	<li>Appearing in various cities as local churches, with one city having only one church in order to keep the oneness and prevent division (Deut. 12:5-18)&#151; Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rev. 1:4, 11.</li>	<li>The local churches are scattered in different places by geography, yet they are not divided by any doctrine or matter&#151;1 Cor. 1:10-13.</li>	<li>The unique church of God is expressed as many local churches throughout the whole globe, yet they are still the unique universal Body of Christ and should not be divided into sects or denominations&#151;1 Cor. 10:16-17.</li>	<li>Among the churches there are the apostles who set up the churches, and in every church there are also elders who manage the church and deacons who serve the church; however, besides the order of these holy services, there should not be any hierarchy&#151;religious organization or system of rank&#151;1 Cor. 9:1-3; 1 Tim. 3:1-13.</li>	<li>Although the local churches in various localities are many, they all take the eternal economy of God as their center to bear the unique testimony of Christ, not teaching any doctrine that is unrelated to the eternal economy of God and has nothing to do with the testimony of Christ&#151;1 Tim. 1:3-4.</li>	<li>In these local churches there should be righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit as the reality of the kingdom of God&#151;Rom. 14:17.</li>	</ol></li></ol><P>Prayer: Lord, You are the Alpha and You are also the Omega. You are the Beginning and also the End. May You speak to us again until You have completed speaking Your word. When You appeared to Abraham, he waited before You and walked with You, waiting for Your last word, until You had completed Your speaking. O Lord, this is the last meeting. From deep within we are waiting for You to speak to us the final word. The final word is the deciding word, the word most in Your heart. May we here have not only excitement but also an ambition and a great purpose of heart toward You. This is not for ourselves but for Your eternal economy. We want to be Your overcomers in this generation, to walk with You, to live together with You, and to work together with You so that we can terminate this age and bring in the kingdom age. This is what You desire and what You want to obtain. Lord, hear our prayer and take care of us. We are a group of people who need Your mercy. Our condition really needs Your mercy. May You have mercy on us in many ways. Amen.</P><P>In the previous chapters we have seen a number of great and profound matters. In this chapter we will go back to look at the Lord's recovery. The speaking Spirit of the Lord within the minister of His word is most sensitive. He knows what to speak. Within me is a heavy burden. I am concerned that you might have been in the Lord's recovery for many years, yet you still do not know what the Lord's recovery is. Although you may know the Lord's recovery in term, you may not know its real significance.</P><P>From 1933 to 1935 there was a publication among us that reported and fellowshipped concerning the situation of the churches. That publication was called "A Collection of Newsletters." Later the brothers reported and fellowshipped in that publication primarily matters that concerned minor issues, such as leaving the denominations, baptism, head covering, etc., and not much attention was paid to the central messages given by Brother Nee concerning Christ as life and Christ having the preeminence in all things. Because of this, Brother Nee was forced to suspend that publication in 1935 and to tell the co-workers strongly that they needed to be awakened and not continue in that way but have a change. Today I am concerned about the same thing. The Lord has been speaking continuously in His recovery for seventy-three years, from Brother Nee's publication of literature in 1922 up to today. The Lord's speaking among us has never stopped. Today the Lord's speaking has reached the high peak concerning God's economy, which is God becoming man in order to make man God in life and nature. However, does our condition match this? I am afraid that many people take "man becoming God" only as a slogan. This is why we must look specifically at what the Lord's recovery is.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE FIRST ASPECT OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY&#151;<br>THE REVELATION OF GOD</H2><P>Simply, the Lord's recovery has three aspects. The first aspect is the revelation of God. The revelation of God is the speaking of God. From Moses in the Old Testament until the apostle John in the New Testament, God spoke for more than fifteen hundred years. His speaking collectively became the completed Bible, which is in our hands today. Hence, the last book of the Bible, Revelation, says at the end that no one should add to these words or take away from these words (22:18-19).</P><P>Even before the first group of apostles passed away, the church had already veered from the word of God, the revelation of God. This was why the apostles wrote the second Epistles, such as 2 Peter, 2 Timothy, the Epistles of 2 and 3 John, etc. All these second Epistles are books of recovery. The church had lost the truth and had left the position of the truth. The apostles wrote the second Epistles to bring the church back. What they wrote also became a part of the truth, a part of the Bible, to be a warning to the future generations. At that time the church had greatly deviated from the truth. For example, some denied the deity of Christ, saying that Christ was merely an honorable man and that because of His high honor He was later deified. There were also some who said that Christ was not God incarnated as a real man; He was merely a phantom. The first Epistle of John deals with these heretical teachings (2:22; 4:2-3).</P><P>After the first group of apostles, in church history there were the so-called church fathers, who defended the truths. However, among the church fathers, because of inadequate light, there was always much contention concerning the truths. It was not until A.D. 325 that, for the sake of maintaining the order in his empire, the Roman emperor Constantine the Great came forward to intervene by calling a meeting at Nicaea in order to quiet the contentions among the church fathers. At that time there was a young theologian named Athanasius, who was a student under the church fathers. A sentence that he spoke, "God became man that man may become God," shocked everyone, and it has become a famous quote in church history. The Nicene Creed, which he helped to draft, was not bad in presenting the orthodox and fundamental doctrines concerning God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit. It is still used by the Catholic Church and the Protestant churches. Although this creed is good, in terms of the truth it is still very lacking. Hence, the Nicene Council did not completely solve the problems concerning the truths.</P><P>The knowledge concerning the consummated Spirit of the Triune God has been very lacking for centuries. For example, the seventeenth century edition of the King James Version of the Bible still uses the impersonal pronoun it in referring to the Holy Spirit because the translators viewed the Holy Spirit as an instrument to be used by God, and not as a person ranked equally with the other two in the Divine Trinity. Two centuries later, when the British Brethren were raised up by the Lord, they pointed out clearly that the Holy Spirit is a person. This was because the word of the Lord Jesus clearly mentioned "the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit" (Matt. 28:19), and the church fathers long before had acknowledged the Holy Spirit as a person in the Godhead. The English translations after the nineteenth century began gradually to adopt the personal pronoun He in referring to the Holy Spirit.</P><P>In the twentieth century the Lord's recovery has reached us. Beginning with Brother Nee, we have read through the Bible thoroughly. We have especially dug out all the verses in the Bible concerning the Holy Spirit. Concerning the consummated Spirit, the Lord has shown us three crucial points. First, the Spirit of God has been processed to become a life-giving Spirit (John 7:39; 1 Cor. 15:45b). Second, this consummated Spirit is the compound Spirit typified by the holy anointing ointment in the Old Testament (Exo. 30:23-25). Third, this Spirit has also become the seven Spirits (Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6), that is, the sevenfold intensified Spirit. These three points were not mentioned in the Nicene Creed.</P><P>The Lord has caused us to receive much revelation in the Bible. In order for us to present these revelations, we have invented many new terms. An example of a new term invented by us is the processed and consummated Triune God. The church fathers long ago used the term the Triune God. Although this term is not in the Bible, the fact that God is triune is definitely in the Bible. Both processed and consummated are terms that had never been used in the history of Christianity before us. However, no one can deny that God has passed through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, ultimately producing a consummation, that is, the life-giving Spirit.</P><P>Today many Christians have never heard of the processed and consummated God. Hence, what they are preaching is the unprocessed God in Genesis chapter one. However, what we have seen is the consummated God in Revelation chapter twenty-two. At the end the Bible says, "The Spirit and the bride say..." (Rev. 22:17). The Spirit is the processed and consummated God; the bride is the processed and consummated church. The two are joined to be a loving pair in eternity. The final word of the Bible is the highest authority for defining the truth. The Lord in His recovery has already shown us the highest truth defined by the Bible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Concerning the Eternal Economy of God</H2><P>The divine revelation in the Bible is the content of the Lord's recovery. This revelation contains six major items. The first item concerns God's eternal economy (1 Tim. 1:4b; Eph. 1:10; 3:9). God's eternal economy is something that today's theologians overlook, yet it is a very important truth in the New Testament. Briefly, God's economy is God's plan. For this plan, God made an administrative arrangement, which is His administrative management for dispensing Himself through the processed and consummated all-inclusive Spirit into His chosen, regenerated, sanctified, and transformed tripartite men so that they can become God in life and nature yet with no share in His Godhead. Thus they are being constituted to be the Body of Christ and will ultimately be enlarged and built up to be the New Jerusalem as God's eternal and corporate expression.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Concerning the Divine Trinity</H2><P>The second major item in the divine revelation concerns the Divine Trinity (John 14:9-20; Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14; Rev. 1:4-5). Although theologians today also speak of the Trinity, what they speak is not very impressive or complete and is not very scriptural. For the purpose of presenting the truth concerning the Divine Trinity, the Bible expositors invented a number of new terms, such as the economical Trinity, the essential Trinity, etc. God is triune; He has an economical aspect as well as an essential aspect. Although these new terms were not invented by us, because they are quite expressive and meaningful, we also use them.</P><P>What the Lord has shown us in His recovery concerning the Divine Trinity is that the three coexist and coinhere. Although the three are distinct, They cannot be separated. All this is not for doctrinal debate or study but for our experience and enjoyment (2 Cor. 13:14). The Divine Trinity is for the dispensing of God into His chosen people that they may accomplish His eternal economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Concerning the Person and<br>Work of the All-inclusive Christ</H2><P>We have been shown that the third major item in the divine revelation concerns the person and work of the all-inclusive Christ (Eph. 1:23). The Christ who is revealed in the Bible is all-inclusive. Ephesians 1:23 says that Christ is the One who fills all in all. This all-inclusive Christ, as the preeminent One over all things and the One who fills all in all, is the center and circumference of God's economy. By passing through incarnation, thirty-three and a half years of human living, the all-inclusive death, the all-conquering resurrection, and the all-transcending ascension, He dispenses Himself into the believers to regenerate, sanctify, renew, and transform them, and also to conform them to the image of God's firstborn Son, that is, the image of Christ, the first God-man, and ultimately to glorify them with God's eternal glory. They become the many God-men to constitute the Body of Christ, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the enlargement and expression of God in humanity for eternity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Concerning the Consummated<br>Life-giving Spirit</H2><P>The fourth major item in the divine revelation concerns the consummated life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b; John 7:39; Rev. 22:17). The term consummated implies that the Spirit passed through the processes to become a consummated Spirit. Concerning the consummated Spirit, there are three major and crucial points. First, the Spirit of God has been compounded with a number of elements to become a compound Spirit, as typified by the holy anointing ointment in Exodus 30:23-25. Second, John 7:39 and 1 Corinthians 15:45b reveal that before Jesus' resurrection, in which He was glorified, the Spirit of God had not yet been processed to become the Spirit who gives life. It was at the time of His resurrection that Jesus was glorified (Luke 24:26). In His resurrection, Christ, the last Adam in the flesh, became a life-giving Spirit. The life-giving Spirit is also called the Spirit of Jesus (Acts 16:7), the Spirit of Christ&#151;the pneumatic Christ (Rom. 8:9)&#151;the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19), and the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). Third, in Revelation the Spirit of God eventually becomes the seven Spirits, that is, the sevenfold intensified Spirit (1:4; 4:5; 5:6), to enable the believers to overcome the various degradations of the church in the dark age of the church. The Spirit of God, after being compounded, transformed, and intensified, became the consummated Spirit of the Triune God (22:17a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Concerning the Eternal Life of God</H2><P>The fifth major item in the divine revelation concerns the eternal life of God (John 3:15-16). Generally, in the understanding of Christians, eternal life is not a life but a blessedness in the heavens to be enjoyed forever after death. The teachers in Christianity do not give people the proper knowledge concerning the eternal life; instead, they explain the eternal life as a place where the believers go after death to enjoy the good things in the heavens forever. What an error this is!</P><P>Thank the Lord that in the past seventy years He has recovered among us the scriptural view and the proper understanding concerning the eternal life of God. We obtained this eternal life from God through believing in Jesus Christ, the Son of God. This life is the life on the highest plane; it is the divine life of God, even the complete Triune God Himself. It is uncreated, incorruptible, indestructible, and eternal. Eternal implies that in quality, quantity, time, space, and existence, it is perfect and complete. We are regenerated and transformed in this eternal and everlasting, perfect and complete, incorruptible and indestructible, marvelous and wonderful life, and glorified with the consummated Triune God as our eternal glory. This is the eternal life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Concerning the Body of Christ,<br>Which Is the Church of God</H2><P>The sixth major item of the divine revelation in the Bible concerns the Body of Christ, which is the church of God (Eph. 1:22-23; 1 Cor. 10:32). According to the revelation and pattern seen in the New Testament, the church is the gathering of the believers in Christ, who are called out from the world. This gathering, on the one hand, is the house of the living God (1 Tim. 3:15) for God to dwell in to accomplish His will according to His desire for His good pleasure. On the other hand, it is the organic Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23) for Him to have a counterpart that is organically united with Him to be His expression. Such a church as the house of God and also the Body of Christ is unique in the universe, yet it is manifested and expressed in many different localities on the earth to be the many local churches. The fellowship in life of this church, whether universally or locally, is unique.</P><P>I would exhort the brothers and sisters, especially the co-workers and elders, to study thoroughly the revelation of these six major items, and even to widely teach and preach concerning them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE SECOND ASPECT OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY&#151;THE GOD-MAN LIFE</H2><P>Now we come to the second aspect of the Lord's recovery, that is, the God-man life, which is the kind of living that the believers need to have. The worldly people emphasize moral and ethical living and religious living; yet these are not what God wants. What God wants is the God-man life, which is God and man living together. In your family life you should have God living together with you. As a wife, you should have God be the wife with you. As a husband, you should have God be the husband with you. As a co-worker, you should have God be the co-worker with you. Even when you go shopping, you should have God go shopping with you. I have often prayed, "Lord, are You willing to go with me? I have a few words that I want to speak to Brother So-and-so. Lord, will You go with me?" Not living alone but living together with God in this way is the God-man life.</P><P>We are not religionists living a religious life. Neither are we followers of Confucius's teachings or Mencius's thoughts, living a moral and ethical life. We are God-men living a God-man life. The Lord's recovery is to recover this kind of God-man life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Being the Life Lived Out by the Believers,<br>Who Have Been Regenerated to Become<br>God-men, Not by the Life of Their Old Man<br>but by the Divine Life in Their New Man</H2><P>Paul was this kind of person. He said, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me" (Gal. 2:20). We all need to be like Paul in being able to speak such a word. We must be able to boast by saying, "I am a God-man. The life that I am living is a life lived by God and man together; it is God and I living together." This kind of life lived by God and us together is the life lived out of the believers, who have been regenerated to become God-men, not by the life of their old man but by the divine life in their new man (Rom. 6:4-6; Eph. 4:22-24).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Being Conformed Daily to the Death of Christ by the Power of Christ's Resurrection and Living and Magnifying Christ through the Bountiful Supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ</H2><P>The God-man life is also one that is conformed daily to the death of Christ by the power of Christ's resurrection and lives and magnifies Christ through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 3:10; 1:19-21). We have received the power of Christ's resurrection; hence, we can live a crucified life by this power, being conformed to His death. Paul was this kind of person. Not only so, when he was in prison, he lived and magnified Christ by enjoying the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. We also should live this kind of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Overcoming the Self, the Flesh,<br>and the Involvements of the Flesh&#151;<br>Sin, Satan, and the World</H2><P>When Christ was crucified on the cross, He dealt with our old man, our flesh, and the involvements of the flesh&#151;sin, Satan, and the world. We, the God-men, in living the God-man life by the Spirit, can now apply what Christ has accomplished on the cross to overcome the self, the flesh, and the involvements of the flesh&#151;sin, Satan, and the world (Rom. 6:6; Matt. 16:24; Gal. 5:24; Rom. 8:3; Heb. 2:14; John 12:31).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Overcoming Religion, Culture, and<br>the Tide and Amusements of This Age</H2><P>Not only so, in our living the God-man life, we must also overcome religion, culture, and the tide and amusements of this age. Is it good to celebrate Christmas? I must say that that is the culture of religion. Is it good to celebrate the New Year? I must say that that is the tradition of the world. We are having this conference during the Chinese New Year period, which causes many of you to forsake the tradition of celebrating the New Year. This is actually quite good. Also, what about celebrating birthdays? That is the tide of today's age. I must ask, when you are there singing the "happy birthday" song, can you say that God and you are singing together? Besides these, there are many other amusements of this age that we need to overcome. Paul said that the Lord gave Himself up for us to deliver us from the present evil age (Gal. 1:4). The age mentioned in Galatians 1:4 refers particularly to the religious world, which is Judaism. He also said, "Do not be fashioned according to this age" (Rom. 12:2). Hence, the God-man life also includes overcoming religion, culture, and the tide and amusements of this age.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Reigning as Kings by the Reigning<br>Life of Christ to Conquer All Persons,<br>Matters, and Things Contrary to God and<br>Be the Overcomers of the Lord in This Age</H2><P>Romans 5:17 and 21 say that we who have received the abundance of grace should reign in life through this abundance of grace. In 1938 I stayed in Peking for two months. One day a sister came to me and said, "Brother Lee, my husband loves to watch movies. He often watches them until midnight, and he even wants me to accompany him. What do you say I should do?" I said, "You tell me, what do you do?" She said, "When he comes home knocking on the door, I do not open the door for him. When he knocks again, I still do not open the door. A long time later I open the door for him. Once I open the door, I just walk away. I do not pay attention to him." Then I said, "You are wrong. When he wants to go to watch movies, you should take him there. When you arrive at the entrance, you should say to him, `Sorry, you know that because of the Lord I cannot go into the theater. Please excuse me. Peace be with you. I will be waiting for you at home. I will cook you the best refreshments. If you do not come home, I will not go to bed.' When he comes home, once you hear the sound of his footsteps, do not wait until he knocks; immediately open the door for him and present the refreshments for him to eat." She went and did as I told her. Eventually, her husband repented and believed in the Lord because of the way she treated him. This sister was reigning as a king in life. When we live the God-man life, we can reign as kings by the reigning life of Christ to conquer all persons, matters, and things that are contrary to God and be the overcomers of the Lord in this age (Rom. 5:17, 21; Rev. 2&#151;3).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE THIRD ASPECT OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY&#151;THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Universal Body of Christ<br>Being the Universal House of God<br>and the Kingdom of God As Well</H2><P>Finally, we need to see the third aspect of the Lord's recovery, that is, the practice of the church. First, the church as the universal Body of Christ is the universal house of God and also the kingdom of God (Eph. 1:23; 1 Tim. 3:15-16; Matt. 16:18-19). These three&#151;the Body of Christ, the house of God, and the kingdom of God&#151;are just one. The Body of Christ is the house of God, and the house of God is the kingdom of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Appearing in Various Cities as Local Churches, with One City Having Only One Church in Order to Keep the Oneness and Prevent Division</H2><P>The universal Body of Christ is the house of God, that is, the kingdom of God, appearing in various cities as local churches. The Bible shows us that one city should have only one church for the sake of keeping the oneness and preventing division (Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rev. 1:4, 11). Deuteronomy 12:5-18 clearly tells us that when the Israelites arrived in the good land, they could not choose a place of worship as they liked. They needed to go to the place where God had placed His name, which was the place where God would build His dwelling place. The Israelites needed to worship God there. In the Old Testament God chose Jerusalem. Hence, although the twelve tribes of Israel were scattered throughout the land of Israel, all their males had to go up to Jerusalem three times a year to worship God there. No one dared to set up another worship center besides Jerusalem. Later, Jeroboam rebelled. He set up Dan in the north and Bethel as worship centers and thus was cursed and punished by God, with the result that all the kings of the kingdom of Israel were rejected by God and excluded from the record of 2 Chronicles.</P><P>Today the practice of the church that God desires is the same as this in principle, that is, one city having only one church for the keeping of the oneness. One cannot say that he is not satisfied with the church in a certain locality and then start another meeting on the next street with a few of his more intimate brothers. Because Christianity is not willing to be restricted by one city having only one church, today's situation has become confused and divided.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Local Churches Are Scattered<br>in Different Places by Geography, yet They Are Not Divided by Any Doctrine or Matter</H2><P>The local churches in the various localities are scattered in different places by geography, yet they are not divided by any doctrine or matter (1 Cor. 1:10-13). Some people suggest that the local churches should be autonomous and that the churches should be independent. However, I must say that to be autonomous is the biggest division. The United States of America has only one federal government, one national defense, one diplomacy, one postal service, one monetary system, and one highway system that connects the whole country. If each state issued its own currency, the entire United States would have to issue fifty kinds of notes, and the market would be in turmoil. It is the same regarding the highways. The entire country has only one highway system. If the highways in each state could not be connected, then the transportation in the entire country would be choked. It is because of all these onenesses that the United States of America has become so strong and so great.</P><P>Furthermore, some said that although the Bible speaks of the apostles setting up churches and appointing elders, after a church is established and the elders are appointed, the apostles should take their hands off. However, the Bible clearly shows us that after Paul established the church in Ephesus, he continued to visit them and wrote letters to that church to care for them. One time he even stayed there for three years, admonishing them night and day, both publicly and in the homes (Acts 20:20, 31). On the way of Paul's last visit to Jerusalem, he even sent people from Miletus to go tens of miles away to ask the elders of the church in Ephesus to come, and he exhorted them to take heed to all the flock, to shepherd the church of God, which was purchased by God's own blood. He said this because he knew that after he departed wolves would come into their midst. Hence, after the apostles established the churches and appointed the elders, they did not leave them and cease caring for them; rather, they continued to care for the churches that they had established.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Unique Church of God Is Expressed<br>as Many Local Churches throughout the Whole Globe, yet They Are Still the Unique Universal Body of Christ and Should Not Be Divided<br>into Sects or Denominations</H2><P>In the practice of the church, although the unique church of God is expressed as the many local churches throughout the whole globe, the churches are still the unique universal Body of Christ and should not be divided into sects or denominations (1 Cor. 10:16-17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. There Should Not Be Any Hierarchy&#151;<br>Religious Organization or System of Rank</H2><P>In the practice of the church, although there are the apostles who establish the churches, and within each church there are elders who manage the church and deacons who serve the church, besides the order of these holy services, there should not be any hierarchy&#151;religious organization or system of rank (1 Cor. 9:1-3; 1 Tim. 3:1-13). In the Catholic Church today there is a hierarchy of the pope, the cardinals, the archbishops, the bishops, and the priests. In the Protestant churches, there is also the system of rank of the pastors and the common believers. All these should not exist, and these practices are not scriptural.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Local Churches in the Various Localities Take God's Eternal Economy as Their Center<br>to Bear the Unique Testimony of Christ</H2><P>In the practice of the church, although there are many local churches, they all take God's eternal economy as their center to bear the unique testimony of Christ. They do not teach any doctrine that is unrelated to God's economy and has nothing to do with the testimony of Christ. In 1 Timothy chapter one Paul wanted Timothy to remain in Ephesus to charge certain ones not to teach things that are different from God's economy (vv. 3-4). In the practice of the church, we should not teach any doctrine that is unrelated to God's economy and has nothing to do with the testimony of Christ. If we do, this will cause division.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. In These Local Churches There Should Be Righteousness, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Spirit as the Reality of the Kingdom of God</H2><P>In the practice of the church there should be righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit in the local churches as the reality of the kingdom of God (Rom. 14:17). The kingdom of God is the sphere in which God exercises His authority so that He may express His glory for the fulfillment of His purpose. In such a kingdom, what matters is not eating and drinking but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. Righteousness denotes that which is right and proper. Those who live in the kingdom of God should be right and proper toward others, toward things, and toward God; with them there should be nothing erroneous, improper, crooked, slanted, or biased. This requires that they be strict in dealing with themselves. Peace is the fruit of righteousness (Heb. 12:11 and note). It characterizes the relationship that those who live in the kingdom of God should have with others and with God. If we are righteous, right, and proper toward others, toward things, and toward God, we will have a peaceful relationship with others and with God. Thus, we will have joy in the Holy Spirit and, in particular, before God. In this way, we will be filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit (Acts 13:52) and will live out righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit, which are the reality of the kingdom of God. This proves that the normal church life is the kingdom of God on the earth today.</P><P>In conclusion, the Lord's recovery has not only the revelation of God but also the God-man life; and the God-man life requires a proper practice of the church. I cannot say that in the church everyone is a God-man, an overcomer; but I can say that in the church the opportunity for us to be a God-man is greater, and it is easier to be an overcomer. This is because in the Lord's recovery, every local church is daily nurturing us to be overcomers, to be God-men. I hope that the elders and the co-workers in every locality will create an environment in the church to nurture the saints to be God-men to live an overcoming life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PRESENT URGENT NEEDS<br>IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H2><P>In the Lord's recovery there are a few matters that are urgent at the present time to which we should pay special attention. First, every brother and sister needs to ask the Lord for a new revival. Although we have so much vision, we still need to ask the Lord for a new revival. This revival is the God-man life. In every church, we all need to live the God-man life. Whether we are at home or in the workplace, we all need to live the God-man life.</P><P>Second, we need to produce vital groups and endeavor to gain people to be members of the Body of Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ. Every member should be living, organic, and not in organization, especially not in arrangement. It is through the vital groups that we all can become the living members in the Body of Christ.</P><P>Third, every brother and sister in the Lord's recovery needs to pursue prophesying for the building up of the Body of Christ. We should not make any excuses, saying that we are weak and without strength. Every one of us has the consummated Triune God, who has become the life-giving Spirit, living within us to enable us to pursue prophesying, to speak for the Lord for the building up of the Body of Christ. These are the present urgent needs of the Lord's recovery. I hope that the Lord will be gracious to us so that we can receive these words and actually practice them in our living and in our church.</P></body></html>
