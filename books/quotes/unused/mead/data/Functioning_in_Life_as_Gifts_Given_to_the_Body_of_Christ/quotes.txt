[1]  Functioning in Life as Gifts Given to the Body of Christ CONTENTS
[2]  CHAPTER ONE FUNCTIONING IN LIFE BY USING OUR TALENT Scripture Reading: Matt 25:14-30
[3]  If something does not grow, it does not have life.
[4]  Now we may consider some passages in the New Testament concerning the function of life.
[5]  The one who had the one talent said, Master, I knew about you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not winnow v. 24 . Is this statement right or wrong? On the one hand, the Lord admitted to this, saying, Evil and slothful slave, you knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I did not winnow v. 26 . In another sense, though, it was not right for the evil slave to say that, because the Lord had sown one talent for him.
[6]  The principle in this passage is that we simply have to function.
[7]  In some churches among us, the responsible brothers also have this wrong concept, saying, These brothers and sisters do not know how to do something, so we will not let them do it.
[8]  CHAPTER TWO THE GIFTS ACCORDING TO GRACE Scripture Reading: Rom 12:6a, 1-2, 11; Eph 4:7-16
[9]  Apparently Romans 12 is easy to understand, but in actuality it is not easy to get into this portion of the Word.
[10]  Again we may compare it to the title of God referred to by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 22:32: The God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.
[11]  As members, the kind of gift, or function, that we have depends on the quantity of Christ as life that we have.
[12]  If we have only a small amount of Christ, if our capacity to take Christ in is small and limited, we can have only a small function; the function that is given to us will be very limited.
[13]  If we had such a great capacity to contain Christ, we also would have a function like Paul s. The gift is given according to the capacity of grace, that is, of Christ as life.
[14]  Second, we must be transformed in the soul by the renewing of our mind, the leading part of the soul v. 2 . Our body has to be offered, released, and set free from so many occupations, and our soul, our being, has to be transformed.
[15]  The more we bring in natural concepts, the more we will be killed in function.
[16]  In order to function in a proper, adequate way, we have to be transformed by the renewing of our mind.
[17]  Third, we have to be burning in our spirit v. 11 . Our body has to be offered, our soul has to be transformed, and our spirit has to be burning by contacting the Lord.
[18]  Our capacity for grace depends on these three things we offer our body to the Lord, we are willing to be transformed, and we are burned by the Lord day by day.
[19]  Then according to this capacity of grace, the Lord will give us a certain function as a gift, and we ourselves will become a gift given to the Body.
[20]  To have the Lord s recovery is not merely to have the doctrine of the recovery.
[21]  No, we must be in Romans 12, offering our body, being transformed in our being our soul with the mind as the leading part and being burned in our spirit all the time.
[22]  We all will have a gift, that is, a function, and we will be equipped with this gift.
[23]  In this chapter we also see the coordination of the Body and that all the functions, regardless of what kind they are, must be for the building up of the Body v. 16 . Grace is given according to the gift, the bigger gifts are for the perfecting of the smaller ones, and the smaller gifts have to function under the perfecting of the bigger ones.
[24]  CHAPTER THREE THE MEMBERS GIVEN AS GIFTS TO THE BODY Scripture Reading: Psa 68:18; Eph 4:7-16
[25]  In the previous message we saw that grace is given according to the measure of the gift of Christ Eph 4:7 .
[26]  It is not easy to have this kind of concept, but if we have the heavenly, spiritual insight, we can see the real meaning here.
[27]  The last phrase, that Jehovah God may dwell among them, is not quoted in Ephesians 4:7, but the context of Ephesians deals with God s dwelling place.
[28]  When we have such a member, we may not sense its practicality, but if we were to lose it, we would sense the awkwardness of not having it.
[29]  In Ephesians 4 the gifts are the members, and grace is given according to the size of the members, that is, according to the measure of the gift.
[30]  Just as blood is supplied to a member of our body according to its measure, its size, grace is given to the members of the Body of Christ according to their measure as a gift.
[31]  If someone is a big member, he has a bigger capacity for more grace, but if he is a small member, his capacity to receive grace is smaller.
[32]  Before chapter four of Ephesians there is chapter two, which tells us that we have been raised up together with Christ and seated together with Him in the heavenlies v. 6 . Negatively, we have to deny the soul, the natural man, and positively, we have to realize that we are now in the heavenlies.
[33]  In order to perfect others, the first thing we must do is minister life to them to help them to grow.
[34]  Then we must give them the opportunity to serve, that is, to function.
[35]  When I was young, by the Lord s mercy I came in contact with Brother Watchman Nee, and under the Lord s sovereignty I was put under his hand.
[36]  On the one hand, he did not merely teach me, but on the other hand, he taught me very much.
[37]  He convicts concerning sin because we are in Adam, concerning righteousness because we need to be transferred into Christ, and concerning judgment because if we are still in Adam and not willing to be transferred into Christ, we will be judged with Satan.
[38]  In the church the bigger members must learn to perfect others, and the smaller, younger members must learn to take the perfecting.
[39]  This is not merely to submit but to receive perfecting.
[40]  We must also grow up into Christ in all things to have the full growth.
[41]  Then verse 15 says that we grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ.
[42]  What do we call this flow when it comes down into man?
[43]  Isaiah 9:6 says For a child is born to us, / A son is given to us; / And the government / Is upon His shoulder; / And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, / Mighty God, / Eternal Father, / Prince of Peace.
[44]  Christ s producing of the members for His Body was His receiving of the gifts from the Father, because the Father is the source.
[45]  We are the members of the Body, and since we are members, we are gifts to the Body.
[46]  Psalm 68:18 concludes with: You have received gifts among men, / Even the rebellious ones also, / That Jehovah God may dwell among them.
[47]  The purpose for the producing of the members, the receiving of the gifts, and the giving of the gifts to the Body is the building up of the dwelling place of God on this earth among men.
[48]  Verses 11 and 12 say, And He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.
[49]  If we brothers and sisters here do not realize this flow, then regardless of how much we talk about the church life and the Body life, we still will not have it, and we will not be able to have it.
[50]  If we will forget about our own needs, our family problems, and even other people s needs and simply remember the Lord s need for this flow of life, and if we will pray for this, right away we will sense the flowing and the anointing within.
[51]  This is referred to as regeneration in 1:3: Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
[52]  Third, the way to grow is by feeding on the Lord, which includes tasting Him v. 3 . If we have ever tasted the Lord, we will want to feed on Him.
[53]  Then the more we come to Him, the more we drink of Him, feed on Him, and take Him in. It is by this contact with the Lord that we grow.
[54]  This growth by feeding on the Lord causes us to be transformed into living stones.
[55]  Originally, we were not living stones; we were merely clay, something made of earth and dust.
[56]  The more we feed on Christ, the more we grow in Him, and the more we grow in Him, the more we are transformed.
[57]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE PRIESTHOOD 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 2:5, 9
[58]  In order to see what the function of the divine life is, we have to see more concerning the priesthood.
[59]  We must consider what a priest is, what the life of a priest is, and what the function of a priest is.
[60]  Moreover, we may ask who were the first priests in the Bible, who are the last priests, and what is the difference between a priest, a king, and a prophet.
[61]  Rather, we must say that a priest is a person who serves God through Christ as the reality of the offerings Lev 1 7 .
[62]  In the New Testament, in 1 Peter 2, we see that the house of God is the priesthood composed of all the priests v. 5 . Therefore, every priest is an item of the material for the building of the house.
[63]  When a priest is mingled with God, spontaneously he becomes a part of the house of God.
[64]  To be transformed by God is to be mingled with God.
[65]  We are filled with Christ, covered with Christ, one with Christ, and mingled with Christ, so whatever we pass on, share, and minister to others is Christ not knowledge, forms, or anything else.
[66]  One Who Builds Up the Dwelling Place of God
[67]  Lastly, a priest is a person who builds up the dwelling place of God.
[68]  Indeed, it is He who will build the temple of Jehovah; and He will bear majesty and will sit and rule on His throne; and He will be a priest on His throne; and the counsel of peace will be between the two of them.
[69]  CHAPTER EIGHT THE PRIESTHOOD 2 Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26; Rev 1:6; 20:6; 22:3-5 THE MINISTRY OF THE PRIESTS, THE KINGS,
[70]  In this portion of the Bible there are kings among the Gentiles, but there is no king among the people of God.
[71]  When we are in Ephesians and Romans, there is no need of 1 Corinthians 12 and 14, but when we are abnormal in the church life, we need the prophets; we need the gifts.
[72]  He created man with His image that man may be His expression, and He committed His authority to man that man may be His representative.
[73]  Verse 6 of chapter twenty also says, Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no authority, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years.
[74]  This is not a mere exhortation for us to function.
[75]  We must realize that function is a matter of life.
[76]  Therefore, we have to feast on the Lord, live by Him, and mingle with Him, as the priests did.
[77]  We must be that kind of person with that kind of life, enjoyment of life, and growth of life.
[78]  I hope that by His mercy, the churches in all the localities may have a life full of the priesthood with the kingship, not requiring the ministry of the prophets; that is, that we would have much life without the need of much gift.
