<h1 class=msg>Lesson Eighteen</h1><h1 class=msg>THE PRAYER MINISTRY OF THE CHURCH</h1><h2 class=head2>Scripture Reading</h2><h1 class=scripture>Matt. 16:18-19; 18:18-19; Eph. 6:17-20; Ezek. 36:37; Isa. 62:6-7; 1 John 1:9; Acts 1:14; 4:31; 12:5; 13:2-4; 20:36</h1><h2 class=head2>Outline</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The principles of God’s work</li><li>The prayer ministry of the church—binding and loosing what has been bound and loosed in heaven</li><li>Examples of prayer in Acts</li><li>Two types of prayer	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Prayer to have fellowship with God</li>	<li>Prayer for God’s work</li>	</ol></li><li>Individual and corporate prayer</li><li>Pray specifically and persistently</li><li>Pray at set times and all the time</li><li>Pray with the Word and a note book</li></ol><h2 class=head2>Text</h2><p>In this lesson we will fellowship concerning one of the most crucial ministries of the church—the prayer ministry. We agree that Christians should pray. Do you pray? How often do you pray? How consistent is your prayer? Are your prayers answered? If you ask any Christian the same questions, you will find that most Christians rarely pray. Why? Most of us do not realize that prayer is important. We may not know how to pray, or we may not understand the principles of prayer. Our prayer may be non-effective and meaningless. We hope that this lesson will change all that. After you study this lesson and practice accordingly, you will be a proper serving one in the prayer ministry of the church.
