   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We have to visit people in their homes to pass on the gospel to them.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I hope that all the churches will try to enter into preaching the gospel by visiting people in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Once they believe and are baptized, we have to go back to them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the first month it is best if we can visit them ten times.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to continue to visit them in order to nourish and cherish them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the first two or three times with them, we should do our best to help them realize that our Savior, Jesus Christ, is today the life-giving Spirit in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They need to realize that they have a regenerated spirit which they can exercise by calling on the name of the Lord and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whenever we exercise our spirit, He moves and works within us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We can also help them to speak, first by helping them to give a testimony of their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From the very beginning, we can train them to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every time we go to visit them, we can check with them, "Do you have something to say for the Lord or of the Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should always do this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then from the very beginning of their Christian life, they will learn to speak the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We do not have many verses in the Bible to tell us how to carry out the home meetings and small group meetings, but we know that we need to pray much, exercise our spirit, and release our spirit when we meet with the new ones in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to pray, praise, sing, and read verses from the Scriptures in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then the new ones will follow us and learn from us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The children spontaneously speak the language of their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we release our spirit, they will learn from us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we speak, we can also instruct and encourage them to speak by exercising their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We can encourage them to first tell how they were saved and then encourage them to speak concerning how they experienced the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They may say: "This morning I did not have any joy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then I prayed to the Lord and called upon Him, and I became joyful."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We can encourage them by saying: "Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is a good testimony."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After about three months, they can be brought into the habit of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to go on from the home meetings to bring them into contact with other saints in their neighborhood for a small group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the small group meetings, there is the need of further teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is helpful to use either the Life Lessons or Truth Lessons because all the necessary verses and material are there.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is not necessary to try to finish a lesson in one session.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may cover one lesson in three meetings with them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We also need to perfect the new ones to prophesy in the larger church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Recently, I heard a new one who had only been saved for one year stand up in a meeting to speak on the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He spoke a good message concerning all the different titles of the Spirit, the essential and economical aspects of the Spirit, and the functions of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Such a new one is evidence that the new way really works.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If there are fifty saints in a local church, we need to look to the Lord that all of them will be occupied with some practical service to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Fifteen saints could go out to gain people by knocking on their doors.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Another fifteen may take care of the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Perhaps the ones who go out to preach the gospel could transfer the care of their new ones to the ones who are burdened for home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Another fifteen saints could pick up the burden to take care of the small group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Within a short time, maybe just three or four months, all fifty saints could be occupied with some practical service to the Lord, taking care of new ones and young ones.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If each saint could take care of one newly baptized one for one year, think how much this new one would grow!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All the teaching materials, the lesson books, are ready for us to use.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We can pass these things on to the new ones through the Spirit by much prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>By taking this way, it will be easy for the church to double in a year.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The new ones that we gain will be born, raised up, and taught in the scriptural way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They will be xerox copies of us, doing the same thing that we do in our service.</S>
