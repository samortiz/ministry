A church is local. That is why we have the church in Ephesus, the church in Colosse, and the church in Corinth. But the work is more than local. The book of Acts shows us that the first group of workers went from Jerusalem to Samaria, and then to all the other places. These workers were not limited to the one locality of Jerusalem, but they were limited to the region of Judea. Hence, this shows us that their work was regional.</P><P>At Antioch, there was a new beginning. There we see Paul and Barnabas going out to start the work among the Gentiles. In the Gentile world there were the churches in Galatia and the churches in Asia. These churches form one region. Hence, in the Bible, there is not only the company of Peter preaching the gospel; there is also the company of Barnabas preaching the gospel. In Philippians, it even mentions another group of people (1:15-17) working in a different region. Paul said that the measure apportioned to him allowed him to reach even as far as the Corinthians (2 Cor. 10:13-14). In other words, Paul had his region of work.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Work Being Divided into Regions,<br>but the Fellowship Being One</H2><P>There are regions to the work, and each region includes certain localities. Under normal circumstances, though the regions are different, there is still a oneness between the regions. When the relationship is normal, all the works in the different regions maintain the one fellowship. Jerusalem is one with Antioch. Although they belong to different regions, they still have fellowship before the Lord. When people were saved in Antioch, Jerusalem sent some men over to help (Acts 11:20-28). Jerusalem also sent out Barnabas and Paul (Acts 9:28-30). Antioch was something that came out of Jerusalem and that returned back to Jerusalem. When Jerusalem was short of money, Antioch sent money from the Gentiles to Jerusalem (Acts 11:27-29). Barnabas went from Jerusalem to Antioch (Acts 11:22), and Paul returned from Antioch to Jerusalem (Acts 15:2). Here we see that although regions are different, the fellowship remains one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Elders Being Responsible for the Church,<br>and the Apostles Being Responsible for the Work</H2><P>The elders are responsible for the church in the localities (Titus 1:5), whereas the apostles are responsible for the work in the region. Peter and his co-workers were in charge of the work in Judea, whereas Paul and his co-workers were in charge of Antioch and the work in the Gentile world. The apostles worked within the regions assigned to them by God (2 Cor. 10:13).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_249.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_251.html">Next</a> </body></html>
