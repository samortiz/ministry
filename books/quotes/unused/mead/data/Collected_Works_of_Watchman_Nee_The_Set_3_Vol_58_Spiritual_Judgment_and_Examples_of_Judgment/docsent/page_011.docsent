   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR SPIRITUAL JUDGMENT 4 HEALING Date:October 2, 1948 HOW TO CURE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After we have studied the condition of the brothers and sisters and have discovered their problems, we can start to diagnose their situation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We can begin talking to them and leading them on the way to deliverance and healing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is easy to speak about this process, but when we are confronted with practical problems, we have to be able to open others' eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order for others to experience deliverance, we must have the adequate experience ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Furthermore, we must be able to relate this experience clearly and thoroughly to others so that they will receive the help, light, and deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are frustrated in rendering help to others because we are short in experience and short in utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If both our experience and utterance are adequate, others will see the light.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A few years ago, I was not able to render help to a brother because my own experience was short.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was strong-willed, arrogant, and quick-tempered.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many people have a quick temper, but they are not arrogant.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This brother was strong-willed as well as quick-tempered.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was not easy to deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Having a strong will is not disastrous when it is coupled with a well-tempered emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In such a case the problem is confined to the person himself; when he loses his temper, he only has to confess his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But if a person has a strong will that is coupled with an impulsive emotion and extreme subjectivity, he will be driven to act by impulse.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He also will insist on his impulse without any thought of repentance whatsoever.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This combination of traits is a great problem.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some people only have one problem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Others have two or three which affect each other and complicate the issue.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In pathology, when two diseases in a person do not affect each another, a cure to both is simple.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But if they affect each other, they are harder to heal, and the sickness can become more serious.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The same can be said of human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have to understand the interaction of different dispositions within a person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A person who is strong in his will and also arrogant and quick-tempered requires strong and severe dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After we know the condition of a brother, there are two ways to help him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Exhortation</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first way to help a brother is by exhortation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should point out the way of deliverance to him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some people have never seen any light.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They are blind to themselves all the time, and no one has ever said an honest word to them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As we talk to them, we should tell them what we have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have to tell them our experience and let them know that they should experience the dealings and the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have to show them that their pathway is not a straight one, that they are living by the mind and the emotion, and that their spirit is not strong.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In addition, their rejection of the discipline of the Holy Spirit in many areas has resulted in their many problems with God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the light we render is clear, we will be able to save them out of their condition.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We cannot be unclear in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Light always brings in deliverance as well as liberation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have to point out that they have not accepted the discipline of the Holy Spirit in this and that matter.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our word of exhortation has to be very positive.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It cannot be general, and it must be very accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should point out a few things to them to prove our point.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Committing accidental mistakes is not a frequent occurrence for a person.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Most of the time we commit dispositional and temperamental mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Those who are slow are always slow.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who are quick are always quick.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Dispositional or temperamental mistakes relate to the person.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are here to help others correct their dispositional or temperamental mistakes, not their accidental mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our help to others should not be general.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It has to be very specific, and it must follow a definite order.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>First, we must make note of the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should have a notebook in which we write down the mistakes of others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For example, a brother may speak inaccurately habitually.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The first time we hear him we should write down what he said and where he said it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If it is a dispositional mistake, he will surely repeat the same mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should write down such occurrences again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After ten or twenty times, perhaps we will be convinced that his mistake is a dispositional one.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When the opportunity arises at the proper time, we should point out to him that his words are not accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Second, we have to be strengthened in our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need to build up ourselves in God before we can have the strength to help others.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As the entries in our notebook increase, the strength in our inner being should also increase.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Our inward condition must grow sharper, higher, and stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We have to wait until our inward condition is strong enough before we can extend help to others.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A brother may lie once, twice, or many times.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Every time we catch him lying we should write down the occasion.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As his mistakes increase, the pressure within us to help him should also increase.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>At a certain point we will be ready to deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Third, we have to wait for a suitable time to speak to him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As time goes on, the burden within us will increase.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When the indignation reaches a certain level, we should pray for God to open up an opportunity to speak to him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>As we speak to him, we should note the following: 1 We should say to him, "I need to say a few words to you.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You do not have to answer me.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The words may be right or they may be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But you should take my words and consider them before the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Do not give him a chance to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>2 We should continue, saying, "These words are for your own good.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I have no desire to meddle with your affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I do not interfere with others' business.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I am doing this to help you."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>3 We can also add, "I say this without any personal motive of my own."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We should then point out examples of his lying and let him see that he is accustomed to lying.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We should say, "You have to repent before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Otherwise, you will not have a way to go on."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>While we are speaking, we should not turn our face aside.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Some problems, such as lying, need to be addressed in a solemn way.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Other problems only need to be addressed in a light way.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Serious sins have to be addressed seriously, while trivial sins need to be addressed lightly.</S>
