<h1 class="title">GOD BEING THE ELEMENT OF LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 20:28; 10:18; Heb. 2:17-18</h1>
<p>The purpose of the Triune God is to dwell in us to be our life. In order to enter into us, God has worked in three steps. God dwells in unapproachable light (1 Tim. 6:16). One day, as the Word, He was incarnated and manifested among man in order to be with man (John 1:1, 14). Then after thirty-three and a half years He died on the cross and was resurrected to become the Spirit (Rom. 1:3-4; 1 Cor. 15:45). He became the Spirit so that He can enter into those who believe into Him (John 20:21-22). This is how the Triune God enters into man as life. God the Father is the source, and man cannot approach or touch Him. This God is embodied in the Son and was manifested among man. Then He died and was resurrected to become the Spirit in order to enter into man. These are the three steps that God took to enter into us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ELEMENTS OF GOD</h2>
<p>The Triune God with all His elements has entered into us. We often neglect God&rsquo;s elements. When we consider God, we think of Him as being the Father, Son, and Spirit, but there are other elements within God. The elements of the Triune God, that is, what is in Him, are not so simple. There are at least seven elements.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Element of Divinity</h2>
<p>The first element of God is His divinity, His divine nature. When God enters into us to be our life, we receive the divine nature of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Element of Humanity</h2>
<p>God also has the element of humanity, the human nature. Before He became flesh, He was purely God; He had the divine nature. One day, however, He became a man; He put on humanity and was mingled with man. Thus, He possesses not only divinity but also humanity. Some saints have been saved for many years, but they do not realize that the Lord whom they worship and in whom they believe is not merely God but also man. I hope that we can see this fact. When God was incarnated, He put on humanity, and the human element was added to Him.</p>
<p>After the Lord Jesus was resurrected, Thomas said to Him, &ldquo;My Lord and my God!&rdquo; (20:28). At that time the Lord was not merely God; He was also a man. Before incarnation, in the Old Testament, God was only God; He did not have the human element. But in the New Testament God was incarnated; He became a man and was mingled with man. Furthermore, through His death and resurrection, He brought man into God. Hence, in John 20:28 He had not only divinity but also humanity. The human element was added to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Element of Human Living</h2>
<p>God possesses the element of human living. God became flesh and lived on the earth as a man for thirty-three and a half years. This is something that He did not have before His incarnation. For thirty-three and a half years the incarnated God lived on the earth. On one hand, this man was the holy God, but on the other hand, He lived as a genuine man.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John says that the Lord Jesus is God, and it also shows how He lived as a man. In chapter 3 He received a Jewish ruler, who was a proper man, at night. In chapter 4 He was in a different situation, in which He contacted an infamous woman. He met her during the day in an open area. The matter of time and place speaks of how a person conducts himself. What kind of impression would we have if the Lord had received the infamous woman in the same way that He received the Jewish ruler, that is, at night? How would that influence us?</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus also knew that it would not be appropriate to discuss the woman&rsquo;s history while His disciples were present. He knew that she would be greatly embarrassed, so He waited alone at the well to talk to her when she came. Furthermore, the Lord did not speak severely when He touched the details of her background. He simply followed her words. He said, &ldquo;You have well said, I do not have a husband, for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband; this you have said truly&rdquo; (vv. 17-18). How tactful the Lord was, yet His words hit the mark. This situation shows the condition of His being a proper man. He is Lord, and He is God. As God, He does not need to care for such details, but He did. This is an aspect of His human living.</p>
<p>In chapter 7 the Lord&rsquo;s flesh brothers came to Him and said, &ldquo;Depart from here and go into Judea;...for no one does anything in secret and himself seeks to be known openly. If You do these things, manifest Yourself to the world&rdquo; (vv. 3-4). His brothers thought that it was the time for Him to go up to Jerusalem for the feast, but He replied, &ldquo;My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready&rdquo; (v. 6). This shows another aspect of His human living. From the aspect of being God, He transcends time and is not limited by time. However, at this point, He was a man and was living the human life; hence, He was willing to be subject to various restrictions. This shows that the Lord has not only the human element but also the element of human living.</p>
<p>According to Hebrews 2:17-18, the element of human living includes the suffering of temptations and afflictions: &ldquo;Hence He should have been made like His brothers in all things...For being tempted in that which He Himself has suffered, He is able to help those who are being tempted.&rdquo; He also suffered temptations, in which He had contact with the devil and experienced how the devil tempts man. In other words, He fought the battle with the devil, and He did it as a man. Before God became flesh, He was God, but He did not have the experience of being a man. Hence, He was without the element of suffering through temptations. Because He lived as a man for thirty-three and a half years, He has not only the element of divinity but also the element of human living, including the experiences of suffering, being tempted, and overcoming the devil.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Knowing and Experiencing God as Life &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
