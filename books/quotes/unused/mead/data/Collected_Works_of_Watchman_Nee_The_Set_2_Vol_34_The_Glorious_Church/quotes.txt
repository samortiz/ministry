[3]  The following chapters are translations of a series of messages spoken in Chinese by Brother Watchman Nee to the church in Shanghai and the co-workers who were under his training for a longer period, from the fall of 1939 to the fall of 1942.
[4]  These were times of spiritual revelations and heavenly visions concerning "the deep things of God."
[5]  The stress was primarily on the triumphant church, the glorious Body of Christ, the full expression of Him who fills all in all.
[6]  Our prayer goes with this book, trusting that God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, "who is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think," would work out what is revealed in these messages, "according to the power which operates in us."
[7]  CHAPTER ONE GOD'S PLAN AND GOD'S REST Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26 2:3; 2:18-24; Eph 5:22-32; Rev 12; 21:1 22:5
[8]  Four women are mentioned in these four passages of the Scriptures.
[9]  May God grant us light to see how these four women are related to one another and to His eternal plan.
[10]  Then we may see the position the church occupies and the responsibility she bears in this plan and how the overcomers of God will accomplish His eternal purpose.
[11]  Before God created man, He said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth."
[12]  Verse 26 says, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness..."; but verse 27 says, "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."
[13]  Perhaps some may ask why God has such a purpose.
[14]  It is because an angel of light rebelled against God before man's creation and became the devil: Satan sinned and fell; the Daystar became the enemy of God Isa 14:12-15 .
[15]  God, therefore, withdrew His authority from the enemy and put it, instead, into the hand of man.
[16]  The reason God created man is that man may rule in the place of Satan.
[17]  Not only does God desire that man should rule, but He marks out a specific area for man to rule.
[18]  Not only did God give man dominion over the fish of the sea, the birds of the heavens, and the cattle, but He further required that man should rule over "all the earth."
[19]  Not only in His plan to create man was God's attention focused upon the earth, but after God made man, He clearly told him that he was to rule over the earth.
[20]  God wanted to have man to rule for Him on this earth, but man did not attain to God's purpose.
[21]  In Genesis 3 the fall took place and sin entered; man came under the power of Satan, and everything seemed to come to an end. Satan was seemingly victorious and God was seemingly defeated.
[22]  Genesis 1 speaks of the will of God at creation, Psalm 8 speaks of God's will after man's fall, and Hebrews 2 speaks of God's will in redemption.
[23]  We will see that in the victory of redemption God still desires man to obtain authority and deal with Satan.
[24]  The Lord Jesus stood in two positions: to God He was the man at the beginning, the man whom God appointed from the very first, and to man He is the Savior.
[25]  We do not mean that He did not have the glory of God, but Hebrews 2 does not refer to the glory which He possessed as God.
[26]  In all six days of God's work of creation, His creation of man was distinct.
[27]  In order to do this, God first had to repair the ruined earth and heaven.
[28]  But the second part, "in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens," refers to His repair and restoration work, since in this work the earth was cared for first and then the heaven.
[29]  The word "rested" is the declaration that God was satisfied, that God delighted in what He had done; it proclaims that God's purpose was attained and His good pleasure was accomplished to the fullest.
[30]  First Corinthians 15 says that Adam was a type of the Lord Jesus, and Romans 5 says that Adam was a figure of the man who was to come.
[31]  God very carefully recorded the creation of this woman in Genesis 2, and when we come to Ephesians 5 we are clearly told that Eve typifies the church.
[32]  By then, everything was completed, and we find that Genesis 1 ends with this record: "And God saw every thing that He had made, and, behold, it was very good" v. 31 . From this we realize that having Adam alone, or we may say, having Christ alone, is not enough to satisfy God's heart.
[33]  God desired to have Christ, and God also desired to have a church which is exactly like Christ.
[34]  Genesis 2:19-20 says, "And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.
[35]  God brought every kind of living creature before Adam, but Adam could not find his help meet among them.
[36]  From these verses we see that if the church is not in a state which corresponds with Christ, God will not rest and His work will not be completed.
[37]  Some people were very frank before they believed in the Lord.
[38]  After they were saved, they used their frankness to serve God.
[39]  There are many who think that they can be Christians all by themselves!
[40]  We have already seen that Eve was not made of dust, but of Adam; Adam was the material of which Eve was made.
[41]  It says, "The Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam" v. 21 . This verse does not say that God caused Adam to die, but that He caused him to fall into a deep sleep.
[42]  When we read Ephesians 5:25, we find the same meaning.
[43]  "Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her."
[44]  The context of Ephesians 5 is not that Christ came to die for us because we were sinners, but that He gave Himself up for us because we are the church.
[45]  Even though we are fallen and full of failure, even though we are fleshly and soulish, departing far from God and disobeying Him, God will still attain His purpose.
[46]  From eternity God purposed to obtain a church completely out of Christ, a church containing no impurity of man, no element of earth, nor any savor of sin.
[47]  If we look at the type in Genesis 2, we can also see the relationship between the Body and the bride.
[48]  Eve was made out of Adam's rib, so she was the body of Adam.
[49]  But after Eve was made, God brought her to Adam, and she became the bride of Adam.
[50]  For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church."
[51]  In the eyes of Christ, the church is His own Body, bone of His bone and flesh of His flesh.
[52]  These verses show us that the church is the Body of Christ, and that His work toward the church today is to nourish and cherish it, because the church is Himself.
[53]  "Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her that He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word, that He might present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things, but that she would be holy and without blemish."
[54]  John 3:16 is a verse many of us can quote from memory.
[55]  Perhaps we have known it for ten or twenty years.
[56]  Certainly it is the Word of God, but it is logos.
[57]  Therefore, we must ask God, "O God, if You would be gracious to me, I pray that You would always give me rhema."
[58]  In Acts 11:16 Peter said, "And I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said, John baptized in water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit."
[59]  While Peter was preaching to the household of Cornelius, the Spirit of the Lord fell upon them, and the word of the Lord came to Peter.
[60]  It was not that Peter tried to recall the word from his memory, but it was the Lord who spoke to him, "John baptized with water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit."
[61]  Therefore, the whole matter of our growth and progress depends upon our attitude towards life and rhema.
[62]  If we have any inner feeling in life, we should never let it go.
[63]  If the Lord first gives us rhema, speaking to us first, then we still need to ask Him to supply us with life to deal with the matter.
[64]  If we pay attention to these matters and do not take them lightly, the Lord will cleanse us by the washing of the water in the word that we may be sanctified.
[65]  Before the Lord, the meaning of the church being cleansed by the washing of water is that the life of Christ deals with every part that is not out of Christ.
[66]  When God speaks to us through His word, we are enlightened; through His word we are sanctified; and through His word we are made to grow.
[67]  What is Christ's purpose in His cleansing and sanctifying work?
[68]  Ephesians 4 says that the church will arrive at the oneness of the faith and the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ v. 13 . Then chapter five says that the church will be clothed with glory to be presented to Christ.
[69]  The book of Ephesians reveals the church which God has purposed in eternity.
[70]  Chapter five tells how the church will be a glorious church, without spot or wrinkle or any such things, holy and without blemish.
[71]  And I heard a loud voice in heaven saying, Now has come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ, for the accuser of our brothers has been cast down, who accuses them before our God day and night."
[72]  When the Pharisees asked when the kingdom of God would come, the Lord Jesus answered, "The kingdom of God does not come with observation; nor will they say, Behold, here it is! or, There!
[73]  Revelation 1:5-6 says, "To Him who loves us and has released us from our sins by His blood and made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father, to Him be the glory and the might forever and ever.
[74]  The work of the church on earth is to bring in the kingdom of God.
[75]  If the coming of the kingdom of God was automatic, the Lord would never have taught us to pray in this way.
[76]  Yes, the church should preach the gospel, but much more, the church should pray to bring in the kingdom of God.
[77]  Then we will not only be a church which is glorious, holy, and without blemish, but we will also be those who have cooperated with God to bring in His kingdom and caused Satan to suffer loss on this earth.
[78]  CHAPTER FOUR "AND SHE BROUGHT FORTH...A MAN-CHILD"
[79]  We have already seen the woman in Genesis 2 and how she speaks of the man whom God in His eternal will desires to obtain to glorify His name.
[80]  This woman shows how God is working to restore everything to His original purpose after man's fall.
[81]  Verse 15 says, "And the seventh angel trumpeted; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever."
[82]  Beginning with chapter twelve we are told how the kingdom of this world will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ and how God will make His Son King forever and ever.
[83]  The rainbow around the throne signifies that God will not do anything harmful to man, while the ark in the temple signifies that God will not do anything that comes short of Himself.
[84]  Revelation 12:1 says, "And a great sign was seen in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon underneath her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars."
[85]  Revelation 12:2 says, "And she was with child, and she cried out, travailing in birth and being in pain to bring forth."
[86]  Revelation 12:5 continues, "And her child was caught up to God and to His throne."
[87]  There it says that some will be caught up in the clouds, while here it says that the man-child was caught up to the throne of God.
[88]  The Scripture says that this man-child will "shepherd all the nations with an iron rod."
[89]  The church which God desires must have the characteristic of Abigail that of cooperation with Christ.
[90]  Since the church, however, has not attained to God's purpose, nor does she even know God's purpose, what can God do?
[91]  Then Moses said to them, "Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor" v. 27 . The worshiping of idols is the greatest sin, so God required these men to slay their own brothers with the sword.
[92]  In Revelation 3:21 the Lord Jesus said, "He who overcomes, to him I will give to sit with Me on My throne."
[93]  The voice from heaven tells us, "They overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb."
[94]  He may accuse us, but we can answer that the blood of Jesus Christ, God's Son, cleanses us from every sin 1 John 1:7 .
[95]  When we commit sin, we do not glorify God, but when we do not trust the precious blood, we dishonor Him even more.
[96]  The precious blood is the basis for spiritual warfare.
[97]  If we do not know the value of the blood, we cannot fight.
[98]  The second thing is that the brothers overcame him "because of the word of their testimony."
[99]  When you have the blood before God, you will have boldness before God, and you will have a testimony before man.
[100]  It is a fact that the kingdom of heaven will come; it is a fact that the Lord is King; it is a fact that Christ is victorious and forever victorious; it is a fact that Satan is defeated; it is a fact that the strong man has been bound and legally condemned; it is a fact that Christ has destroyed all the work of Satan on the cross.
[101]  We have spoken of the basis of overcoming, but what is the experience of the overcomers themselves?
[102]  We have already seen that the woman in Genesis 2 is the same woman seen in Ephesians 5 and in Revelation 12.
[103]  God created the heaven and the earth in Genesis, and the new heaven and the new earth are in the last two chapters of Revelation.
[104]  In Genesis there is a river flowing out from Eden, and in Revelation there is a river of living water flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb.
[105]  One man has some talent and thinks that he can preach after he has studied a little theology.
[106]  Babylon had her beginning in the tower of Babel.
[107]  But God will judge her in the end. Revelation 19:1-4 says, "After these things I heard as it were a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, Hallelujah! The salvation and the glory and the power are of our God.
[108]  For true and righteous are His judgments; for He has judged the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her fornication, and He avenged the blood of His slaves at her hand.
[109]  When God judges the harlot and shatters all her work, and when He casts out all that she is and the principle she represents, voices from heaven will say, "Hallelujah!"
[110]  As we read this proclamation, what are our hearts set upon?
[111]  This passage does not say that we will reign and that we should therefore rejoice and be exceeding glad.
[112]  Neither does it say that we will receive a crown and that we should therefore praise God.
[113]  Let us turn back to Revelation 11:15: "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever."
[114]  We must remember this one thing all of our seeking and all of our growth is not for us as individuals, but for the Body.
[115]  What each member receives from God is for the whole Body.
[116]  In other words, the clothing of gold is given to us by God through the Lord Jesus, while the clothing of embroidered work is given to us by the Lord Jesus through the Holy Spirit.
[117]  No Christian can ever make a garment which is pure white.
[118]  Even if we could make one which was ninety-nine percent pure, there would still be one percent of mixture.
[119]  Verse 21:1 says, "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away, and the sea is no more."
[120]  Verse 2 continues, "And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband."
[121]  We may not know how God will do it, but we do know that the church will attain to that position at the time of the new heaven and new earth.
[122]  Revelation 21:3 says, "And I heard a loud voice out of the throne, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will tabernacle with them, and they will be His peoples, and God Himself will be with them and be their God."
[123]  Let us read again the last part of verse 3: "He will tabernacle with them, and they will be His peoples, and God Himself will be with them and be their God."
[124]  What does it really mean for us to be the people of God?
[125]  It means that God will dwell with us, and therefore, we will be made His people.
[126]  When we are away from His presence, God cannot be our God.
[127]  The greatest and highest blessing in eternity is that God will be with us and be our God.
[128]  We acknowledge that Satan's work has indeed interrupted the work of God, but we further acknowledge that God is not only the Alpha who purposed in the beginning, but also the Omega who will finally succeed.
[129]  Now let us see the details of the holy city, the New Jerusalem.
[130]  Revelation 21:9-10 says, "And one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and spoke with me, saying, Come here; I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.
[131]  And he carried me away in spirit onto a great and high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God."
[132]  Men today can behold high church buildings, they can take part in well-prepared Sunday services, and they can admire the ability of man, but in the sight of God, everything that has its origin in Babylon is in the wilderness; it is deserted.
[133]  If we are not standing spiritually on a high mountain, we will not see those who are living on the plain, we will not see the New Jerusalem, nor will we see the ultimate work of God.
[134]  How we thank God that on one hand we were purchased with the precious blood of the Lord, and on the other hand, we were truly born of God.
[135]  From the standpoint of our history with sin, we were outwardly purchased; but from the standpoint of our history apart from sin, we were born of God, for whoever is born of God cannot sin.
[136]  This is not to say that we did not come to God as sinners, but that there is a portion in us which is from God and is entirely of God.
[137]  Revelation 21:11 describes this city as "having the glory of God.
[138]  Isaac's birth represents gold, but Jacob's experience represents precious stone.
[139]  Isaac was born a son through the promise of God.
[140]  That life which God has imparted to us is the gold, while the life which God is constituting in us is the precious stone.
[141]  God does not stop by just giving us a portion of Christ's life; He wants to have the life of Christ wrought into us.
[142]  At this point we must realize how useless it is to put our emphasis merely on doctrine.
[143]  We must never think that we will benefit if we only know a little more theology or scriptural teaching.
[144]  This does not mean that we should not read our Bible, but it does mean that what we read is of value only when the Holy Spirit burns it into us.
[145]  God has not only given us His life, but He is also working in us to the extent that we may possess a special quality.
[146]  In eternity God did not plan to have silver, because silver represents redemption.
[147]  God knew that men would sin and need redemption, but this was not something of His eternal plan.
[148]  In God's work there is redemption, but in His eternal purpose there is no redemption.
[149]  Thank God that although we have sinned, the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from every sin.
[150]  We must see that the fall is not in the purpose of God, redemption is not in the purpose of God, and neither is the kingdom something in the purpose of God.
[151]  Verse 22 says, "And I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple."
[152]  Whenever man wanted to have fellowship with God at that time, he had to go to the temple.
[153]  The temple was the place set aside for God, and it was to that place that man had to go for fellowship with God.
[154]  THE RIVER OF WATER OF LIFE AND THE TREE OF LIFE
[155]  We have yet to see what God will show us at the end. Verses 22:1-2 say, "And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street.
[156]  Here we are reminded of verse 2:7, which says, "To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God."
[157]  Since the tree of life is in the city, this tells us that the New Jerusalem is the Paradise of God.
[158]  Recalling the book of Genesis, God created man as a type of Christ and the woman as a type of the church he desired to obtain in Genesis 2.
[159]  Verse 3 says, "And there will no longer be a curse."
[160]  Thank God, Genesis 3 will completely pass away and there will no longer be a curse.
[161]  May God save us and deliver us from any kind of service which does not issue from fellowship and which is not in fellowship, and may He enable us to remain in fellowship even after we have finished the work.
[162]  THE VISION OF THE GLORIOUS CHRIST Scripture Reading: Rev 1:9-20
[163]  "The revelation of Jesus Christ" means that this revelation is of Jesus Christ, through Jesus Christ, and concerning Jesus Christ.
[164]  Verse 10 says, "I was in spirit on the Lord's Day and heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet."
[165]  The Lord's Day here refers to the first of seven days.
[166]  "In the midst of the lampstands One like the Son of Man" indicates that the Lord's presence is with His church Rev 1:13 .
[167]  Revelation 1:14-15 says, "And His head and hair were as white as white wool, as snow; and His eyes were like a flame of fire; and His feet were like shining bronze, as having been fired in a furnace; and His voice was like the sound of many waters."
[168]  Not only does the Lord's dress reveal the nature of His judgment, but His own expression also reveals it.
[169]  Revelation 1:16 says, "And He had in His right hand seven stars; and out of His mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword; and His face shone as the sun shines in its power."
[170]  We have seen the holiness and majesty of the Lord who resembles the Son of Man.
[171]  What did the prophet Habakkuk do when he heard the voice of Jehovah?
[172]  He said: "I heard and my body trembled;/My lips quivered at the sound./Rottenness entered my bones, /And I tremble in my place" Hab 3:16 .
[173]  If we have truly seen the glory of the Lord, the holiness of the Lord, even the judgment of the Lord, we will deeply abhor and hate ourselves.
[174]  When he was thrown into the lion's den, God sealed up the mouth of the lions, and they did not hurt him v. 22 . George M ller said, "If you walk with God and look to Him for your constant help, the living God will guarantee that He will not fail you.
[175]  Revelation 1:19-20 says, "Write therefore the things which you have seen and the things which are and the things which are about to take place after these things.
[176]  The mystery of the seven stars which you saw upon My right hand and the seven golden lampstands: The seven stars are the messengers of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches."
[177]  The Lord wanted John to "write therefore the things which you have seen and the things which are and the things which are about to take place after these things" because He wanted to secure a written testimony.
[178]  He rebuked the church in Thyatira, saying, "You tolerate the woman Jezebel, she who calls herself a prophetess and teaches and leads My slaves astray to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices" v. 20 . He reminded the church in Sardis, saying, "Become watchful and establish the things which remain....If therefore you will not watch, I will come as a thief, and you shall by no means know at what hour I will come upon you" 3:2-3 . He encouraged the church in Philadelphia, saying, "Hold fast what you have" v. 11 . He exhorted the church in Laodicea, saying, "I counsel you to buy from Me gold refined by fire...and white garments that you may be clothed...and eyesalve to anoint your eyes that you may see" v. 18 . The above words were spoken by the Lord to the churches 1:11; 2:7 . Yet the letters were written to the messengers of the churches.
[179]  This means they possess a heavenly position and experience like the stars in the heavens.
[180]  They testify for the Lord and shine for the Lord like the stars at night.
