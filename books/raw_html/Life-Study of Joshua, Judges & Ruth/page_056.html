<h2 class="head2">I. On the Second Day the Children of Israel<br />
Going to Fight with the Children of Benjamin</h2>
<p>On the second day the children of Israel went to fight with the children of Benjamin, who slew another eighteen thousand men among the children of Israel (vv. 24-25).</p>
<h2 class="head2">J. All the Children of Israel<br />
Going Up to Bethel and Weeping before Jehovah</h2>
<p>All the children of Israel went up to Bethel and wept before Jehovah, fasting until the evening and offering burnt offerings and peace offerings before Jehovah. They inquired of Jehovah, saying, &ldquo;Shall I again go out into battle with the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease?&rdquo; Jehovah answered, &ldquo;Go up, for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hand&rdquo; (vv. 26-28).</p>
<h2 class="head2">K. The Children of Israel Going Up<br />
against the Children of Benjamin<br />
on the Third Day</h2>
<p>The children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day and set themselves in array against Gibeah as at other times. First, the children of Benjamin slew about thirty men of Israel. Then the children of Israel destroyed twenty-five thousand one hundred men of Benjamin, by Jehovah striking them down before Israel (vv. 29-35).</p>
<h2 class="head2">L. The Ambush of Israel<br />
Hurrying and Rushing against Gibeah<br />
and Slaying the Whole City</h2>
<p>The ambush of Israel hurried and rushed against Gibeah and slew the whole city (even though about thirty men were slain by the children of Benjamin) and burned the city. Then the children of Benjamin turned before the men of Israel toward the wilderness, but the children of Israel overtook them and killed twenty-five thousand of them on that day (vv. 36-46).</p>
<h2 class="head2">M. Six Hundred Men of the Children of Benjamin<br />
Turning and Fleeing into the Wilderness</h2>
<p>Six hundred men of the children of Benjamin turned and fled into the wilderness. The men of Israel returned to the children of Benjamin, striking them, both the entire city with the cattle and all that was found there. Moreover, all the cities that were found they set on fire (vv. 47-48).</p>
<h2 class="head2">N. The Children of Israel Being Grieved<br />
concerning Benjamin Their Brother</h2>
<p>The children of Israel were grieved concerning Benjamin their brother that one tribe had been cut down from Israel (21:1-6, 15).</p>
<h2 class="head2">O. The Children of Israel<br />
Planning to Get Wives and Possessions<br />
for the Remnant of Benjamin</h2>
<p>In verses 7 through 24 we see that the children of Israel planned to get wives and possessions for the remnant of Benjamin. They sent twelve thousand of the valiant to destroy the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead. These captured four hundred young virgins to be wives of the Benjaminites (vv. 7-14). In addition to this, the elders of the assembly commanded the Benjaminites to catch the daughters of Shiloh to be their wives, and the children of Benjamin did so (vv. 16-23a). Then the Benjaminites went and dwelt in their inheritance and they rebuilt the cities and dwelt in them (v. 23b).</p>
<h2 class="head2">P. In Those Days There Being No King in Israel,<br />
and Each Man Doing<br />
What Was Right in His Own Eyes</h2>
<p>The book of Judges concludes by saying that in those days there was no king in Israel; each man did what was right in his own eyes (v. 25).</p>
