   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE TRUTH LEADING TO GODLINESS Scripture Reading: John 1:17; 14:6; 17:17; 1 Tim 3:15-16; 4:3b, 7-8; 2 Tim 2:15; 3:8; 4:4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In John 14:6 the Lord said, I am the way and the reality and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Greek word for reality in this verse may also be translated as truth cf.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>17:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We first experience Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This life experienced by us becomes our reality, and this reality is the way for us to do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The proper way to live, work, serve, and worship is the reality, the truth, which we have through the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We saw in the previous chapter that the way to preach the gospel is to experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The way for us to preach the gospel is not the demonstration of natural ability or the use of gimmicks, such as plays or musical performances.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The unique and living way to preach the gospel is simply to live Christ, grow Christ, and produce Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>REALITY BEING A PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>John 1:17 says, The law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Truth, or reality, is not doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This verse would not make sense if the word doctrine were used in place of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this verse the apostle John places the law in contrast to reality, or truth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The law being given indicates that it is not a person, and reality coming indicates that it is a person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The law was a shadow, a type, a prefigure, or a picture; the truth is the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If I intend to visit some people who have never seen me, I may send them my photograph before I arrive.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, the photograph is given, but the person comes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Old Testament is called the Law and the Prophets Matt 22:40 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before Christ came, God gave many pictures of Christ in the books of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, seeing pictures cannot substitute for meeting the real person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, we must not stop with the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the New Testament we have the person, Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The person came, and now He is present, new, and living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have an active and energizing person living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This person is the reality of every positive thing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Genesis 1:26 God said, Let Us make man in Our image.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Man being made in God s image is a shadow, a picture.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Man was made in God s image, but the real image of God is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the image of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, Christ is seen in Genesis 1 in a shadow.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The body of the shadow, the One who is the image of the invisible God, came in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ came as the image of the invisible God, the tangible expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>John 1:18 says, No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ is the expression of the unseen God, the image of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The picture of God s image is in Genesis 1, but the person who is the real image of God is in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The tree of life in Genesis 2 also is a picture of Christ as the real tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>John 1:4 says, In Him was life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In 11:25 and 14:6 the Lord said that He is the life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then in 15:1 He said, I am the true vine.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All other vines are shadows; Christ is the real vine.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>John reveals that Christ is life and the true vine.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This indicates that Christ is the reality of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is for this reason that John 1:17 says, Reality came through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Genesis 3 Adam and Eve fell and were poisoned by the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then God came in to judge the serpent, telling him, I will put enmity / Between you and the woman / And between your seed and her seed; / He will bruise you on the head v. 15 . The seed of the woman mentioned here is a shadow.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The reality of the seed of the woman is the child brought forth by a virgin Matt 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Galatians 4:4 says, When the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ is the seed of the woman, who bruised the head of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, the shadow, the picture, was presented in Genesis 3, and the reality, the person, came in Galatians 4.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Old Testament is a book of shadows and pictures, and the New Testament is a book of fulfillment, reality, and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This truth is a person.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In Exodus 12 the children of Israel killed and ate a lamb, and its blood was applied to their doorposts.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This caused God to pass over the children of Israel and strengthened them to make an exodus out of Egypt to a place to which God had called them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All this was a shadow.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the New Testament, when John the Baptist saw the Lord, he said, Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The lamb in Exodus 12 was a shadow, a picture; Christ is the Lamb of God in reality.</S>
