   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE SPIRIT OF PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture reading:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John 4:24: "God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jude 20: "praying in the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Ephesians 6:18: "praying in spirit "</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Romans 8:26: "the Spirit Himself intercedes for us " I. PRAYER MUST BE IN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We know that the existence and operation of the universe and everything in it is governed by laws.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we want to do anything effectively we must keep the particular laws of that thing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Concerning prayer, there is an iron-clad law: prayer must be in spirit; for in praying you pray to God, and God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you pray in the mind, emotion, or will, but not in spirit, you cannot touch God nor pray into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These faculties cannot get you through to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to touch God and pray into Him, we must pray in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is when the Holy Spirit utters prayers in and with our spirit that we can touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even a sinner who repents and prays to the Lord after hearing the gospel must pray from his spirit in order to touch God and be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Until that time he is not yet regenerated, and his spirit is still not quickened; but when the Holy Spirit moves him, enlightens his conscience, and causes him to repent, he prays from his enlightened conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since the conscience constitutes a major part of the spirit, a prayer that comes out from the conscience is a prayer that comes out from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Having been enlightened by God as well as touched by the Holy Spirit, the conscience is convicted of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The cry that issues from such a condemning conscience is, no doubt, a prayer in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, such prayer can contact God, and there is an echo within us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, there are some who pray when they first hear the gospel, yet there is no response.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They have heard some doctrine, received some instruction mentally, and have made a confession before God according to their mind, but their conscience remained untouched.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Such prayer cannot touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As the children of God who have been regenerated and have the Holy Spirit dwelling within, our prayers must be in spirit to touch God and be answered.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the first point about which we should be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>PRAYER REQUIRES THE EXERCISING OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since prayer should be in spirit, it requires the exercising of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One who never exercises his spirit does not know how to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For example, a runner must exercise his legs in order to run.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A boxer exercises to concentrate the strength of his whole being into his fists.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Those learning a language must train their tongue if they would speak that language.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Learning to speak Mandarin is difficult because of the sounds which require rolling the tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is difficult not only for foreigners, but also for those from the southern regions of China.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, whatever we do, we need to train the faculty involved.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Likewise, if we want to pray, we must exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If someone cannot pray well and is not willing to pray, it must be because his praying faculty lacks exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whenever an organ lacks exercise it ceases to function properly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Medical doctors tell us that if we cover the eyes from light for three years, when the cover is removed the eyes will not be able to see anything.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although the rest of the body may be strong, the eyes will have lost their function after such a long period of non-exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One time an illness forced me to take complete bed rest for six continuous months.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After I recovered, I got out of bed and, to my surprise, fell to the floor.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I found myself unable to stand or walk.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I then realized that since my legs and feet had not been used for six months, they had lost the ability to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, I had to learn how to stand, and then, after a long period of exercise, I was able to walk again.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although you have the legs and feet, the organs for walking, they are useless unless they have been exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Similarly, the spirit is the organ for praying.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In order to pray we need to exercise the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Never consider that since we have a spirit, then surely we can pray competently.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The fact is, unless our spirit has gone through some exercise we cannot pray and we will not enjoy praying.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The less we practice something, the less we enjoy doing it, and the less we are able to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, if someone does not pray regularly and you ask him to pray, it is really a hardship for him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is not because he has a lazy disposition; rather, it is that his spirit is lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To people who cannot walk well it is a real suffering if you compel them to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the other hand, those who really enjoy walking will eagerly accept an invitation to walk somewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is because their legs are very strong and agile from exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some brothers and sisters have a spirit of prayer that is very strong and agile.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Before you finish mentioning a matter, such a person will have begun to pray in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But there are some whose spirit of prayer is very lazy because they do not ordinarily use their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some are very strong-willed, so that when they encounter something it is not their spirit but their will that comes first.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Others are very emotional, so that when something happens their emotion takes the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>With others who are sober-minded and very quick to think, their mind takes the lead in any situation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But all who learn how to pray must exercise themselves to let the spirit dominate in every situation and not allow their mind, will, or emotion to take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We need to train ourselves so that whenever we encounter some problem we can exercise our spirit immediately.</S>
