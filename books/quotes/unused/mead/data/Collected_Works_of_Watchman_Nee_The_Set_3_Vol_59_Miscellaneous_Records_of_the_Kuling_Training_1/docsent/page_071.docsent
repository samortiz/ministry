   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY THE CONDITION FOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING AN AUTHORITY SUBMISSION Date: July 3, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place: Kuling Mountain</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The condition for knowing God's authority is submission, and the result of knowing His authority is also submission.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The more we are obedient, the more we will see God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God's requirement for His appointed authority is submission.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Those who cannot submit to authority will never be chosen by God to be an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the Lord was on earth, He praised only one Gentile the centurion Matt 8:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Other than him, He hardly recommended anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The centurion was praised because he knew authority; he had learned the meaning of faith from his understanding of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He knew that authority was in the Lord's word; he knew the meaning of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He said, "For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me" v. 9 . The centurion knew that he had authority above him, that he was a man under authority.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He also was aware of being an authority to his subordinates.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Perhaps it is too early for us to speak of authority today.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The authority which the church possesses today is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must wait for the kingdom to come before we will possess actual authority.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The full manifestation will come in the next age.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then the glory, the kingdom, and the authority will all be Christ's. Today is not the time for the church to reign; this is only a time of training and preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Dispensationally speaking, it is too early to speak of authority today.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, we have ground to speak about authority today because God has appointed deputy authority in the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A servant of the Lord must come to know authority and submission.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If a man has never seen the matter of authority, he can never submit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the other hand, if a man does not have the experience of submission, he can never be an authority.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>SUBMISSION TO DEPUTY AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>BEING SUBMISSION TO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I hope that those who are learning to be an authority will not have a wrong concept: In leading those who, under God's sovereignty, are under them, they should not try to lead them to submit to them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead, they should lead them to submit to God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They should not try to lead someone to meet men, but to meet God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If a man only meets men, he still does not know the meaning of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those who have never met God are not submitting to God, but to men only.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Actually, a person who has never touched God's authority will never submit to men.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In God's sovereignty and according to the order of His authority, some people are placed under us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we are the deputy authority to them, we have to realize that we are not asking submission for ourselves; we are leading them to submit to God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is a great mistake for anyone to expect others to submit to himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God has no intention to uphold your own dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He has no intention for wives, children, and slaves to just submit to their husbands, fathers, and masters.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God's intention is for man to submit to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The submission which God requires from man is the same in nature as the path which He has designated for man; it is submission to God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are not here to maintain our own dignity or position.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are not here to carry out our own order, but to execute God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we demand that others submit to us, we are merely leading them to touch ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we are under the illusion that authority means for others to submit to us, we need to go back to the very basics in our training.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A deputy authority is merely a temporary appointment from God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We submit to a certain person because he represents God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we rebel against him, we are offending God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For example, a few brothers from Shangtung once came to our meeting in Yu-Hua-Chun Editor's note: a training center in Shanghai .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I spoke to them about submission to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At that time I did not have the liberty to say too much.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When they heard it, they tried to practice submission.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But when they returned to Chefoo, they would not submit to Brother Witness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These ones only touched men.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we have touched only men, but not touched God's authority, we do not know authority.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Those who have seen God's authority will find authority wherever they go.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In our submission, we must meet God Himself, not just men.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Suppose we teach a child in Foochow about electricity and let him touch a bare wire.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He will feel the shock from the current.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If he goes to Shanghai and tries to touch electricity there, he will feel the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This will teach him not to meddle with electricity carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If he has only touched an insulated wire, however, he has not experienced electricity itself.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He may find an electrified wire with black or yellow insulation and play with it out of curiosity.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In real life, of course, the result still could be tragic.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We are not here to teach men to touch the insulation around the electrical wire, but to help them to touch electricity itself.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We have to help people to know authority, not the figures who represent authority.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Unless we give them this proper help, we are sending them to certain disaster.</S>
