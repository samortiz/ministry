   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our national life is not in any earthly country; it is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our real citizenship, our true commonwealth, is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, we are not earthly citizens or worldly citizens we are heavenly citizens.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because our citizenship is in the heavens, we should not be occupied with earthly things, with the physical things needed for our existence.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should not place such a high value on material things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This does not mean, of course, that we should not have proper food, clothing, housing, and transportation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need these things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But if we love the earthly things needed for human life, this is an indication that we do not treasure our heavenly citizenship.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all need to remember that our citizenship is in the heavens and that we are a heavenly people sojourning on earth. a. As Partakers of the Heavenly Calling</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everything in it has a heavenly nature.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We, the believers in Christ, are partakers of such a heavenly calling.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The heavenly calling first calls us to the heavenly Christ Heb 1:3, 13; 4:14; 6:20; 7:26; 9:24; 10:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ was on earth and He will return to earth, but He is now in the heavens.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As partakers of the heavenly calling, we have had our names enrolled in the heavens Heb 12:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today we are not in the heavens, but our names are written there.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We also taste the heavenly gift Heb 6:4 , have the heavenly worship Heb 8:5; 9:23-24 , and come to the heavenly Jerusalem Heb 12:22 .</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The word "heavenlies" is rather peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It refers not only to a place but also to an atmosphere with a certain nature and characteristic.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God's salvation by life has brought us into a heavenly place and into a heavenly atmosphere with a heavenly characteristic.</S>

   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to Ephesians 2:6, it was in Christ that God seated us all together, once for all, in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This was accomplished when Christ ascended to the heavens, and it was applied to us by the Spirit of Christ when we believed in Him.</S>

   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to set our mind on these things.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This means that we need to forget earthly things culture, religion, philosophy, and natural human virtues and instead lift up our eyes to the heavens and set our mind on the wonderful, excellent things, the things that are above.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>These things can cause us to be transformed, for they transmit a heavenly element into us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, we need to open our spirit and our whole being to the heavens that the divine transmission may flow into us unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then the riches of Christ in His heavenly ministry will be transmitted into us, and we shall be transformed and constituted of Christ.</S>
