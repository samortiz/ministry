<h2 class="head1">HOW TO DEAL WITH TRIALS</h2><p>Sometimes you encounter not only temptations, but also trials. Suppose a sister's husband persecutes her and does not allow her to come to the meetings. The way to deal with such a trial is by faith. If faith is genuine, an intense fire will only prove its golden nature; the fire will not turn it into bronze. All genuine faith is long-lived. Whenever you encounter any trial, do not be discouraged and do not retreat. On the contrary, stand on God's Word and believe that God will manifest His victory through you.</p><p>When I was in Chefoo, Brother Witness Lee's wife came to see me once and said, "I have passed the gate of victory. But my victory is very short; it only lasts for a week. After a few days, I am defeated again. What is happening to me?" I gave her an illustration. I said, "Suppose your child is playing outside your house and a rickshaw driver comes and says to him, `Your mother bought you from the herbal shop.' Your child will come home and ask, `Was I born of you, or was I bought by you?' You will say, `You were born of me. Do not believe the word of a stranger.' Your child may go out and meet the same man again, who says, `You are silly. Your mother has deceived you. You were bought and not born of your mother. I was there when she bought you.' The rickshaw driver may repeat again and again that your son was not born of you. He may even present two or three witnesses to your child. Will your child believe your words, which do not have any proof, or the stranger's lies, which are apparently backed up by proof? If your son has faith in your word, he will be very bold. He will ignore the lies of the strangers, and he will even laugh at them in his heart and say, `You are liars. You are just trying to deceive me. The more you speak to me, the more I do not believe.' In the same way, we believe in God's Word and do not need any proof. Whatever God's Word says, that is it. My feelings are lies, and my experiences are lies. I only believe that God's Word is true. If we can believe firmly in God's Word, we can even say, `I wish more trials can come. Let them come. See whether or not I am nervous about them!'"</p><p>Once another brother named Lee testified that he lives a life of sitting at the bow of the boat. He can look down upon all the temptations and scorn all the trials, because the Lord is sleeping at the stern of the boat. Those who have faith will have such a confidence. Yet this will not guarantee that we will never fail. It is still possible for us to fail. Once we fail, we have to confess our sins immediately and repent to Him, asking for the cleansing of His blood. Then we have to return to the proper path and live the overcoming life once again. When we do this, the way of victory will shine brighter and brighter.</p><h2 class="head1">VICTORY BEING PERFECT IN NATURE<br />WHILE THE EXPERIENCE OF VICTORY<br />BEING PROGRESSIVE</h2><p>Question: Is victory something progressive, or is it something that we experience once for all?</p><p>Answer: It is right to say that it is progressive, but it is not wrong to say that it is complete once for all. In terms of God living in us and overcoming sins for us, we can say that victory is complete once for all. However, there is a difference in degree. There is a difference in the amount God fills a person. For example, a cup, a bowl, and a bucket can all be filled, but the measures are different. Every believer can only overcome the sins that he knows about; he cannot overcome sins that he does not know about. For example, last year you might not have known that a certain matter was a sin. Obviously, you could not have overcome it then. When God enlightens you this year, you will know that it is sin, and you can overcome it. The light you receive is progressive. Therefore, the victory you experience is also progressive. The victory that a newly saved person experiences is the same kind of victory that is experienced by one who has been a Christian for forty to fifty years. But the latter has experienced victory in greater frequency and degree. Hence, in order to live the overcoming life, we must learn daily to know sin and the things that do not glorify God. If we do this, we will advance day by day.</p><p>I have a friend who is a missionary with the China Inland Mission. She was familiar with the overcoming life. She had a colleague who always gave her a hard time, spreading many unfounded rumors about her in England. All the co-workers disliked this one, but my friend endured her and outwardly maintained a cordial relationship with her. One day my friend read 1 Peter 1:22, which says, "Love one another from a pure heart fervently." God shed His light on her and showed her that not only is hatred a sin, but the failure to love one's brother is also a sin. She prayed and said, "Lord, make me love her. There is nothing lovable about her. She is not lovable at all. In fact, she is horrible. Lord, I can forgive her, but I cannot love her. I cannot love her fervently. I confess that this is a sin." For two to three days, her attention was on this new sin. One day she prayed and fasted the whole day, but still she could not love the sister. She prayed earnestly for another day and night. The next evening the Lord granted her the victory. She felt that she not only loved this sister fervently, but that she could even pray for her. Thank the Lord, after another week the co-worker who gave her a hard time also overcame and received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. After we pass the gate of victory, there may still be warfare, but the warfare we experience after passing the gate of victory is a warfare of faith. In the world one fights to win, but the Lord's way is to win first and then fight.</p><p>There were three Western sisters who were working in Shansi. Two of them decided to remain single, and the third was engaged. Her fiancé was in England. One day the sister who was engaged was praying in her room and felt very lonely. She began to weep and feel sorry for herself. When the second sister passed the room and saw her crying, she went to the third one and said, "If anyone should be crying, we should be the ones. She has a fiancé who writes to her all the time. Why does she have to cry?" Eventually the two were affected and began crying out of loneliness as well. A few days later the Lord reminded one of them of the word in Matthew 28:20: "I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age." The other sister read Psalm 16:11, which says, "You will make known to Me the path of life;/In Your presence is fullness of joy;/At Your right hand there are pleasures forever." They realized that even the feeling of loneliness was a new sin, and they prayed, "Lord, forgive us. You are with us all the time. Yet we feel lonely. This is a sin." After this they overcame. From that time forward, they never wept for their loneliness.</p><p>One sister had five children. She was a very good sister, but she worried for her children all the time. At first she even thought that it was right to worry; she did not see that worrying is a sin. Therefore, she did not overcome. One day the Lord enlightened her, and she realized that worrying is a sin. Subsequently, she overcame. If you have the Lord living in you, the more sin you know, the more you will overcome.</p><p>I was once ill-treated by a certain person, and I said a few rash words to him. The Lord pointed out this matter to me and told me to deal with it. I thought that he had wronged me. I did not hate him anymore and I had forgiven him. Yet the Lord wanted me to confess my sins to him. I felt that I could not do this, but whenever the Lord speaks, He will not give up. Whenever the Lord lays His hand upon something, He will never take it back. I read the Bible and prayed. One day I read the phrase "love your enemies." I had written a letter apologizing to him, but when I realized that I could not love him, I did not send it out. I prayed to the Lord, "If You do not give me a love for this man, I cannot love him by myself." When I honestly confessed that I could not make it, and that God was the only One who could, I was able to love him from my heart. I had been trying to deal with the matter for two months, but it was settled that day. I sent him the letter of apology the next day.</p><p>A sister who was very neat, tidy, and kept her house in good order did not care very much about her closets. Two months ago she testified that the Lord spoke to her, "You have to clean your closets; otherwise, you cannot glorify Me." She began to clean her closets. When I heard this, I was quite touched, and the Lord immediately spoke to me, "You have not made your bed. How can this glorify Me?" I began to make my bed. Before that time I had never made my bed. That was the first time I began to make my bed. Two months have passed now, and I have been making my bed ever since. Thank and praise the Lord.</p><p>The victory in Christ is complete in its nature, and there is no way to improve on it. However, the extent and degree of victory are constantly growing and increasing. The more light we receive, the more growth we experience. The less light we receive, the less growth we experience. The more we know our sins, the more supply we receive from God; the less we know our sins, the less supply we receive from God. If every day we acknowledge before the Lord that we cannot make it, that we will not try to make it, and that only God can make it, and if every day we believe that God lives in us to be our victory, we will advance continually. Hallelujah! On the one hand, our victory is complete, because this victory is accomplished in Christ. On the other hand, our victory is progressive, because as the light we receive increases, the measure of our victory will also increase.</p>
