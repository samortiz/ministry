   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not for Uniformity but for Vitality</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We should pay attention to one thing in this new practice; that is, we should be for vitality rather than uniformity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>My grandchildren are very active and growing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whenever they come together, they create a mess, and there is no order.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When they come to visit me, I tell them ahead of time that they can stay for only ten minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They are like a demolition crew, specialists in destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They feel that they must look at whatever I have on the shelves, touch them, and sometimes kick them and even throw them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They cannot resist jumping on my sofas, and they love to hop off the back of my couches.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before they come, I insist that I be warned by telephone ahead of time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>My wife then hurriedly says, The demolition crew is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hurry and hide the glassware, the pots and pans, and the ornaments, or they will all be wrecked and torn apart.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although this is a bothersome affair, I am always happy at their coming, because every one of them is full of energy and vitality.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Let me ask the brothers and sisters here: Do we want our house to be orderly and clean yet empty and silent, or do we want the demolition crew to come?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No one likes an empty house with only two elderly people living in it; this is boring.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Everyone likes to have the demolition crew.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They are full of energy and noise.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the same principle, we should be afraid of the church lapsing into deadness, but we should not be afraid of the church becoming messy and noisy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I admit that I may be too much, but I fear that even my correction may not be strong enough.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I would rather see the matter overly corrected than not corrected at all.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I hope that none of us will exercise control.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Instead, may we only encourage.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Praying for the Lord to Do the Work,</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather Than Stretching Out Our Own Hands</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>to Do the Work</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church belongs to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church is not a law court, and it is not a police station.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In God s house we are not rulers lording over God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are slaves serving the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In doing everything we must be proper and right.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If a brother has committed a serious sin and has not come to a meeting for many years, we should not refer to his sin when we visit him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some may ask, If we do not deal with the sin, what kind of church are we?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to understand that our hands are not qualified to exercise control over others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even if we try, we cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our hands are dirty.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should never think that our hands are clean.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even if our hands are clean, we must realize that only the Lord is qualified to deal with the sinning one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we try to deal with him, we may end up in fleshly wrath after two minutes and may fall into sin ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is difficult to find a clean person.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We can only ask the Lord to do the work and allow Him to do the work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the best way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>From my youth, I learned to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When I saw some situations that I thought were wrong, I hoped that one day I could do something about them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, after a few years, I realized that I myself was not clean.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I was not pure within.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For this reason, I dared not touch those matters.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If a surgeon does not first sterilize himself and all his instruments, his surgery will create problems.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Without surgery, a patient may at least be protected from certain kinds of germs.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To have an operation in a room full of germs, with unsterilized instruments and doctors with germs on their hands, will merely aggravate the patient s condition.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Dear co-workers and elders, do not presume that it is always right to deal with the matters that stumble.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It may be right to know about them, but if we are not clean persons and our instruments have not been sterilized, we have no way to deal with these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In trying to deal with defeated and backsliding saints, some co-workers and elders have stepped into a situation without adequate knowledge of the weaknesses of the saints, and the result has been a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is better to stay away from such situations than to end up with a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As long as a person is a child of God, he has the Lord s life in him, and this life will take care of the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It will fight the germs, and the germs will be eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, if we try to operate in the dark, we will bring in harmful infections.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many times nothing happens when we do not touch a situation, but the minute we touch it, we spoil everything.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I believe we have experienced this.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord s Word Being the Main Ingredient</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>in the Home Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In short, we should not control but should stir up people in a positive way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Our most practical goal should be to stir up the saints house by house and to incite them to open up their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Let me give a few words of advice.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>First, no matter how disorganized a home meeting is and no matter how low the condition of the meeting is, we should not be discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should pray in secret and encourage in public so that the meeting can continue week after week.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It does not matter how many people show up; as long as they can meet, we should encourage it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Second, the co-workers and the elders should set the direction of the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Every home meeting should have the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>According to our experience, if we do not prepare some material, and if we do not have the Lord s word, everyone will be free to speak what he wants to, and the freedom will degenerate into confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the church in Taipei, for example, the best way is for the business office of the church to select some nourishing, enlightening, and anointed messages and make them available for use in the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The co-workers and the elders then must encourage the saints to dig into these messages and progress through them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The home meetings do not need to be formal.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Rather, they need to be living and organic.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>These meetings are prone to be somewhat disorganized.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>They may begin at seven o clock, but it may be half past eight before all the members arrive.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>After an initial period of mutual cherishing, the group can begin reading the message after half past eight.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>At least there should be twenty minutes when everyone is together to pursue the message together in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This can be compared to eating a meal.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The meal may not be a large one, but at least everyone is well fed.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Do not think that this is a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If every week or every other week the saints can gather together in such a home meeting, and everyone has the word planted into him, in time this will produce a certain kind of result.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The human body can incur some long-term illnesses that need long-term care.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The cures for these illnesses do not come quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The same can be said of the weaknesses of the saints; because they cannot be cured immediately, we should go slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Every time we see the saints, we should dispense a little of God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Every opportunity we have, we should nourish and cherish a little.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Then in time the saints will grow in a healthy way.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We cannot be impatient.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Release a word or two once a week, every week.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In the beginning we may not see much result, but over a long period of time the result will become quite obvious.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>After a few weeks of practice in the home meetings, I have observed that the home meetings in the church in Taipei are gradually getting on the right track.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>They are no longer dependent on the core members or on spiritual giants.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Every member is functioning in an organic way.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>When the saints come together, they are like a heap of coal, and the minute fire is applied, the whole meeting lights up.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Now I am concerned that although the fire is lit, there is not much of the Lord s word in them.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The gatherings generate a congenial atmosphere, but after such a meeting, not much of the Lord s word has been imparted into the attendants.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>There is no pursuit of any message, and the meeting merely goes on and on with light talk.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>This is a serious shortage of the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We should use whatever means we have to impart the Lord s word into the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>His word is the only vital ingredient for the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The Home Meeting Needing</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>to Stir Up Man s Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>In short, in leading the saints to care for the home meetings, the elders must pay attention to stirring up the spirit of every person in every home.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Do not expect to stir up every home the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Rather, work on the homes one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We are not afraid of being slow; we are afraid only of not moving at all.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>If every elder can stir up one home per week, three elders can stir up twelve homes in a month.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>After the saints spirits are stirred up, we need to teach them so that they are fed by the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Each home meeting must always render a portion of supply to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>This is a crucial matter.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We can try to accomplish this in whatever way we please, but the spirit has to be living and fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>If a message is too long, we can split it up into sections.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Some who come early can receive the supply from the first section, and some who come late can receive the supply from the second section.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Even if someone comes late and leaves early, we should still give him a portion of supply.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>We should accompany him to the door, read a portion to him, fellowship a little with him, and ask him to read the material when he gets home.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>He may not read it when he gets home, but if he does, he will receive the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>This is a very important step.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Not Coercing but Begetting,</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Nourishing, Teaching, and Building</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Another point we must pay attention to is that we should not coerce anyone or drag anyone to go along with us.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>One unfortunate effect of our changing the system is that the brothers pay too much attention to numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Every church and every meeting hall tries to compare its results with others.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>As a result, everyone is concerned about the numbers in the group meetings and how these numbers should be reckoned.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>I hope that we can all be delivered from the concern for numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>The numbers merely show us whether we are advancing or falling back, and even this is not a very accurate measurement.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>It is wrong for us to attract people from other halls or churches for the purpose of boosting our number.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>We should never do this kind of thing.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>A saint should go to a meeting that is close by his or her home.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Do not say, This person was baptized and revived in our area.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Therefore, he or she must join the meeting in our area.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>When we labor for increase and revival, we may accidentally trample on others.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>It is better that we be trampled on and others be revived.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Is it not wonderful that we die and others live?</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>We must be clear that we are here to spread the gospel and save the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>After the sinners are saved, we should nourish, care for, teach, and perfect them.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>This is our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>If we are focused on this goal, we will not carefully bargain about everything but will generously give our new ones away.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>Concerning the new ones, we need to prepare some material at the suitable time to lead them to know the church.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>We need to show them what the church is, and we need to help them to realize the importance of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>Our old concept tells us that if a person does not come to the big meetings and does not attend the Lord s table meeting, he is not a part of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>We must drop this concept.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>Those who are a part of the church are those who have the Lord s life.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>As long as a person possesses the Lord s life, he is a part of the church, and we must receive him.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>CHANGING THE SYSTEM FIRST INVOLVING</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>A CHANGE OF CONCEPT</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>We need to change our concept entirely.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>We should not seek a regimented, grand, or spectacular fa ade.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>In fact, we should not pay attention to the fa ade at all.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>Rather, we should pay attention to something practical.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>We need to pay attention to every home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>We should put our hope in every saint having meetings in his home.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>If we do this, everyone among us, whether he is burning or cold, strong or weak, young or old, will have the opportunity to be stirred up and to develop and fulfill his organic function in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>The Lord s recovery will then be a nation of a fighting army, and there will be continual growth and increase.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>However, if we hold on to our old concepts, many saints will be quenched from functioning in an organic way through our demand for uniformity.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>I hope that we can thoroughly change our concept and that we can practice everything properly and absolutely according to the pattern of the new way.</S>
