   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN JESUS BEING OUR SAVIOR Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 2:24; 3:18; 2 Cor 5:21; Isa 53:5-6, 10; 1 Pet 1:13; Rom 6:6; Gal 2:20</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous chapter we covered who the Lord Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we will see what the Lord Jesus has done for us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord Jesus is God becoming a man to be our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since He is our Savior, He has delivered us from a threefold problem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to know what the Lord Jesus has done for us, we must have a clear picture of this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>MAN S THREEFOLD PROBLEM Man s Outward Behavior Being Improper</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we begin to consider our threefold problem, it is easy to realize that our behavior is improper.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The primary reason that we express our need for God is that we want to be saved from our improper behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are all improper to some degree.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is no difference between a robber or a gentleman, because everyone has stolen from others or taken advantage of others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Once I was preaching the gospel and speaking about stealing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the audience there was a young boy who was in junior high school.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When he heard this word, he disagreed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He shook his head and inwardly argued, saying, Others may have stolen, but I am from a well-disciplined family, and I have never stolen anything.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Spirit was upon me during my preaching, and I pointed my finger at him and said, Even though you say that you have never stolen anything, you stole a piece of chalk from school and took it home.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even though he had actually stolen a piece of chalk, he reasoned within himself that this did not matter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I continued to speak, saying, You took the chalk home and drew circles on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When he heard this word, he began to shake in his seat because he was shocked that I knew these things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Actually, I did not know; it was God, the One who searches man s heart, who knew.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Similar things happened in England to a famous evangelist, Dr. F. B. Meyer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One day when he was preaching, he pointed into the audience and said, Look at yourself, young man!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You have stolen three pounds and eighteen shillings from your master.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you do not repay these three pounds and eighteen shillings, you will never have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Indeed, there was a young man sitting in front of him who had stolen three pounds and eighteen shillings from his employer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When he heard this word, he was very frightened because he thought that only he knew about his theft.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yet, to his surprise, Dr. Meyer pointed out the sin that he had committed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The young man had no peace when he returned home, and three pounds and eighteen shillings filled his mind as he was lying on his bed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When he woke up from his sleep, three pounds and eighteen shillings was still ringing in his ears.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He knew that if he did not return this exact amount, he would never have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then he wrote a check for three pounds and eighteen shillings and put it in his pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On that very day it so happened that a believer invited the young man to have dinner with him and Dr. Meyer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This was quite marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After dinner the young man said to the believer who invited him, Yesterday, Dr. Meyer pointed out my offense.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even though I have written a check for three pounds and eighteen shillings, I have been childish and reluctant to mail it, but as soon as I saw Dr. Meyer, I had no peace to eat this meal.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now I want to put this check in an envelope, seal it before him, and mail it to my employer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This shows that no one should consider himself to be absolutely proper.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the Spirit shines on us, we will see our darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There was a famous Chinese evangelist named John Sung.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One day as he was preaching the gospel in Hankow, he pointed to a young lady in the audience and said, You concubine.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>She became quite scared because she was indeed a concubine.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There were probably over a thousand people there that day.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Dr. Sung did not know who she was, and yet he pointed his finger at her in the audience.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After leaving the meeting, she cursed Dr. Sung and was also angry with the person who had brought her to hear the sermon.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>She said, What bad luck!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Why did you bring me here to be scolded in front of everyone?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>She was very angry, but the angrier she became, the more the Holy Spirit worked in her.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Holy Spirit convicted her that she did not fear God even though she was committing sin.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>She ceased her cursing and was convicted of her need to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then she knelt down and prayed, confessing in tears that she was a sinner, and she was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I know of many such gospel stories.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Seven or eight years ago I went to Amoy to preach the gospel, and I spoke about the Samaritan woman who met the Lord Jesus by the well in Sychar in John 4.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When she came to draw water, the Lord Jesus asked her to give Him a drink v. 7 , and He said, If you knew the gift of God and who it is who says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water v. 10 . Then she asked the Lord for this water.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although the Lord was moved with compassion, He also knew about her sinful life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Nevertheless, He did not rebuke her; rather, He gently said, Go, call your husband and come here v. 16 . She tried to cover her sin by saying, I do not have a husband v. 17 . She spoke the truth, but her intention was to deceive.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, the Lord Jesus also knew her true situation and said, You have well said, I do not have a husband, for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband; this you have said truly vv.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This woman had one husband after another, and the man she was currently with was not even her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This shows that we are born dissatisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The woman at the well was not satisfied with her first husband, and so she changed husbands repeatedly.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Her history of going from one man to another was an expression of her dissoluteness.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Her actions were similar to a person who continually drinks because his thirst cannot be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>While I was preaching, there was a friend of a sister in the audience.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When the friend heard this word, her face turned red, and she glared at the sister beside her.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Although the sister s friend had not changed husbands six times, she had changed four times.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Consequently, she turned to the sister and angrily said, You have told my story to this Mr. Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>She thought that I was speaking about this matter because the sister had told me.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The sister replied, I have never told Mr. Lee anything about you.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He was merely telling a story from the Gospel of John in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In our preaching of the gospel, we encounter many situations such as this.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Since man s behavior is improper, it cannot escape the light of God s examination.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When God examines us, everyone has a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We should carefully consider our improper ways.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Our words are improper, our actions are improper, our thoughts are improper, and our attitudes are improper.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Every aspect of our behavior is improper.</S>
