 <h2 class="head2">This Organism of the Triune God<br />
Being the Organic Body of Christ,<br />
Constituted with His Many Brothers<br />
as the Many Members of His Organic Body</h2>
<p>This organism of the Triune God is the organic Body of Christ constituted with His many brothers as the many members of His organic Body (Eph. 1:22-23; Rom. 12:5). The intrinsic essence of the church as the organic Body of Christ is the Triune God. It is by this intrinsic essence that the church can be held together as one. Our oneness is not in agreeing with one another&rsquo;s doctrines. Our oneness is the processed and dispensing Triune God. Hallelujah for this oneness! If we have any problems with one another, it is because we have departed from the intrinsic essence, the processed and dispensing Triune God. If we stay with Him, forgetting all the different doctrines, there will be no problems.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ORGANIC EXISTENCE OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Existing in the Universe<br />
as the One Universal Church of God<br />
for His Universal Expression, the Fullness of God</h2>
<p>The church exists in the universe as the one universal church of God for His universal expression, the fullness of God (1 Cor. 10:32; 12:28; Eph. 3:19b). Even the existence of the church is organic. Where the Triune God is, this living, organic church is, because this church is now one with the processed and dispensing Triune God. The church and the processed and dispensing Triune God are not two entities; they have become one entity. It is impossible for such a church to be divided.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Spreading in Many Localities on the Earth<br />
as Many Local Churches to Be<br />
His Local Expressions</h2>
<p>The church is spreading in many localities on the earth as many local churches to be His local expressions (Rev. 1:4a; 11). Universally, the church exists in the universe. Locally, this church is expressed in many localities as local churches. To say that all the local expressions should be different from one another is a wrong teaching. This kind of erroneous teaching comes from not seeing that the churches are organic, with an intrinsic essence. Does the church in Anaheim have a particular, intrinsic essence different from the church in another locality? This is impossible! In the time of Peter and Paul, every local church had the same one intrinsic essence. All the local churches on the earth today also have only one intrinsic essence, so the church cannot be divided, or split.</p>
<p>Not only the universal church but also the local churches are one. They are intrinsically one in the processed and dispensing Triune God. To solve our problems today, we must come back to the intrinsic essence of the church. If today we all limit ourselves to the one intrinsic essence of the church, every problem will be solved. To talk about whether all the churches are one or separate is to talk in darkness. This is talk without a vision of the intrinsic essence of the church. This chapter should be used by the Lord to &ldquo;open the window&rdquo; for us to look into and see the very intrinsic essence of the church and all the churches.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 12:28 Paul says, &ldquo;And God has placed some in the church: firstly apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues.&rdquo; First, God placed the apostles, who are universal in function. Second, He placed the prophets, who are not just universal in function because prophets were a part of the church in Antioch (Acts 13:1). Third, He placed teachers, who were also present locally in Antioch (Acts 13:1). &ldquo;Helps&rdquo; refers to the serving ones, the deacons, who help the saints in a local church, and &ldquo;administrations&rdquo; refers to the management of the elders in a local church. In 1 Corinthians 12:28, Paul puts apostles (who are universal), prophets and teachers (who are both universal and local), and deacons and elders (who are local) all together. This means the word &ldquo;church&rdquo; in this verse implies the universal church and all the local churches.</p>
