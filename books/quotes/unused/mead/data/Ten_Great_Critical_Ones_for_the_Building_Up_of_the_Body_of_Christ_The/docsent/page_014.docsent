   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After the church was established and became degraded, as the life-giving and compound Spirit, He became the seven Spirits of God; that is, He is the one life-giving, compound Spirit but is intensified sevenfold Rev 1:4; 4:5; 5:6 .</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Spirit also seals the believers with all that Christ is and all that He has accomplished, obtained, and attained, thus dispensing all the divine elements of Christ into the very being of the believers until they will be redeemed in their body, that is, transfigured to be like the glorious body of Christ Eph 1:13; 4:30; 2 Cor 1:22; Rom 8:23; Phil 3:21 .</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As the dispenser of what God is in Christ as grace to the believers, He dispenses the reality of God as grace to them Heb 10:29 .</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE SPIRIT OF POWER</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As the Spirit of power, He was poured upon the believers by the Christ in ascension as the violent wind to be the power to fill them outwardly for their spreading of the gospel of Christ Acts 2:2-4, 17-18, 33; 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First, Christ breathed this Spirit as the gentle breath into the disciples to be the indwelling Spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The outpoured Spirit of power as the wind is for work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE SPIRIT AND THE BRIDE</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Such an all-inclusive, compound, consummated, life-giving Spirit, the consummated Triune God as the Bridegroom, and God's redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified church as the bride, say, "Come!"</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Rev 22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Eventually, this all-inclusive Spirit becomes the Bridegroom to marry God's redeemed.</S>

   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They are regenerated in their spirit, transformed in their soul, and glorified in their body to match the marrying God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God and His wife are thus exactly the same in life, in nature, and in expression, just as Eve was the same as Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This all-inclusive Bridegroom will be a fulfillment of the type of Adam, marrying one who is out of Him and transformed into His image, glorified with His glory, and brought back to Him to be one couple.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the end of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Now we have seen the one Bible, the one God, the one Christ, and the one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The one Bible is a revelation of the Triune God; the Father is the source and substance, the Son is the element, and the Spirit is the essence to apply the consummated Triune God to His chosen and redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I have purposely released these ten "ones" because I do not know how long the Lord will keep me here, so I must give you a very basic and all-inclusive view of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All the co-workers and elders should know this.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>By this fellowship we can see clearly what the Lord's recovery is.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is not to recover baptism by immersion or the Lord's table with one cup and one bread.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>These are not the major items of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I feel that I have been in the Lord's hands to finish the full interpretation of the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Now I want to present these ten "ones" as the real conclusion to this interpretation.</S>
