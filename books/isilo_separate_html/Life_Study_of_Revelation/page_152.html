GOD&rsquo;S PRESERVATION OF THE WOMAN</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Giving Her the Two Wings of the Great Eagle<br /> to Fly into the Wilderness</h2><p>Verse 14 says, &ldquo;And the two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman that she might fly into the wilderness into her place.&rdquo; The &ldquo;great eagle&rdquo; signifies God, and the &ldquo;two wings&rdquo; signify His strength to rescue (Exo. 19:4; Deut. 32:11-12). As God brought the children of Israel out from Pharaoh&rsquo;s persecution, so will He bring His people away from Satan&rsquo;s persecution in the great tribulation. The mighty God will afford His people divine strength to escape Satan&rsquo;s persecution.</p><p>Some may wonder what the wilderness is. I cannot answer this question definitely, but I do have my own realization of what it might be. Although I do not wish to interpret this verse, I am willing to share with you my realization of what the wilderness is. Since its beginning, the United States has been a land to which people who desire a free conscience toward God might escape. We are all familiar with the story of the Mayflower. The pilgrims fled from persecution and escaped to this country. For more than three hundred years, America has been used by God as a refuge for His escapees. The symbol of this country is an eagle. When the persecution comes, many of God&rsquo;s people may escape to the United States by airplane. Hallelujah, there will be a wilderness on earth for God&rsquo;s escapees! Even today, the United States is still a refuge for escapees.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Swallowing the River by Opening the Earth</h2><p>We have seen that the dragon will &ldquo;cast water like a river out of his mouth after the woman.&rdquo; Verse 16 says, &ldquo;The earth helps the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth.&rdquo; At that time, just as in Numbers 16:31-33, the earth will open and swallow the armies sent by Satan. This means that during those three and a half years there will be many earthquakes. God will use these earthquakes to open the earth to swallow the armies sent by Satan. Do not be on earth at this time. Rather, we should watch this from the heavens. When God sends the earthquakes during the great tribulation, earth will no longer be a good place on which man can dwell peacefully. God will shake the earth, not only to warn the earth dwellers, but also to swallow up Satan&rsquo;s armies. Satan will send his frogs to stir up the kings of the earth to send their armies, but God will move His little finger to shake the earth that the earth might swallow up the armies. This will be God&rsquo;s way to deal with the situation.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Nourishing Her in the Wilderness<br />a Thousand Two Hundred and Sixty Days</h2><p>Verse 6 says, &ldquo;The woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, so that they might nourish her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days.&rdquo; Moreover, verse 14 says that the woman will &ldquo;fly into the wilderness into her place,&rdquo; where she will be &ldquo;nourished for a time, and times, and half a time from the face of the serpent.&rdquo; After the rapture of the man-child, the woman will be left on earth to suffer persecution (v. 13). During the time of the great tribulation, God will prepare a place to nourish her for &ldquo;a time, and times, and half a time,&rdquo; or &ldquo;a thousand two hundred and sixty days,&rdquo; the three and a half years of the great tribulation. God will nourish her before He brings His people into the millennial kingdom. This is similar to the time when Pharaoh persecuted the children of Israel and God brought His people to the wilderness, where He nourished them before bringing them into the good land. The United States is so rich in food that it can nourish nearly any number of people. No country on earth is as rich in food as the United States. Praise the Lord that there will be such a nourishing place on earth!</p><p>We have seen a general picture of the coming days. Since Genesis 3:15, both the woman and the serpent have been present, fighting against one another. Throughout the years, this fighting has increased and intensified. It will continue to do so until the time of the end when all the martyred saints will be resurrected and raptured to the heavens as the man-child. When they reach the throne, they will say, &ldquo;Satan, here we are. Now that we have come, you must go down to earth.&rdquo; Then Michael, the archangel, and his angels will war against the dragon and his angels. The dragon will be cast to the earth and the great tribulation will begin. During that time, the dragon will persecute and make war against the people of God who are still on earth. This will last three and a half years. But God will still be sovereign. On the one hand, He will swallow up Satan&rsquo;s armies by opening the earth. On the other hand, He will afford a way for His people to escape and He will nourish them in a special place. God will preserve His people. However, I do not want to enjoy that preservation. I prefer to be taken away before the great tribulation. How about you? Praise the Lord for this clear picture of the coming days.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_151.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_153.html">Next</a> </body></html>
