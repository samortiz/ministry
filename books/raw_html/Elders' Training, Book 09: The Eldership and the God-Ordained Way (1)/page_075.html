<P>If we take this new way the Lord has shown us, we will double after one year and many of the saints will have been trained, perfected, and instructed to speak with content. I believe that the Lord will recover this way to the uttermost. The result of this way is not a great congregation of people coming together as a facade to make a good show. If we are faithful to the Lord, the time will come when the Lord will gain twenty thousand out of a city of one hundred fifty thousand. On the Lord's Day, they all may be serving the Lord in different ways. Some may go out to knock on doors, some may go out to take care of home meetings, and others may be taking care of small group meetings. Then many homes throughout the city on nearly every street and lane will be worshipping the Lord, singing hymns to Him, praising Him, and speaking Him. Occasionally, maybe once a month or once every two or three months, the whole church will come together. If we do not have a big hall, we can use an auditorium or a stadium. We do not need the eldership to control things without the proper moving in the Lord's way. This is not according to the Scriptures. On the day of Pentecost, three thousand were baptized (Acts 2:41). Within a short time, "the number of the men came to about five thousand" (4:4). How could so many be under the mere control of the elders, that is, without the positive activities according to the Lord's leading? The only way that things could be under the elders' mere control is for the church to remain with a small number. Such lack of increase is a shame to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SEEING THE VISION<br>OF THE LORD'S PRESENT RECOVERY<br>AND PRACTICING IT</H2><P>The way in the past did not work. The Lord desires to discard everything of the old, traditional, and unscriptural way. He desires to do something for His recovery in a new way. We must pick up the view of the Lord's present recovery. Otherwise, we will make ourselves dropouts. We will remain contented in our oldness. Whether or not we will go on with the Lord in His present recovery is up to us. But we have to realize that when the age turns it will not wait for us. Once the age changes, we can be passed by and become dropouts as far as the Lord's move is concerned. We must see the vision of the Lord's present recovery and practice it. Week after week and month after month, we will experience and learn something. As we do this, I have the assurance that the Lord's joy will be with us. Even more, I believe this practice will bring us into His presence. I am so strong in my old age to work so much because I have the deep sensation and consciousness that I have the Lord's presence. While I am speaking, I have the assurance that I am in His presence. His presence gives me the boldness. We must realize that no one can shake the Lord's recovery because it has been built upon life and truth. Although the storms come, the foundation of the Lord's recovery can never be shaken. The Lord's recovery is something built solidly on Christ as the rock, and it is still going on.</P>
