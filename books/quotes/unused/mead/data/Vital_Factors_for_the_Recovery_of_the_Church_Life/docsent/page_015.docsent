   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE FACTOR OF THE PROPER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE Scripture Reading: Matt 16:18; Eph 1:22-23; Acts 15:41; Rom 16:4; 2 Cor 8:1; Gal 1:2; Rev 1:4; Matt 18:17; 1 Cor 12:27; Eph 2:22; Rev 1:11; Titus 1:5; Acts 14:23; Phil 1:1; Rom 16:1; Acts 2:42; 1 John 1:3; 1 Cor 10:16-17; 1 Tim 5:19-20; Matt 20:25-28; 23:8-12; 1 Pet 5:1-3; 1 Cor 1:12-13; Acts 13:1; 1 Cor 14:26, 29; Acts 14:4, 14; 21:8</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous chapters we have covered the first three factors that are vital to the recovery of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These factors are Christ, the Spirit, and the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we consider these three factors, we should become excited and stirred up in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this chapter we come to the fourth factor that is vital to the recovery of the church life: the proper practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Concerning this factor we all need to be very calm, quiet, and sober.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to consider this fourth factor with a sober mind.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this chapter I wish to present to you a very basic truth in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To learn the truths in the Bible we need to have a sober mind, a mind which is clear, transparent, and enlightened by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need such a mind to study the truth in the Bible concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to study the truth concerning the church, not in a general way, but in a very particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We especially need to learn the truth concerning the proper practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Most Christians would agree that they need the fellowship of a church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Actually, there are very few Christians who are not members of a church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Most Christians have a church, but the question is, do they have the proper church or an improper church?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today in every large city there are too many different so-called churches.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the city of Seoul, Korea, the Roman Catholic Church is very prominent.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, it is wrong to associate the word Roman with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the Bible there is no Roman Church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Colossians 3:11 tells us that in the new man there is neither Greek nor Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, there is no such thing as the Jewish Church or the Greek Church in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, there is no Anglican Church, no Chinese Church, no Korean Church, no Presbyterian Church, no Baptist Church, and no Pentecostal Church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All these churches are improper because they are not scriptural, not according to God s holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In order to know what is proper regarding the church, we need to study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have been studying the Bible concerning the matter of the church since 1925.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this chapter I wish to present to you a brief outline of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This brief, accurate, and clear outline is the cream of my nearly sixty years of study concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I am happy to present this outline to you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>My desire is to impress you with the proper practice of the church life according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is nothing wrong with the church itself, but the way Christians practice the church life might be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Out of all the different ways of practicing the church life among Christians today, it is difficult to find one that is right.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To be right in the practice of the church life is to be according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The proper practice of the church life is not according to culture, not according to society, not according to any kind of religious background, and not according to our imagination; it must be absolutely according to the holy Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>CHRIST BUILDING THE UNIVERSAL CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church Christ is building is the universal church, not the church in a nation or the church in a city.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord Jesus said to Peter, You are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this verse the Lord considered Himself as the rock cf. v. 16 . Christ Himself is the very rock upon which the church is built.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The church in Matthew 16:18 is the universal church, the one church in the entire universe.</S>
