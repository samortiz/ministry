<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SEVEN CHURCHES<br>(Revelation 2:1â€”3:22)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. SUMMARY REMARKS ON CHAPTERS TWO AND THREE</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Seven Churches</H2><P>The seven churches mentioned in these two chapters were actual churches at the time of the early apostles. Furthermore, the description of the conditions of these churches portrays their actual situations. Yet, at the same time, these seven churches represent the seven stages of the church, and their conditions also portray the general condition of the church in different stages. However, this should not be taken in an absolute way. We are merely saying that the church following the apostles' time was more like Ephesus and the church of the second stage was more like Smyrna. Nevertheless, the condition of the church following the apostles' time bears a resemblance to that of the other six churches as well.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Seven Messengers</H2><P>Every epistle is written to a messenger. We have already studied who these messengers were. I hope that the Lord will raise us up so that we may become messengers. Although every epistle is written to a messenger, it also speaks to the church. Therefore, these epistles concern every believer.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Seven Ways of Presenting Himself</H2><P>In every epistle, our Lord says something concerning Himself. Moreover, what He speaks concerning Himself corresponds to the condition of each church. For example, Ephesus is a church which has fallen from love, so the Lord manifests Himself as the One who walks in the midst of the golden lampstands. Smyrna is a suffering church, so the Lord presents Himself as the One who resurrected from the dead so that they would be willing to be martyred. Pergamos is a worldly church; thus, the Lord appears to them as the One who has the two-edged sword which is able to cut off the world. Thyatira is a corrupt and adulterous church; therefore, the Lord manifests Himself as the One with eyes like a flame of fire and feet like shining bronze, with which He is able to search and judge. Sardis is a dead church; therefore, the Lord presents Himself as the One who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars. Philadelphia is a church that faithfully holds to the truth; thus, the Lord is seen as the One who is holy and true and who opens the door wide to them for the work. Laodicea is a church filled with human opinions; thus, the Lord presents Himself as the Head over all things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Meaning of the Names<br>of the Seven Churches</H2><P>The word "Ephesus" means "loose." This was the condition of their love. The word "Smyrna" means "myrrh," or "suffering." This was the age when the Roman Empire persecuted the church. "Pergamos" means "high tower," "marriage," or "union." During this period, the Roman emperor, Constantine, joined himself to Christianity, and the church secured a position in the world. "Thyatira" means "she sacrificed tirelessly." This was the rising up of the priesthood during the age of Roman Catholicism, in which idol worship began to take place. This may be considered as the darkest and most corrupted age of the church. The meaning of the word "Sardis" is "restoration." This is the age of the Protestant church; her spiritual condition was so weak that it was as if she were dead. "Philadelphia" means "brotherly love." A hundred years ago the church was revived. A small number of Christians left the denominations, joined together in love, and wholeheartedly kept the truths in the Bible. The word "Laodicea" means "the opinions of the people." This is the condition of the opinionated church today.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Seven "I Know's"</H2><P>Every epistle has the words "I know." Both our conduct, whether good or bad, and our condition, whether sad or joyous, are known by the Lord. The Lord does His best to praise the good, but He also severely rebukes the bad. This is a preview of the Lord's righteous judgment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Seven Warnings</H2><P>Since each church is in a different situation, the Lord warns each of them accordingly. The words of warning to each church are found in chapters two and three: to Ephesus (2:4-5), to Smyrna (2:10), to Pergamos (2:14-16), to Thyatira (2:20-25), to Sardis (3:2-3), to Philadelphia (3:9-11), and to Laodicea (3:17-20).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Seven Promises</H2><P>In order to maintain His testimony, the Lord desires to raise up overcomers in each church. Therefore, He gives special promises to them. These promises are found in the following verses: Revelation 2:7, 10-11, 17, 26-28; 3:5, 12, 21.</P>
