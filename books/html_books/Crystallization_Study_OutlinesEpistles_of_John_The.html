<h1 class="title">The Fellowship of the Eternal Life&mdash;<br />
the Reality of Living in the Body of Christ</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 John 1:1&mdash;2:2</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>John&rsquo;s Epistles (especially his first Epistle) unfold the mystery of the fellowship of the eternal life&mdash;1 John 1:3-4, 6-7:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Fellowship is the flow of the eternal life within all the believers, illustrated by the flow of the water of life in the New Jerusalem; the reality of the Body of Christ, the church life in actuality, is the flow of the Lord Jesus within us, and this flowing One must have the preeminence within us&mdash;vv. 2-4; Rev. 22:1; Col. 1:18b; cf. Ezek. 47:1.</li>
	<li>Fellowship is the flowing Triune God&mdash;the Father is the fountain of life, the Son is the spring of life, and the Spirit is the river of life; this flowing issues in the totality of eternal life&mdash;the New Jerusalem&mdash;John 4:14b; Rev. 22:1-2.</li>
	<li>Fellowship is the imparting of the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;into the believers as their unique portion and blessing for them to enjoy today and for eternity&mdash;1 Cor. 1:9; 2 Cor. 13:14; Num. 6:22-27.</li>
	<li>Fellowship indicates a putting away of private interests and a joining with others for a certain common purpose; hence, to be in the divine fellowship is to put aside our private interests and join with the apostles and the Triune God for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s purpose&mdash;Acts 2:42; 1 John 1:3.</li>
	<li>Fellowship comes from teaching; if we teach wrongly and differently from the apostles&rsquo; teaching, the teaching of God&rsquo;s economy, our teaching will produce a sectarian, divisive fellowship&mdash;Acts 2:42; 1 Tim. 1:3-6; 6:3-4; 2 Cor. 3:8-9; 5:18.</li>
	<li>First John reveals the principles of the divine fellowship, 2 John reveals that we must have no fellowship with those who deny Christ (vv. 7-11), and 3 John reveals that we should stay in the one fellowship of God&rsquo;s family by sending forward those who travel for the gospel and the ministry of the word in a manner worthy of God and by not loving to be first in the church (vv. 5-10).</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The fellowship of the eternal life is the reality of living in the Body of Christ in the oneness of the Spirit&mdash;1 Cor. 10:16-18; Acts 2:42; Eph. 4:3:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We enter into the vertical aspect of the divine fellowship by the divine Spirit, the Holy Spirit; this aspect of fellowship refers to our fellowship with the Triune God in our loving Him&mdash;2 Cor. 13:14; 1 John 1:3, 6; Mark 12:30.</li>
	<li>We enter into the horizontal aspect of the divine fellowship by the human spirit; this aspect of fellowship refers to our fellowship with one another by the exercise of our spirit in our loving one another&mdash;Phil. 2:1; Rev. 1:10; 1 John 1:2-3, 7; 1 Cor. 16:18; Mark 12:31; Rom. 13:8-10; Gal. 5:13-15.</li>
	<li>The one divine fellowship is an interwoven fellowship&mdash;the horizontal fellowship is interwoven with the vertical fellowship:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The initial experience of the apostles was the vertical fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ, but when the apostles reported the eternal life to others, they experienced the horizontal aspect of the divine fellowship&mdash;1 John 1:2-3; cf. Acts 2:42.</li>
		<li>Our horizontal fellowship with the saints brings us into vertical fellowship with the Lord; then our vertical fellowship with the Lord brings us into horizontal fellowship with the saints.</li>
		<li>We must maintain both the vertical and horizontal aspects of the divine fellowship in order to be healthy spiritually&mdash;cf. 1 John 1:7, 9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The divine fellowship is everything in the Christian life:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>When fellowship disappears, God also disappears; God comes as the fellowship&mdash;2 Cor. 13:14; Rev. 22:1.</li>
		<li>In this divine fellowship God is interwoven with us; this interweaving is the mingling of God and man to bring the divine constituent into our spiritual being for our growth and transformation in life&mdash;Lev. 2:4-5.</li>
		<li>The divine fellowship blends us, tempers us, adjusts us, harmonizes us, and mingles us together into one Body&mdash;1 Cor. 10:16-18; 12:24-25.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In order to remain in the enjoyment of the divine fellowship, we need to take Christ as our sin offering for the indwelling sin in our nature and as our trespass offering for the sinful deeds in our conduct&mdash;1 John 1:8-9; 3:20-21; Lev. 4:3; 5:6; John 1:29; Rom. 8:3; 2 Cor. 5:21; 1 Pet. 2:24-25:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Sin is the evil nature of Satan, who injected himself into man through Adam&rsquo;s fall and has now become the sinful nature of lawlessness that is dwelling, acting, and working as a law in fallen man&mdash;Rom. 5:12, 19a, 21a; 6:14; 7:11, 14, 17-23; Psa. 51:5; 1 John 3:4; cf. 2 Thes. 2:3, 7-8.</li>
	<li>Taking Christ as our sin offering means that our old man is dealt with (Rom. 6:6), that sin in the nature of fallen man is condemned (8:3), that Satan as sin itself is destroyed (Heb. 2:14), that the world is judged, and that the ruler of the world is cast out (John 12:31):
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The word <em>ruler</em> in &ldquo;the ruler of this world&rdquo; implies authority or power and the struggle for power&mdash;Luke 4:5-8; cf. Matt. 20:20-21, 24; 3 John 9.</li>
		<li>The struggle for power is the result, the issue, of the flesh, sin, Satan, the world, and the ruler of the world&mdash;Gal. 5:16-17, 24-26.</li>
		<li>The law of sin in our flesh is the spontaneous power, strength, and energy to struggle with God; the law of the sin offering is the law of the life of the pneumatic Christ, whom we enjoy, to automatically and spontaneously free us from the law of sin&mdash;Rom. 7:23; 8:2; Lev. 6:24-30; cf. 7:1-10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We partake of Christ as our sin offering in the sense of enjoying Him as our life, the life that bears others&rsquo; sins, so that we may be able to bear the problems of God&rsquo;s people by ministering Christ to them as the sin-dealing life for them to be kept in the oneness of the Spirit&mdash;1 John 5:16; Lev. 10:17.</li>
	<li>Through our genuine, intimate, living, and loving fellowship with God, who is light (1 John 1:5; Col. 1:12), we will realize that we are sinful, and we will take Christ as our sin offering and trespass offering:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The more we love the Lord and enjoy Him, the more we will know how evil we are&mdash;Isa. 6:5; Luke 5:8; Rom. 7:18.</li>
		<li>Realizing that we have a sinful nature and taking Christ as our sin offering cause us to be judged and subdued, and this realization preserves us, for it causes us not to have any confidence in ourselves&mdash;Phil. 3:3; cf. Exo. 4:6.</li>
		<li>Man, created by God for the purpose of expressing and representing God, should be for nothing other than God and should be absolutely for God; thus, anything we do out of ourselves, whether good or evil, is for ourselves, and since it is for ourselves and not for God, it is sinful in the eyes of God; sin is being for the self&mdash;Gen. 1:26; Isa. 43:7; Rom. 3:23:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Serving the Lord for ourselves is sin; preaching ourselves is sin&mdash;Num. 18:1; 2 Kings 5:20-27; Matt. 7:22-23; 2 Cor. 4:5.</li>
			<li>Doing our righteous deeds, such as giving alms, praying, and fasting, for ourselves to express and display ourselves is sin&mdash;Matt. 6:1-6.</li>
			<li>Loving others for ourselves (for our name, position, benefit, and pride) is sin; raising up our children for ourselves and for our future is sin&mdash;Luke 14:12-14; cf. 1 Cor. 7:14.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The Lord uses our failures to show us how horrible, ugly, and abominable we are, causing us to forsake all that is from the self and to completely depend on God&mdash;Psa. 51; Luke 22:31-32; Rom. 8:28.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To take Christ as the reality of the trespass offering is to experience Him as the redeeming One, the shining One, and the reigning One in order to enjoy Him as the supply of life in the fellowship of life&mdash;1 John 1:1&mdash;2:2; Rev. 21:21, 23; 22:1-2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In taking Christ as our trespass offering, we need to make a thorough confession of all our sins and impurity to have a good and pure conscience&mdash;Acts 24:16; 1 Tim. 1:5, 19; 3:9; 2 Tim. 1:3; Heb. 9:14; 10:22.</li>
		<li>If we confess our sins, God is faithful in His word to forgive us our sins and righteous in His redemption to cleanse us from all unrighteousness; furthermore, Christ as our elder Brother is our Advocate with the Father to restore our interrupted fellowship with the Father that we may abide in the enjoyment of the divine fellowship&mdash;1 John 1:7, 9; 2:1-2.</li>
		<li>The cleansing of the blood of Jesus the Son of God solves the problem of separation from God, the problem of guilt in our conscience, and the problem of accusations from Satan, thus enabling us to have a daily life full of God&rsquo;s presence&mdash;Psa. 103:1-4, 12-13; 32:1-2; Rev. 12:10-11.</li>
		<li>Taking Christ as our trespass offering with the confession of our sins in the divine light is the way to drink Christ as the living water for us to become the New Jerusalem&mdash;John 4:14-18.</li>
		<li>Taking Christ as our trespass offering to receive the forgiveness of sins issues in our fearing God and loving God&mdash;Psa. 130:4; Luke 7:47-50.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>As we are enjoying Christ in the divine fellowship, we continually experience a cycle in our spiritual life of four crucial things&mdash;the eternal life, the fellowship of the eternal life, the divine light, and the blood of Jesus the Son of God; such a cycle brings us onward in the growth of the divine life until we reach the maturity of life to corporately arrive at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ&mdash;1 John 1:1-9; Heb. 6:1; Eph. 4:13.</li>

<h1 class="title">Knowing the Triune God<br />
by Experiencing and Enjoying Him</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 John 1:1-3; 2:1, 27; 3:24; 4:9-10, 13-15;<br />
2 John 8; 3 John 11</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>We come to know the Triune God by experiencing and enjoying Him&mdash;1 John 1:5; 2:27; 4:16; 5:11-12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The concern of the apostle John in writing his Epistles was the experience and enjoyment of the Triune God&mdash;2 John 8.</li>
	<li>The Triune God is not merely the object of our faith; He is dwelling in us as our life and life supply for our experience and enjoyment&mdash;1 John 4:13-15.</li>
	<li>We need to know the Triune God experientially through the inner enjoyment of the subjective God&mdash;2:27; 4:4.</li>
	<li>If we would know the Triune God, we must be in the line of life and in the process of the growth in life; the more we grow in life, the more we will be concerned with the Divine Trinity&mdash;2:13-18.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Trinity of the Godhead is revealed more fully in the Gospel of John than any other place in the Bible; concerning this, 1 John is both a continuation and a development of the Gospel of John&mdash;John 14:6-24, 26; 15:26; 16:13-15; 1 John 3:24; 4:13-14; 5:11-12.</li>
<li>The Epistles of John reveal the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;1 John 1:1-2; 2:23-24; 3:24; 4:2, 6, 13-14; 5:6, 11-12; 2 John 9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To know God as the Father is to know Him as the source, the unique Initiator, the One who plans, originates, and initiates; everything originates with Him, and everything proceeds from Him&mdash;1 John 1:2-3; 2:13, 15; 3:1; 4:14; Matt. 15:13; Rom. 11:36; 1 Cor. 8:6; Eph. 3:14-16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Father is the source of the eternal life; from Him and with Him the Son was manifested as the expression of the eternal life for the people of the Father&rsquo;s choice to partake of and enjoy&mdash;1 John 1:2-3; 5:11-12.</li>
		<li>The title <em>Father</em> refers to the impartation of life; through Christ&rsquo;s resurrection the Father imparts His life to His children&mdash;3:1; 1 Pet. 1:3.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In 1 John 1:1-2 both <em>the Word of life</em> and <em>life</em> denote the divine person of Christ the Son, who was with the Father in eternity and was manifested in time through incarnation&mdash;John 1:1, 14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ the Son is the eternal, preexisting One who is from the beginning&mdash;1 John 2:13a, 14a.</li>
		<li>The Son of God was manifested, that He might undo and destroy the works, the sinful deeds, of the devil&mdash;3:8b.</li>
		<li>God sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins&mdash;4:10:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Christ is the sacrifice for our propitiation before God&mdash;2:2.</li>
			<li>The Lord Jesus Christ offered Himself to God as a sacrifice for our sins (Heb. 9:28), not only for our redemption but also for the satisfying of God&rsquo;s demand, thus appeasing the relationship between us and God.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>God sent His only begotten Son into the world that we might have life and live through Him&mdash;1 John 4:9:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Son of God saves us not only from our sins by His blood but also from our death by His life&mdash;Eph. 1:7; 1 John 3:14-15; John 5:24.</li>
			<li>Christ is not only the Lamb of God who takes away our sin but also the Son of God who gives us eternal life&mdash;1:29; 3:36; 10:10b.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The Son of God is the means through which God gives us eternal life&mdash;1 John 5:11-12:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Because the life is in the Son and the Son is the life, the Son and the life are one, inseparable&mdash;John 11:25; 14:6; Col. 3:4.</li>
			<li>He who has the Son has the life, and he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life&mdash;1 John 5:12.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Our Advocate with the Father is Jesus Christ the Righteous; when we sin, the Lord Jesus, based on the propitiation that He accomplished, takes care of our case by interceding and pleading for us&mdash;2:1; Rom. 8:34.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Spirit of truth in 1 John 4:6 is the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of reality&mdash;John 14:17; 15:26; 16:13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Spirit is the reality; this means that the Spirit is the reality of all that Christ as the Son of God is&mdash;1 John 5:6.</li>
		<li>By the Spirit whom God gave to us, we know that the Triune God abides in us&mdash;3:24.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>First John 4:13-14 reveals that we are abiding in God the Father and He in us, that God the Father has given to us of His Spirit, and that the Father has sent the Son as the Savior of the world:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li><em>Out of His Spirit</em> (lit.) in verse 13 implies that the Spirit of God, whom God has given to us, is bountiful and without measure; by such a bountiful, immeasurable Spirit we know with full assurance that we and God are one and that we abide in each other&mdash;Phil. 1:19; John 3:34.</li>
		<li>Our God, the Father, has given us the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit, who is the bountiful supply of Jesus Christ, the Son&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The experience and enjoyment of the Triune God has a focal point: God becoming man, the God-man, and this God-man accomplishing redemption and in resurrection becoming the life-giving Spirit&mdash;1 John 4:9-10, 13-14; 1 Cor. 15:45b.</li>
<li>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one yet are distinct in the Godhead but without separation, for the Father, the Son, and the Spirit coexist in the way of coinherence&mdash;John 10:38; 14:10-11, 20; 17:21.</li>
<li>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all in us, but from experience we know that we have only One in us; this One who dwells in us is the Triune God&mdash;Eph. 4:6; Col. 1:27; John 14:17; 1 John 4:13, 15.</li>
<li>The anointing is the moving of the Triune God experienced and enjoyed by us; the teaching of the anointing is actually the Triune God teaching us concerning Himself&mdash;2:20, 27.</li>
<li>Eternal life is the Triune God whom we experience in the fellowship of the divine life, according to the divine anointing, and by the virtues of the divine birth with the divine seed&mdash;1:3, 7; 2:20, 27, 29; 3:9; 4:16.</li>
<li>To see God means to enjoy God and experience Him&mdash;3 John 11:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We cannot see God without enjoying Him, and we cannot know God without experiencing Him&mdash;Job 42:5, footnote 1.</li>
	<li>Knowing God and seeing God are a matter of experiencing and enjoying Him; our experience of God is our knowing of Him, and our enjoyment of God is our seeing of Him.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>When the Triune God becomes our experience and enjoyment, He is not only the One on the throne who is universally vast, but He is also the One in our heart&mdash;Rev. 4:2-3; 5:6; 1 John 3:19-21:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We know the Triune God not in the vastness of the universe but in the personal realm of our heart&mdash;Heb. 8:10-11.</li>
	<li>The concern of the New Testament is that we know the Triune God who has come to dwell in our being&mdash;the One who dwells in our spirit and desires to spread into all the inward parts of our heart&mdash;Eph. 3:14-17a; 1 John 3:19-21.</li>
	<li>The New Testament way for us to know the Triune God is personal, detailed, and experiential&mdash;2:20, 27; Heb. 10:16.</li>
	<li>How precious is this experiential way of knowing the Triune God!</li>

<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery today is in the time of the mending ministry of John, mending the rents in the church by the ministry of life for God&rsquo;s building in life; the focus of John&rsquo;s writings is the mysteries of the divine life&mdash;Matt. 4:21; John 1:4; 10:10b; 14:6a; 1 John 1:1-3; 2:25; 3:15; 5:11-13, 20:

<li>When we are in the fellowship, the enjoyment, of God as the eternal life, we partake of God in His divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4) as Spirit, love, and light; Spirit is the nature of God&rsquo;s person (John 4:24), love is the nature of God&rsquo;s essence (1 John 4:8, 16), and light is the nature of God&rsquo;s expression (1:5):
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>If we spend an adequate amount of personal time with the Lord and remain in the fellowship with Him daily and hourly, we will enjoy the Lord as the Spirit, and we will become persons who are full of the divine love (the inner substance of God) and the divine light (the expressed element of God)&mdash;v. 3; 2 Cor. 13:14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The divine love is God Himself poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit to be the source for our enjoyment of the dispensing of the Triune God and the motivating power within us, that we may more than conquer over all our circumstantial situations&mdash;Rom. 5:5; 8:37, 39.</li>
		<li>The divine light is the divine life in the Son operating in us; this light shines in the darkness within us, and the darkness cannot overcome it&mdash;John 1:4-5; 1 John 1:5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>When we enjoy God by touching God and being infused with God in the divine fellowship, we walk, live, move, and have our being in His Spirit as our person, in His love as our essence, and in His light as our expression for us to be His corporate testimony&mdash;Rom. 8:4; Eph. 5:2, 8; Matt. 5:14-16.</li>

	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The divine birth is the basis of our Christian life&mdash;John 3:3, 5; 1 Pet. 1:3, 23.</li>
	<li>The divine birth, which brings in the divine life, is the basic factor of all the mysteries of the divine life&mdash;1 John 1:1-2.</li>
	<li>The Father is the source of the divine life, the One of whom we have been born with this life&mdash;3:1.</li>
	<li>The divine birth&mdash;regeneration&mdash;enlivens us with God&rsquo;s life and brings us into a relationship of life, an organic union, with God&mdash;Rom. 8:16; 1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
	<li>To be regenerated simply means to receive the divine life in addition to our human life; through the divine birth eternal life has come into us&mdash;John 3:15-16; 1 John 2:25; 5:11-13.</li>
	<li>Regeneration causes us to become a new creation, something which has the element of God within it&mdash;Gal. 6:15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Through the divine birth we have the divine life and the divine element, thereby becoming a new creation&mdash;2 Cor. 5:17.</li>
		<li>When we were born again, God&rsquo;s life in Christ entered into us; this life, with the divine element, has been mingled with our spirit to become the new man within us&mdash;Eph. 4:24; Col. 3:10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To be regenerated is to receive the tree of life&mdash;Gen. 2:9; Rev. 22:2, 14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>When we received the Lord Jesus, we received the life of the tree of life&mdash;John 11:25; 15:1.</li>
		<li>We have passed out of the death of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil into the life of the tree of life&mdash;5:24; 1 John 3:14.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To be regenerated is to be born of the Spirit in our spirit&mdash;John 3:6, 8:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Regeneration takes place in the realm of the human spirit by the Spirit of God with the divine life&mdash;vv. 6, 15-16:

			<li>The divine Spirit regenerates the human spirit with the divine life&mdash;Rom. 8:2, 10, 16.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>That which is born of the Spirit of God is our regenerated spirit&mdash;John 3:6.</li>
		<li>In 1 John 5:4 <em>everything</em> refers to every person who has been begotten of God; such an expression should refer especially to the part that has been regenerated with the divine life&mdash;the spirit of the regenerated believer.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In Christ&rsquo;s resurrection He imparted the divine life into us and made us the same as He is in life and nature; this is the basic factor of our regeneration&mdash;1 Pet. 1:3; John 3:15-16.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>By the mysterious divine birth with the divine life, we have become children of God&mdash;1:12-13; 1 John 3:1:

	<li>It is the greatest wonder in the universe that human beings could be begotten of God and sinners could be made children of God&mdash;2:29&mdash;3:1; 4:7; 5:1, 4, 18.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s purpose in creating man was not simply to have a sinless man but to have a God-man, one who has the life and nature of God for the corporate expression of God&mdash;Gen. 2:9; John 10:10b; 2 Pet. 1:4.</li>
	<li>The expression <em>children of God</em> in 1 John 3:1 is very rich in its implications; it implies that God has been born into us and that we possess His life and nature:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To be a child of God means that God has been conceived within us.</li>
		<li>When we were born of God in our spirit, we were mingled with Him&mdash;1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>By being regenerated, we have become children of God&mdash;John 1:12-13; 3:3, 5-6; 1 John 2:29&mdash;3:1:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We have been begotten of the Father to be children of God&mdash;v. 1.</li>
		<li>For human beings to become children of God is for them to be born of God to have the divine life and nature&mdash;John 1:12-13; 3:15-16; 2 Pet. 1:4.</li>
		<li>Since to be regenerated is to be born of God and to obtain God&rsquo;s life, regeneration automatically causes us to become children of God&mdash;John 3:6; Rom. 8:16.</li>
		<li>The life we receive through regeneration enables us to be and is our authority to be God&rsquo;s children&mdash;John 1:12-13.</li>
		<li>As the children of God with the life and nature of God, we can live God and be the same as God in life, nature, and expression, thus fulfilling the purpose of God&rsquo;s creation of man&mdash;Gen. 1:26.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The children of God have been regenerated of God the Spirit to be God-men, belonging to the species of God to see and enter into the kingdom of God&mdash;John 3:3, 5-6:

		<li>God has a good pleasure to make us, His children, the same as He is in life and nature but not in the Godhead&mdash;Eph. 1:5, 9; 5:1.</li>
		<li>Because we have been born of God, we are the same as God in life and nature but not in the Godhead&mdash;Rom. 8:2, 10, 16; 2 Pet. 1:4.</li>
		<li>All the children of God are in the divine realm of the divine species.</li>
		<li>We should never forget that, as children of God, we are God-men, born of God and belonging to the species of God&mdash;John 1:12-13; 3:3, 5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The children of God have a great future with a splendid blessing&mdash;1 John 3:2:

		<li>By seeing Him, we will reflect His likeness; this will cause us to be as He is&mdash;1 John 3:2.</li>

Mark 4:26; 1 Pet. 1:23; Col. 2:19; 1 Cor. 3:9</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The intrinsic element of the entire teaching of God&rsquo;s eternal economy is that the Triune God in humanity, the wonderful Christ as the Spirit of the glorified Jesus, is sown into God&rsquo;s chosen people as the seed of life, the seed of God, so that He might grow in them, live in them, develop in them, and be expressed from within them as the farm of God for the building up of the church as the house of God and the kingdom of God&mdash;Mark 4:11-20, 26-29; Matt. 16:18; 1 Cor. 3:9; 1 Pet. 1:23; cf. Deut. 22:9.</li>
<li>Regeneration means that the seed of the divine, uncreated, eternal, and unlimited life with the divine nature has been sown into our spirit; through regeneration our spirit has been born of God, and the seed of God abides in it&mdash;Mark 4:26; 1 Pet. 1:23; 1 John 3:9; 5:11-12; 2 Pet. 1:4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit&rdquo;&mdash;John 3:6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>&ldquo;Flesh&rdquo; is our natural man, our old man, our outer man, born of our parents who are flesh; but &ldquo;spirit,&rdquo; our regenerated spirit, is our spiritual man, our new man, our inner man, born of God who is the Spirit&mdash;2 Cor. 4:16; Eph. 3:16.</li>
		<li>The divine Spirit regenerates our human spirit with God&rsquo;s divine life, thus making our spirit life&mdash;Rom. 8:10.</li>
		<li>Regeneration brings forth in us a newborn spirit, a new spirit (Ezek. 36:26), indwelt by and mingled with God&rsquo;s divine Spirit to be one spirit (Rom. 8:16; 1 Cor. 6:17).</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;Everything that has been begotten of God overcomes the world&rdquo;&mdash;1 John 5:4a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The word <em>everything</em> refers especially to our regenerated spirit, our spirit of faith; our regenerated spirit overcomes the world, and our regenerated spirit with the seed of God in it does not practice sin&mdash;2 Cor. 4:13; 1 John 3:9.</li>
		<li>Our regenerated spirit keeps us from living in sin, and when we are in our regenerated spirit, the evil one does not touch us&mdash;5:18; cf. Psa. 91:1-2.</li>
		<li>When we are in our spirit where the pneumatic Christ dwells, we are in Christ, the One in whom Satan, the ruler of the world, has nothing (no ground, no chance, no hope, and no possibility in anything)&mdash;2 Tim. 4:22; John 14:30b; cf. Phil. 4:13.</li>
		<li>The whole world lies in the evil one; the only exception to this is our regenerated spirit&mdash;1 John 5:19.</li>
		<li>Only one thing in the whole universe does not have Satan&rsquo;s footprints on it&mdash;our regenerated spirit; as long as we remain in our regenerated spirit, we will be kept absolutely in the dispensing Triune God, and Satan will have no way in us&mdash;cf. John 17:11, 15; Num. 6:24.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>There is only one true God, and this true God is in our spirit; whatever is not in the spirit or of the spirit is an idol, something that is against Christ or that replaces Christ&mdash;1 John 5:19-21:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Anything we do that is not in the regenerated spirit and that does not live out the Lord Spirit is an idol; an idol is anything within us that we love more than the Lord and that replaces the Lord in our life&mdash;cf. Ezek. 14:3.</li>
		<li>We need to flee into the presence of God in our spirit in order to be kept from the evil one and to guard ourselves from idols; we must flee into our spirit to directly touch God and be face to face with God for the growth of His seed in us&mdash;Heb. 6:18-20; Exo. 33:11a, 14; 2 Cor. 2:10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The seed of the divine life, the seed of God, that has been sown into us needs to grow in us so that we may grow with the growth of God, with the increase of God as life, and be transformed in life to become precious materials for God&rsquo;s building in life&mdash;Col. 2:19; 1 Cor. 3:6, 9, 12a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>According to the Bible, growth equals building; this takes place by the growth of Christ as the divine seed of life within us; the way to grow is composed of four main items&mdash;Eph. 4:15-16:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We must love the Lord; in order to grow, we must go to the Lord to pray definitely and purposely that He will grant us a love for Him&mdash;1 John 4:19; 2 Cor. 5:14; Matt. 22:37; John 14:23; 1 Cor. 2:9.</li>
		<li>We must deal with the Lord thoroughly by confessing all our failures, shortcomings, weaknesses, filthiness, and trespasses in the light of His presence so that we may have a good and pure conscience&mdash;1 John 1:7, 9; 1 Tim. 1:5; 2 Tim. 1:3; Acts 24:16.</li>
		<li>We must learn how to discern our spirit and exercise our spirit&mdash;Heb. 4:12; Eph. 3:16; 2 Tim. 1:6-7; Rom. 8:6.</li>
		<li>We must always stay in contact with the Lord, remaining in touch with Him&mdash;1 John 1:3.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>After being sown into our spirit, the divine seed needs to grow in the soil of our heart, and this growth needs our cooperation&mdash;Matt. 13:3-9, 19-23:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>For the growth of Christ as the life seed in us, we must deal with the Lord daily to be poor in spirit, to be emptied in our spirit, acknowledging that we have nothing, know nothing, can do nothing, and are nothing apart from Christ as the Spirit, the new, present, and &ldquo;now&rdquo; Christ&mdash;5:3.</li>
		<li>For the growth of Christ as the life seed in us, we must deal with the Lord daily to be pure in heart, keeping our heart with all vigilance; God wants our heart to be soft, pure, loving, and at peace so that He can have a free way to grow in us&mdash;v. 8; Prov. 4:23; Matt. 13:19-23.</li>
		<li>For the growth of Christ as the life seed in us, we must drink the guileless milk and eat the solid food of the word of God&mdash;1 Pet. 2:2; Heb. 5:12-14.</li>
		<li>For the growth of Christ as the life seed in us, we must enjoy the watering of the Spirit by the gifted members of the Body&mdash;1 Cor. 3:6, 9.</li>
		<li>When Christ as the seed of life grows in us and fully makes His home in our hearts, we will be filled unto all the fullness of God&mdash;the Body of Christ as the corporate expression of the Triune God&mdash;Eph. 3:17, 19b.</li>

		<li>If we are under God&rsquo;s dispensing, we participate in God&rsquo;s nature as light and are constituted with this element of His nature&mdash;1:5; 2 Cor. 4:6.</li>

		<li>Because light is the source of truth, and truth is the issue of light, when we walk in the light, we practice the truth&mdash;1 John 1:6-7.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The divine light, which shines in the divine life and issues in the divine truth, is embodied in the Lord Jesus, God incarnate&mdash;John 1:1, 4, 14; 8:12; 9:5; 14:6.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The truth concerning the person of Christ is the basic and central element of John&rsquo;s mending ministry&mdash;1 John 4:2-3, 15; 2 John 7-9.</li>
<li>In John&rsquo;s writings the Greek word for <em>truth</em> (<em>aletheia</em>) denotes all the realities of the divine economy as the content of the divine revelation, conveyed and disclosed by the holy Word&mdash;John 17:17; 18:37:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Truth is God, who is light and love, incarnated to be the reality of the divine things for our possession&mdash;1:1, 4, 14-17.</li>
	<li>Truth is Christ, who is God incarnated and in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily, as the reality of God and man, of all the types, figures, and shadows of the Old Testament, and of all the divine and spiritual things&mdash;Col. 2:9, 16-17; John 4:23-24.</li>
	<li>Truth is the Spirit, who is Christ transfigured, as the reality of Christ and of the divine revelation&mdash;14:16-17; 15:26; 16:13-15.</li>
	<li>Truth is the Word of God as the divine revelation, which reveals and conveys the reality of God and Christ and of all the divine and spiritual things&mdash;17:17.</li>
	<li>Truth is the contents of the faith (belief), which are the substantial elements of what we believe, as the reality of the full gospel&mdash;Eph. 1:13; Col. 1:5.</li>
	<li>Truth is the reality concerning God, the universe, man, man&rsquo;s relationship with God and with his fellow man, and man&rsquo;s obligation to God, as revealed through creation and the Scriptures&mdash;Rom. 1:18-20; 2:2, 8, 20.</li>
	<li>Truth is the genuineness, truthfulness, sincerity, honesty, trustworthiness, and faithfulness of God as a divine virtue and of man as a human virtue, and as an issue of the divine reality&mdash;3:7; 15:8; 2 Cor. 11:10; 1 John 3:18.</li>
	<li>Truth denotes things that are true or real, the true or real state of affairs (facts), reality, veracity, as the opposite of falsehood, deception, dissimulation, hypocrisy, and error&mdash;Mark 12:32; John 16:7; Acts 26:25; Rom. 1:25.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li><em>Your truth</em> (3 John 3, lit.) is the truth concerning Christ, especially His deity, by the revelation of which the recipient&rsquo;s way of life is determined and to which the recipient holds as his fundamental belief:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The objective truth becomes ours; thus, the truth becomes subjective to us in our daily walk&mdash;2 John 2.</li>
	<li>Our life is determined, shaped, and molded by the revelation of this truth; this means that we live, walk, and behave in the divine reality, the Triune God, who is our enjoyment&mdash;v. 4.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>To walk in the truth is to live in the truth; the truth concerning the person of Christ should be not only our belief but also our living, a living that testifies to our belief&mdash;2 John 4; 3 John 3-4.</li>
<li>To be fellow workers in the truth is to join ourselves to those who, as faithful workers of the truth, work for God in the divine truth, and it is to do whatever we can to support these traveling brothers and promote this work&mdash;vv. 5-8.</li>
<li>It is crucial that we see the picture of the divine reality presented by John in his Epistles&mdash;1 John 5:6; 3 John 12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The central factor in 1 John is the divine reality&mdash;the Triune God dispensed into us for our experience and enjoyment&mdash;4:13-14; 5:6.</li>

	<li>The divine reality is the Father in the Son and the Son as the Spirit dispensed into God&rsquo;s chosen, redeemed, and regenerated people so that they may enjoy Him as life, the life supply, and everything&mdash;14:6, 12-13, 16-20.</li>

	<li>He is within our spirit to anoint us, to &ldquo;paint&rdquo; us, with the elements of the Triune God; the more this anointing, this &ldquo;painting,&rdquo; goes on, the more the Triune God with His person and processes is transfused into our being.</li>
	<li>We need to be &ldquo;painted&rdquo; persons, those who are saturated with the anointing; we should be those on whom the paint is &ldquo;wet,&rdquo; always having a fresh application of the all-inclusive Spirit as the divine paint so that we may paint others with the all-inclusive Spirit&mdash;Psa. 92:10; Zech. 4:14; 2 Cor. 3:6, 8.</li>
	<li>By the anointing of the all-inclusive, compound Spirit, who is the composition of the Divine Trinity, we know and enjoy the Father, the Son, and the Spirit as our life and life supply&mdash;1 John 2:20, 27.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We need to see and experience the compounded ingredients of our abundantly rich processed and consummated Triune God, who is the anointing Spirit, typified by the holy anointing oil&mdash;Exo. 30:22-33:

	<li>Olive oil signifies the Spirit of God with divinity; the olive oil as the base of the compound ointment, the holy anointing oil, is produced by the pressing of olives, signifying the Spirit of God flowing out through the pressure of Christ&rsquo;s death&mdash;Isa. 61:1-2; Heb. 1:9; Matt. 26:36.</li>
	<li>Flowing myrrh signifies the precious death of Christ:

	<li>Sweet calamus signifies the precious resurrection of Christ:

		<li>Calamus is a reed standing up (shooting into the air) and growing in a marsh or muddy place&mdash;cf. 1 Pet. 3:18.</li>
		<li>We need to experience the Spirit as the reality of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection&mdash;John 11:25; 20:22; Lam. 3:55-57.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Cassia signifies the repelling power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection:

		<li>We need to know the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection in the life-giving Spirit as the all-sufficient grace of the processed and consummated Triune God&mdash;Phil. 3:10; 2 Cor. 12:9-10; 1 Cor. 15:10, 45b, 58; Phil. 4:23.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We need to see and experience the reality of the numbers used in the type of the holy anointing oil:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The only God is signified by the one hin of olive oil&mdash;Exo. 30:24; 1 Tim. 1:17.</li>
	<li>The Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;is signified by the three units of the measure of the four spices&mdash;Exo. 30:23-24.</li>
	<li>Man, the creature of God, is signified by the four spices of the plant life&mdash;vv. 23-24; John 19:5; 1 Tim. 2:5.</li>
	<li>The mingling of divinity with humanity is typified by the blending of the olive oil with the four spices&mdash;Rom. 8:16; 1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
	<li>The power for responsibility is signified by the number five&mdash;Matt. 25:2, 4, 8.</li>
	<li>The building element is signified by the numbers three and five&mdash;Gen. 6:15-16; Exo. 26:3; 27:13-15.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We need to see and be warned by the intrinsic significance of the prohibitions concerning the use of the holy anointing oil; this is to keep us from having a living that is in the principle of antichrist, the principle of being against Christ and replacing Christ, the principle of being &ldquo;anti-anointing,&rdquo; which is to be &ldquo;anti&rdquo; the moving, working, and saturating of the Triune God within us&mdash;1 John 2:20-27; cf. Lev. 14:14-17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The compound ointment was not to be poured upon the flesh of man&mdash;signifying that whenever we live and walk according to the flesh, we are through with the compound Spirit&mdash;Exo. 30:32; cf. Rom. 8:4; Gal. 5:16.</li>
	<li>The compound ointment was not to be put upon a stranger&mdash;signifying that when we act and behave according to our flesh, we are in the old creation and are regarded as strangers in the sight of God&mdash;Exo. 30:33; Gal. 5:24-25.</li>
	<li>The children of Israel were not to make anything like it, according to its composition&mdash;signifying that we should not imitate anything of the compound Spirit, any spiritual virtue, by the effort of our natural life&mdash;Exo. 30:32; cf. Matt. 15:7-8; Gal. 5:22-23.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The holy anointing oil is solely for the purpose of anointing God&rsquo;s dwelling place and the priesthood; hence, only those who are for God&rsquo;s dwelling place and for the priesthood can have the enjoyment of the compound, all-inclusive Spirit as the anointing&mdash;Exo. 30:26-31; Phil. 1:19.</li>
<li>The anointing of the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit is the element of our oneness for the building up of the Body of Christ in the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity; the ground of oneness is simply the processed Triune God applied to our being&mdash;Psa. 133; Eph. 4:3-6.</li>

	<ol class="upper-alpha">

	<li>We need to dwell in God, living in Him every minute, for outside of Him there are sins and afflictions&mdash;vv. 3-11; John 16:33.</li>
	<li>To take God as our habitation, our eternal dwelling place, is the highest and fullest experience of God&mdash;Psa. 91.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>To abide in Christ, taking Him as our dwelling place, and to allow Him to abide in us, taking us as His dwelling place, is to live in the reality of the universal incorporation of the processed and consummated Triune God with the redeemed and regenerated believers&mdash;John 14:2, 10-11, 17, 20, 23:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The New Jerusalem is the ultimate incorporation of the processed and consummated Triune God with the regenerated, sanctified, renewed, transformed, conformed, and glorified tripartite church&mdash;Rev. 21:3, 22.</li>
	<li>The New Jerusalem is the tabernacle of God, and the center of the tabernacle is Christ as the hidden manna; the way to be incorporated into this universal, divine-human incorporation, the mutual abode of God and man, is to eat Christ as the hidden manna&mdash;v. 3; Exo. 16:32-34; Heb. 9:4; Rev. 2:17.</li>

	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When we love the Lord Jesus, He manifests Himself to us, and the Father comes with Him to make an abode with us for our enjoyment; this abode is a mutual abode, in which the Triune God abides in us and we abide in Him&mdash;v. 23.</li>
	<li>The more we love the Lord, the more we shall have His presence, and the more we are in His presence, the more we shall enjoy all that He is to us; the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is a recovery of loving the Lord Jesus&mdash;1 Cor. 2:9-10; Eph. 6:24.</li>

	<li>Christ as the Head is the anointed One and the anointing One, and we are His members enjoying Him as the inner anointing for the fulfillment of His purpose&mdash;Heb. 1:9; 3:14; 2 Cor. 1:21-22.</li>
	<li>The anointing, as the moving and working of the compound Spirit within us, anoints God into us so that we may be saturated with God, possess God, and understand the mind of God; the anointing communicates the mind of Christ as the Head of the Body to His members by the inner sense, the inner consciousness, of life&mdash;Psa. 133; 1 Cor. 2:16; Rom. 8:6, 27.</li>
	<li>When the Head wants a member of the Body to move, He intimates it through the inner anointing, and as we yield to the anointing, life flows freely from the Head to us; if we resist the anointing, our relationship with the Head is interfered with, and the flow of life within us is stopped&mdash;Col. 2:19.</li>

	<li>The way to abide in Christ as the empowering One so that He may be activated within us as the inner operating God, the law of the Spirit of life, is by rejoicing always, praying unceasingly, and giving thanks in everything&mdash;Phil. 4:13; 2:13; 1 Thes. 5:16-18; Col. 3:17.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We abide in Christ so that He may abide in us by dealing with the constant word in the Scriptures, which is outside of us, and the present word as the Spirit, which is within us&mdash;John 5:39-40; 6:63; 2 Cor. 3:6; Rev. 2:7:

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:28&mdash;3:10a</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The fellowship of the divine life and the teaching of the divine anointing should have an issue&mdash;the expression of the righteous God&mdash;1 John 2:29; 3:7.</li>
<li>The word <em>righteous</em> in 2:29 refers to the righteous God in 1:9 and to Jesus Christ the Righteous in 2:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The righteousness of God is what God is in His actions with respect to justice and righteousness&mdash;Rom. 1:17; 3:21-22; 10:3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Righteousness is related to God&rsquo;s actions and activities&mdash;Rev. 16:7; 19:2.</li>
		<li>God is righteous in His ways&mdash;His governing principles by which He does things; righteousness is the nature of God&rsquo;s acts&mdash;15:3; Psa. 103:7.</li>
		<li>God is righteous in the blood of Jesus His Son, which has fulfilled God&rsquo;s righteous requirements so that He may forgive us our sins&mdash;1 John 1:9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In ascension Jesus Christ is the Righteous&mdash;2:1:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As the ascended One in the heavens, Christ is working and ministering righteously.</li>
		<li>As our Representative, or Attorney, in the heavenly court, Christ is the righteous One&mdash;v. 1.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>There are two aspects of Christ being righteousness from God to the believers&mdash;1 Cor. 1:30; Matt. 5:20:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The first aspect is that Christ is the believers&rsquo; righteousness for them to be justified before God objectively at the time of their repenting unto God and believing into Christ&mdash;Rom. 3:24-26; Acts 13:39; Gal. 3:24b, 27.</li>
	<li>The second aspect is that Christ is the believers&rsquo; righteousness lived out of them as the manifestation of God, who is the righteousness in Christ given to the believers for them to be justified by God subjectively&mdash;Rom. 4:25; 1 Pet. 2:24a; James 2:24; Matt. 5:20; Rev. 19:8.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>To practice the divine righteousness is to do righteousness habitually, continually, and unintentionally as a way of life in our daily living&mdash;1 John 2:29; 3:7:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>With the divine birth as the basis and the divine life as the means, we can live a life that practices the divine righteousness&mdash;2:25, 29; 3:9.</li>
	<li>The practice of the divine righteousness is a spontaneous living that issues from the divine life within us, with which we have been begotten of the righteous God&mdash;1:1-2; 2:29; 5:1.</li>
	<li>The practice of the divine righteousness is a living expression of God, who is righteous in all His deeds and acts&mdash;Rev. 15:3.</li>
	<li>The practice of the divine righteousness is not merely outward behavior but the manifestation of the inward life; it is not merely an act of purpose but the flow of life from within the divine nature, of which we partake&mdash;2 Pet. 1:4; Rev. 22:1-2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We have a righteous nature within us, a nature that is of our new man&mdash;Eph. 4:24; Col. 3:10.</li>
		<li>As we obey the inner anointing, the moving of the Triune God within us, we will live habitually according to this righteous nature&mdash;1 John 2:27.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As the result of being saturated with the Triune God, we become His expression; in particular, because God is righteous, when we express Him, we express His righteousness&mdash;3:7.</li>
	<li>Because we abide in the righteous God and He is saturating us with what He is, we express His righteousness by living a righteous life habitually and unintentionally&mdash;2:29.</li>
	<li>To practice the divine righteousness&mdash;to live a righteous life that is the expression of the righteous God&mdash;is to purify ourselves&mdash;3:3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li><em>Righteous</em> in verse 7 equals <em>pure</em> in verse 3.</li>
		<li>To be righteous is to be pure, without any stain of sin, lawlessness, and unrighteousness, even as Christ is.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To practice sin (lawlessness) is to live a life which is not under the ruling principle of God over man; to practice righteousness is to live rightly under the principle of God&rsquo;s ruling&mdash;vv. 4, 7.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>To practice the divine righteousness is to live out and express the righteousness of God in a full and complete way&mdash;Matt. 5:20; Rom. 8:4; 2 Cor. 3:9; 5:21; Phil. 3:9; Psa. 89:14; Rev. 19:7-8; 2 Pet. 3:13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To practice the divine righteousness is to live a life that is right with God, persons, things, and matters before God according to His righteous and strict requirements&mdash;Matt. 5:20.</li>
	<li>To practice the divine righteousness is to live out the subjective righteousness of God, which is actually God Himself in Christ lived out through us to become a daily living that is right with God and man&mdash;Phil. 3:9.</li>
	<li>To practice the divine righteousness is to live Christ; if we live Christ, we will be the most righteous persons, for the Christ who lives within us will make us right in everything and with everyone&mdash;1:20-21a.</li>
	<li>To practice the divine righteousness is to have the righteousness that is the outward expression of the Christ who lives within us as the life-giving Spirit; as Christ lives in us as the life-giving Spirit and we live Him out, our living will express the divine righteousness&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; 6:17; 2 Cor. 3:6, 9, 17-18.</li>
	<li>To practice the divine righteousness is to express the image of God; the Spirit is the essence of God living, moving, and acting within us, and righteousness is the essence of God manifested outwardly as God&rsquo;s image&mdash;Eph. 4:24; Col. 3:10.</li>
	<li>To practice the divine righteousness is to be right with God in our being; this is to have an inner being that is transparent and crystal clear, that is in the mind and will of God, and that is the righteousness of God&mdash;2 Cor. 5:21.</li>
	<li>To practice the divine righteousness is to live in the reality of the kingdom of God and under the throne of God, which is established with righteousness as the foundation&mdash;Rom. 14:17; Psa. 89:14.</li>
	<li>To practice the divine righteousness is to be clothed with righteousnesses to be the bride of Christ adorned with bright, shining righteousness&mdash;Rev. 19:7-8.</li>

<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The love of God is God Himself; love is the inward essence of God and the heart of God&mdash;1 John 4:8, 16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s predestination of us unto the divine sonship was motivated by the divine love&mdash;Eph. 1:4-5.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s giving of His only begotten Son to us so that we may be saved from perdition judicially through His death and have the eternal life organically in His resurrection was motivated by the divine love&mdash;John 3:16; 1 John 4:9-10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the love of God, the Son of God saves us not only from our sins by His blood but also from our death by His life&mdash;Eph. 1:7; Rev. 1:5; Rom. 5:10.</li>
		<li>God loved us and sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins in His judicial redemption with the intention that we might have life and live through Him in His organic salvation&mdash;1 John 2:1-2; 4:9-10; John 6:57; 14:19; Gal. 2:20.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s excelling love is seen in His becoming a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins and the propitiation place for us to meet and be infused with God; God as love meets with us and speaks to us in the propitiating, redeeming, and shining Christ so that we can be infused with Him as love, mercy, and grace for His effulgent and radiant glory&mdash;Rom. 3:24-25; Heb. 4:16; Exo. 25:17, 22.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;I drew them with cords of a man, / With bands of love&rdquo;&mdash;Hosea 11:4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The phrase <em>with cords of a man, with bands of love</em> indicates that God loves us with His divine love not on the level of divinity but on the level of humanity; God&rsquo;s love is divine, but it reaches us in the cords of a man, that is, through Christ&rsquo;s humanity.</li>
		<li>The cords through which God draws us include Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension; it is by all these steps of Christ in His humanity that God&rsquo;s love in His salvation reaches us&mdash;Rom. 5:8.</li>
		<li>Apart from Christ, God&rsquo;s everlasting love, His unchanging, subduing love, could not be prevailing in relation to us; God&rsquo;s unchanging love is prevailing because it is a love in Christ, with Christ, by Christ, and for Christ&mdash;vv. 5, 8; 8:35-39.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The practice of the divine love is the outcome of our enjoyment of the Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit, the One who is moving and working within us as the anointing in the fellowship of the divine life to saturate us with all that the Triune God is, with all that He has done, and with all that He has obtained and attained&mdash;1 John 1:3; 2:3-11, 27:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>If we would experience and enjoy the divine love and have it become the love by which we love others, we need to know God experientially by continuously living in the divine life&mdash;vv. 3-6; Phil. 3:10a.</li>
	<li>God first loved us in that He infused us with His love and generated within us the love with which we love Him and the brothers&mdash;1 John 4:19-21.</li>
	<li>The life which we have received from God is a life of love; Christ lived in this world a life of God as love, and He is now our life so that we may live the same life of love in this world and be the same as He is&mdash;3:14; 5:1; 2:6; 4:17.</li>
	<li>Our natural love must be put on the cross; one difference between God&rsquo;s love and our natural love is that it is very easy for our natural love to be offended.</li>
	<li>We must be persons who are flooded with and carried away by the love of Christ; the divine love should be like the rushing tide of great waters toward us, impelling us to live to Him beyond our own control&mdash;2 Cor. 5:14.</li>
	<li>The commandment regarding brotherly love is both old and new; old, because the believers have had it from the beginning of their Christian life; new, because in their Christian walk it dawns with new light and shines with new enlightenment and fresh power again and again&mdash;1 John 2:7-8; 3:11, 23; cf. John 13:34:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The commandments of the Lord are not merely injunctions; they are His words, which are spirit and life as a supply to us&mdash;6:63.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s love is His inward essence, and the Lord&rsquo;s words supply us with His divine essence, with which we love Him and love the brothers.</li>
		<li>We should love God and His children with the divine love that is conveyed to us through the words of the Lord to become our experience and enjoyment.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Our living in which we love one another in the love of God is the perfection and completion of this love in its manifestation in us&mdash;1 John 4:11-12; 2:5.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The church life is a life of brotherly love&mdash;4:7-8; 2 John 5-6; John 15:12, 17; Rev. 3:7; Eph. 5:2; cf. Jude 12a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Body builds itself up in love&mdash;Eph. 4:16.</li>
	<li>Our God-given, regenerated spirit is a spirit of love; we need a burning spirit of love to conquer the degradation of today&rsquo;s church&mdash;2 Tim. 1:7.</li>
	<li>The one who loves God and the brothers is enjoying the divine life; the one who does not love is abiding in the satanic death&mdash;1 John 3:14; cf. 2 Cor. 11:2-3.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up&rdquo;&mdash;1 Cor. 8:1b; cf. 2 Cor. 3:6.</li>
	<li>Loving one another is a sign that we belong to Christ&mdash;John 13:34-35.</li>
	<li>Loving to be first in the church is versus loving all the brothers&mdash;3 John 9.</li>
	<li>Just as the Lord Jesus laid down His soul-life so that we might have the divine life, we need to lose our soul-life and deny the self to love the brothers and minister life to them in the practice of the Body life&mdash;1 John 3:16; John 10:11, 17-18; 15:13; Eph. 4:29&mdash;5:2; 2 Cor. 12:15; Rom. 12:9-13.</li>
	<li>We need to lose our soul-life by not loving the world with its pleasure; instead, taking in God and expressing God as love in the church life of brotherly love should be our joy, amusement, entertainment, and happiness&mdash;1 John 2:15-17; Matt. 16:25-26; Psa. 36:8-9; cf. 2 Tim. 3:4.</li>
	<li>Brotherly love in the church life is expressed practically in our caring for the necessities of the needy saints without any self-serving purpose or outward self-display; in the sharing of material things with the needy saints, the grace of the Lord&rsquo;s life with His love flows among the members of the Body of Christ and is infused into them&mdash;1 John 3:17-18; Matt. 6:1-4; Rom. 12:13; 2 Cor. 8:1-7.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>First John 4 tells the secret of how to stand boldly before the judgment seat of Christ&mdash;abide in love&mdash;vv. 16-18; 2 Cor. 5:10, 14:

	<li>To abide in love is to live a life in which we love others habitually with the love that is God Himself so that He may be expressed in us&mdash;1 John 4:16.</li>
	<li>Perfect love is the love that has been perfected in us by our loving others with the love of God; such love casts out fear and has no fear of being punished by the Lord at His coming back&mdash;vv. 17-18; cf. Luke 12:46-47.</li>
	<li>Love is the most excellent way for us to be anything or do anything for the building up of the church as the organic Body of Christ&mdash;1 Cor. 12:31b&mdash;13:8a.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Testimony of God and the Ministering of Life</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 John 5:6-17</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The testimony of God is the testimony by the water, the blood, and the Spirit that Jesus is the Son of God&mdash;1 John 5:6-10:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In order to know the significance of the mystery of the water, the blood, and the Spirit, we need to understand the central thought of 1 John:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>First John&rsquo;s central thought is that God in His Son as the Spirit has come into us as our life; this life brings us into a corporate fellowship with the Triune God and the believers, and this fellowship is the church life&mdash;1:1-7.</li>
		<li>This central thought is focused on the Son of God&mdash;3:8; 4:9, 15; 5:5:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The title <em>the Son of God</em> involves the imparting of the divine life&mdash;vv. 11-12.</li>
			<li>The Son of God was manifested for the purpose of imparting the divine life&mdash;4:9.</li>
			<li>By the water, the blood, and the Spirit testimony was given as to His true identity&mdash;that He is the Son of God&mdash;5:5-9.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Jesus, the man of Nazareth, was attested to be the Son of God by the water He went through in His baptism (Matt. 3:16-17; John 1:31), by the blood He shed on the cross (19:31-35; Matt. 27:50-54), and also by the Spirit He gave not by measure (John 1:32-34; 3:34); by these three God has testified that Jesus is His Son given to us (1 John 5:7-10), that in Him we may receive His eternal life by believing into His name (vv. 11-13; John 3:16, 36; 20:31):
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The water refers to the baptism of the Lord Jesus&mdash;1 John 5:6, 8; Matt. 3:16-17:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The first manifestation of Jesus as the Son of God was His baptism by John&mdash;John 1:31-34.</li>
			<li>After He was baptized and came up from the death waters, the Spirit of God descended upon Him as a dove, and John testified that He was the Son of God&mdash;vv. 32, 34.</li>
			<li>A voice out of the heavens bore witness that this One was the beloved Son&mdash;Matt. 3:17.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The blood refers to the blood the Lord Jesus shed on the cross for our redemption&mdash;1 John 5:6, 8:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Some very special features were present at the crucifixion of Christ&mdash;Matt. 27:51-53.</li>
			<li>The centurion and those with him guarding Jesus were frightened and said, &ldquo;Truly this was the Son of God&rdquo;&mdash;v. 54.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The Spirit, who is the truth, the reality, testifies that Jesus is the Son of God, in whom is the eternal life; by thus testifying, He imparts the Son of God into us to be our life&mdash;1 John 5:6, 8; John 14:16-17; 15:26; Col. 3:4.</li>
		<li>Jesus was manifested as the Son of God in an open way by the water of baptism, by the blood He shed on the cross, and by the Spirit; by these three means God introduced His Son to mankind so that they might believe and have eternal life&mdash;John 3:15-16; 20:31; 1 John 5:9-13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The water is for termination, the blood is for redemption, and the Spirit is for germination; we, the believers, have been terminated, redeemed, and germinated, and we are now in the proper church life, which is a life of termination, redemption, and germination&mdash;Acts 2:38, 42; 1 Cor. 2:2; 10:16-17.</li>
	<li>The testimony of God is not only that Jesus is the Son of God but also that He gives to us eternal life, which is in His Son&mdash;1 John 5:10-13:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Because eternal life is in the Son, if we have the Son, we have eternal life&mdash;vv. 11-12.</li>
		<li>God testified concerning His Son so that we might believe into His Son and have His divine life; if we believe into His Son, we receive and have His testimony in ourselves&mdash;v. 10.</li>
		<li>The written words of the Scriptures are the assurance to the believers, who believe into the name of the Son of God, that they have eternal life&mdash;v. 13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In 1 John 5:14-17 there is the indication not only that we have eternal life and enjoy it but also that we can minister this life to other members of the Body:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Verses 14 through 17 show us that the eternal life within us can overcome death both in ourselves and in other members of the church.</li>
	<li>Verse 16 is the only reference in the Bible to ministering life:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To minister life is to impart life.</li>
		<li>When we have a surplus of life, we can minister from this supply to others&mdash;v. 16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Verse 14 speaks of prayer in the fellowship of eternal life:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We should ask according to God&rsquo;s will, not according to our way, desire, or preference.</li>
		<li>The prayer that is according to God&rsquo;s will indicates that the praying one is abiding in the fellowship of the divine life and is also abiding in the Lord Himself, and thus he is truly one with the Lord&mdash;John 15:4-5.</li>
		<li>The knowing in 1 John 5:15 is based on the fact that after receiving the divine life we abide in the Lord and are one with Him in our praying to God in His name&mdash;John 15:7, 16; 16:23-24.</li>
		<li>In 1 John 5:16 <em>he shall ask</em> and <em>he will give life</em> refer to the same person, that is, to the one who sees his brother sinning and asks concerning him:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Such an asker, who is abiding in the Lord and who is one with the Lord (1 Cor. 6:17), becomes the means, the channel, by which God&rsquo;s life-giving Spirit can give life to the one for whom he is asking.</li>
			<li>This is a matter of the ministering of life in the fellowship of the divine life.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The vital point is that if we would pray for a brother according to what is described in 1 John 5:16, we need to be one with the Lord&mdash;John 15:7.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To be one who can give, impart, life to others, we must abide in the divine life and live, walk, and have our being in the divine life&mdash;1 John 1:1-7.</li>
	<li>What is described in 5:14-17 can be experienced only by those who are deep in the Lord:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We need to experience and enjoy the eternal life within us, and we need to minister this life by being a channel through which eternal life can flow to other members of the Body.</li>
		<li>If we would be a channel for eternal life to flow out to others, we must be deep in the Lord, and we must know the Lord&rsquo;s heart by being in His heart&mdash;Psa. 25:14; Gen. 18:17, 22-33; Amos 3:7.</li>

<h1 class="title">The True God as the Eternal Life<br />
and the Seven Issues of the Seven Mysteries<br />
in the First Epistle of John</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:12-14; 4:4; 5:4-5, 18, 20-21;<br />
2 John 7, 9-11; 3 John 9-10</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The Son of God has come and has given us an understanding so that we might know the true One, the genuine and real God&mdash;1 John 5:20:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>This understanding is the faculty of our mind enlightened and empowered by the Spirit of reality to apprehend the divine reality in our regenerated spirit&mdash;Eph. 4:23; John 16:12-15.</li>
	<li><em>Know</em> in 1 John 5:20 is the ability of the divine life to know the true God in our regenerated spirit through our renewed mind, enlightened by the Spirit of reality&mdash;John 17:3; Eph. 1:17.</li>
	<li>In 1 John 5:20 <em>Him who is true</em>&mdash;or <em>the true One</em>&mdash;refers to God becoming subjective to us, to the God who is objective becoming the true One in our life and experience:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The true One is the divine reality; to know the true One means to know the divine reality by experiencing, enjoying, and possessing this reality.</li>
		<li>This indicates that the divine reality&mdash;God Himself, who was once objective to us&mdash;has become our subjective reality in our experience&mdash;v. 6.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To be in the true One is to be in His Son Jesus Christ&mdash;v. 20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This indicates that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is the true God.</li>
		<li>This also indicates that the true One and Jesus Christ are one in the way of coinherence; thus, to be in the Son is to be in the true One.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The word <em>this</em> in verse 20 refers to the God who has come through incarnation and has given us the ability to know Him as the genuine God and to be one with Him organically in His Son Jesus Christ:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This genuine and real God is eternal life to us so that we may partake of Him as everything for our regenerated being.</li>
		<li><em>This</em> refers to the true God and Jesus Christ in whom we are; it includes the fact that we are in this One, the true One, and implies that, in a practical sense, eternal life is the God in whom we are experientially.</li>
		<li>Therefore, the true God and eternal life include our being in the true One and in His Son Jesus Christ; now in our experience the true One becomes the true God, and Jesus Christ becomes eternal life.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Epistles of John reveal the seven issues of the seven mysteries in 1 John: life (1:1-7), fellowship (vv. 3, 5-10), abiding (2:5-6, 24, 27-28; 3:24), the anointing (2:20, 27), the divine birth (v. 29; 3:9; 4:7; 5:1), the divine seed (3:9), and the water, the blood, and the Spirit (5:6-9):
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>There will be distinctions in the level of life in the church life&mdash;2:12-14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>There will be the growth in life that brings in the distinctions in life between the young children, the young men, and the fathers.</li>
		<li>If there is no growth in life, the believers will all be on the same level as far as life is concerned.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>There will be a strong testimony of victory&mdash;the testimony that the One who is in us is greater than the one who is in the world&mdash;4:4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The One who is in the believers is the Triune God, who dwells in them as the all-inclusive, life-giving, anointing Spirit and who strengthens them from within with all the rich elements of the Triune God&mdash;Eph. 3:16-19.</li>
		<li><em>He who is in the world</em> is Satan, the evil spirit; such a one is lesser and weaker than the Triune God.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We will overcome the world&mdash;1 John 5:4-5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The regenerated believers have the capability of the divine life to overcome the world, the powerful satanic world system&mdash;v. 5; 2:15.</li>
		<li>The regenerated spirit of the regenerated believer overcomes the world; the believer&rsquo;s divine birth with the divine life is the basic factor for such victorious living&mdash;5:4.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We will not be touched by the evil one&mdash;v. 18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li><em>The evil one</em> refers to one who is pernicious, harmfully evil, one who affects others, influencing them to be evil and vicious; such an evil one is Satan, the devil, in whom the whole world lies&mdash;v. 19.</li>
		<li>A regenerated believer (especially his regenerated spirit, which is born of the Spirit of God&mdash;John 3:6) keeps himself from living in sin, and the evil one does not touch him (especially his regenerated spirit):
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Whether or not we are under Satan&rsquo;s authority is not determined by what we do; it is determined by whether we are in the Spirit or in the flesh&mdash;Gal. 5:16-17.</li>
			<li>As long as we remain in the mingled spirit&mdash;the regenerated human spirit mingled with the divine Spirit as one spirit&mdash;we will be kept, and Satan will have no way with us&mdash;1 Cor. 6:17; 1 John 5:18.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We will not have idols&mdash;v. 21:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li><em>Idols</em> refer to the heretical substitutes for the true God and to anything that replaces the true God, the subjective God, the God whom we have experienced and are still experiencing&mdash;4:13-15.</li>
		<li>An idol is anything that replaces the true God, the Triune God experienced by us as our life in a practical way&mdash;5:20.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We will reject the antichrists&mdash;2 John 7, 9-11; 1 John 2:18, 22:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>An antichrist is one who denies Christ&rsquo;s deity, denying that Jesus is the Christ, that is, denying the Father and the Son by denying that Jesus is the Son of God, not confessing that He has come in the flesh through the divine conception of the Holy Spirit&mdash;v. 23; 4:2-3.</li>
		<li>The principle of antichrist is to deny some aspect of Christ&rsquo;s person and to replace it with something other than Christ&mdash;2:18.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We will not follow the divisive ones&mdash;3 John 9-10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Diotrephes loved to be first; this is self-exaltation in one&rsquo;s actions&mdash;v. 9.</li>
		<li>Diotrephes dominated the church in which he was, rejecting the apostles and some good saints and even casting out of the church those who received these saints&mdash;v. 10.</li>
		<li>The cause of division is mainly rivalry for leadership; if we refuse to follow self-appointed leaders, there will not be any division&mdash;Luke 22:24-27.</li>
