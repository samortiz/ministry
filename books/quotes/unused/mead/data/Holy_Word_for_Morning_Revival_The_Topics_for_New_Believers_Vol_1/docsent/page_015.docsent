   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Two Ways to Touch the Bible</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There are two ways to touch the Bible: the outward way and the inward way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The outward way to touch the Bible is by exercising our mind merely to understand it, while the inward way is by using our spirit not mainly to understand it but to touch the spirit and get the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>John 1:1 is a wonderful verse.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Suppose two brothers come together to read this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After reading it, one brother may ask, "What does in the beginning mean?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The other brother may say, "God is the beginning."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The first brother may respond, "I don't think so.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How can you say that God is the beginning?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I don't understand what you are talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>And what is the Word?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This verse says that the Word was with God and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>" This is an illustration of touching the Bible in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Touching the Bible even for only a few minutes in this way is deadening.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is another way to touch the Bible, the inward way, the way of exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Suppose these same two brothers come to the Word in the following way, saying, "O Lord, in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the beginning was the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hallelujah for the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>O Lord, the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hallelujah, for the Word!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>And the Word was with God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>O God!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>And the Word was God!"</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When we exercise our spirit to touch the Word in such a living way, we may not understand much, but we are filled with the Spirit, and we get the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is true of any verse or chapter, from the first verse of Genesis to the last verse of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Sometimes we may not understand what we read, and sometimes we may understand but not be able to utter what we see.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We may even say, "Praise the Lord, I received something this morning, but I do not have the words to speak it!"</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The right way to touch the Bible is to touch the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must never separate the Bible from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Whenever we open the Bible, we have to open our mouth and open our spirit to utter something to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We can say, "O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>O Lord Jesus!"</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>67</S>
