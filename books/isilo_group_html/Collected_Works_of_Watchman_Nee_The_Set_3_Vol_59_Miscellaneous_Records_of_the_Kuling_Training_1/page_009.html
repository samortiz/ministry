We do not work by dispensing doctrines and theology to others, but by touching others with spirit. Our work is not based on our knowledge, theology, doctrine, or reason but our spirit. Once our outer man is broken, it is easy for our spirit to be released. The release of our spirit is the release of our power. Once our spirit reaches out and touches others' spirits, there is ministration and edification. If a man releases his spirit, yet his spirit does not touch others' spirits, it will return like the dove that was sent out from Noah's ark. The dove did not find a place to rest, and it was forced to return to the ark. The release of the spirit also brings in the inward operation of the Holy Spirit within us for others. The gift of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost was brought in through the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. It was based on Christ's work on the cross. But the power of the Holy Spirit is not manifested only in His outpouring. Another aspect of the power of the Holy Spirit is manifested from within man and is expressed in service. Actually, this is the proper source of power. The goal of our work is to release our spirit within us. When our spirit is released, the Holy Spirit within us is released as well.</p><p>In the New Testament the Holy Spirit abides in man. Man's spirit is the habitation of the Holy Spirit. Bible translators have conflicting opinions on how to translate the many occurrences of the word spirit. They cannot agree on whether the word should be upper case (for the Holy Spirit) or lower case (for the human spirit). In many instances the word can refer either to the Holy Spirit or the human spirit. It is hard to say what the various instances of the word spirit in Romans 8 refer to, whether they refer to the human spirit or the divine Spirit. Even Paul did not bother to make the distinction when he wrote his letter. In a regenerated person it is hard to separate the human spirit from the divine Spirit. It is useless to try to separate them artificially. God is pleased to mingle His Spirit with our spirit. There is no difference between our spirit and the Holy Spirit. When the Holy Spirit works, the human spirit works. The power of the Holy Spirit is the power of the human spirit.</p><h2 class="head3">Supplying Others</h2><p>Our spirit is our inner man, and our inner man is often surrounded, boxed in, and encircled by the outer man. As a result, the power of the Holy Spirit cannot be released. Our own emotions, feelings, peculiarities, ideas, and wisdom are obstacles; they prevent the inner man from being released. Unless our outer man is broken, our inner man will not be released. Speaking for God involves the release of the inner man. The ministry of the word is the release of the spirit within and an outflow of life to others. A servant of God faces a basic frustration when his inner man cannot break through his outer man. Our outer man must be broken before the inner man can pass through. Once a man opens his mouth, we can tell whether or not he is broken. It is a joy to see men who have been fully tried by God. Those who have passed through God's dealings and have been tried in many ways will surely have wounds and scars; there will be a trail of blood following them. The Holy Spirit will have a free way through them, and it will be easy for them to release their spirit. Some people, however, only give others an impression of their mind, emotion, eloquence, and wisdom when they open their mouth. When they speak, one only hears words. Their words are like a gust of wind which sweeps across one's face, leaving nothing behind. A man who has been broken by God, however, can release his spirit easily. Those who listen to him receive spiritual supply from him. Some people go around in circles in their conversation; their words revolve around their mind, and their spirit is never released. These ones can only boast of their great mind; their spirit is never released, and they cannot render any help to others.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 59: Miscellaneous Records of the Kuling Training (1) &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
