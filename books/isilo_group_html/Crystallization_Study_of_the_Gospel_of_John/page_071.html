God Entering into the Human Species<br>and Man Entering into the Divine Species</H2><P>God became flesh to enter into the human species, and man becomes God in His life and nature, but not in His divine Godhead, to enter into His divine species. In John 3 the kingdom of God refers more to the species of God than to the reign of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Entering into the Divine Realm<br>by Being Born of God</H2><P>For something to be in the animal species, it must be born of an animal. Also, to enter into the divine realm, the realm of the divine species, we need to be born of God to have the divine nature and life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Man Being Created in God's Kind</H2><P>That man was created in the image of God and after His likeness indicates that man was created in God's kind, in God's species. Genesis 1 says that each of the living things was created after its kind. But God created man, not after man's kind, but in God's image and after God's likeness to be God's kind.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Believers Born of God<br>Being More in God's Kind Than Adam Was</H2><P>The believers, who are born of God by regeneration to be His children in His life and nature but not in His Godhead (John 1:12-13), are more in God's kind than Adam was. Adam had only the outward appearance of God without the inward reality, the divine life. We have the reality of the divine life within us and we are being transformed and conformed to the Lord's image in our entire being. It is logical to say that all the children of God are in the divine realm of the divine species.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. God-men in the Divine Species</H2><P>Thus, in regeneration God begets gods. Man begets man. Goats beget goats. If goats do not beget goats, what do they beget? If God does not beget gods, what does He beget? If the children of God are not in God's kind, in God's species, in what kind are they? If they are not gods, what are they? We all who are born of God are gods. But for utterance, due to the theological misunderstanding, it is better to say that we are God-men in the divine species, that is, in the kingdom of God.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_070.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_072.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crystallization-Study of the Gospel of John &nbsp; pg 71</div><br></body></html>
