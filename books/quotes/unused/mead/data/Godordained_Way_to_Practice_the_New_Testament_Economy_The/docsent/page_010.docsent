   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From incarnation to ascension was a process through which the Son of God, God s anointed One, was completed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Through this process He was fully equipped, fully qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now He is in the heavens with all His qualifications to be God s Christ, God s anointed One, to carry out God s eternal commission.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE PNEUMATIC CHRIST IN ACTS</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After the Gospels, this completed Christ was preached as the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The gospel is not only a gospel of redemption, of forgiveness of sins, of life, or of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The gospel itself is this completed Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This multiplication becomes the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The term the church in Acts is not mentioned as a doctrine, a teaching, or even as a revelation, but as a practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The church in Jerusalem 8:1 , the church in Antioch 13:1 , and the churches in Syria and Cilicia 15:41 are a reality in practice.</S>
