<P>Among all the things we believe in, one chief item is the matter of being "in Christ." According to the New Testament teaching, God has saved us and put us in Christ. There is no position higher than this. The forgiveness of sins is in Christ. Justification is in Christ. Sanctification is in Christ. Every spiritual blessing is in Christ. No matter what things there are, they are all in Christ. Being in Christ is higher than any kind of grace. All that God has given to us is in Christ. The big question is how can we be in Christ. Mr. Hudson Taylor yearned for a victorious living. Although he knew that everything is in Christ, he struggled fruitlessly to abide in Christ. It seemed like he was always falling away from Christ. One day God gave him a revelation and showed him that he was in Christ. He did not need to ask how he could be in Christ. He was regenerated; therefore, he was in Christ. What he needed to do was rest on the fact. This is the meaning of abiding in Christ. He was in Christ. He could not be more "in Christ." This was how he gained the victory. This was for him the gate of faith, and he entered this gate. Only after entering the gate this way could he grasp the fact of his being in Christ day by day, and only then could he continuously trust in God in an attitude of faith. Otherwise, even though he believed, his trusting would not be effective.</P><P>Although the words in Christ are short, the truth behind them is quite profound. In fact, it is so profound that it is unfathomable and unsurpassed by anything else. Ephesians 1:3 says that God "blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ." All the blessings are in Christ. Since there are so many blessings in Christ, why do so many people not receive them, even though they seem to have believed? The reason is that they do not realize the two sides of faith. There is the need for the act of faith, and there is the need for the attitude of faith. Many people have believed, but what they have is just the attitude of faith; they do not have the act of faith. In other words, they have never specifically, desperately, and as a one-time act, believed in God's fact. They are misled to think that an attitude of faith is faith. If they would first pass through the barrier of faith and then maintain an attitude of faith, they would experience many blessings in Christ. We have said that the day we pass through the barrier is the day we received everything. We have received everything, but it is another matter whether or not we have experienced everything. When we come into a garden, we can see everything in it. But this does not necessarily mean that we have walked through all the paths of the garden. After we have entered, we still have to claim everything that is ours before we can gain all that is ours. First we enter the gate; then we walk in the way.</P><P>When God ordered the Israelites to pass over the river Jordan, He first said to Joshua, "Now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel. Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses" (Josh. 1:2-3). Before they passed over Jordan, God promised them the land of Canaan. He only required them to pass over. Did the Israelites have the faith? They did. Those who did not have the faith died in the wilderness. Those who entered into Canaan had the faith. They laid hold of God's word and crossed the river Jordan, saying, "From now on, the land of Canaan is ours. We only need to cross the river to get the land."</P><P>After they passed over the river Jordan, did they gain all the land immediately? Satan was not willing to concede so easily. The wall of Jericho was very high, and the gate to the city was shut tight. If we were there, we would probably go back to God and say, "You said the land of Canaan has been given to us, and we have also crossed the river. But the wall of Jericho is so high, and the gate of the city is shut tight. Could it be that Your words have failed?" But the Israelites were not like this. They went by God's word and laid hold of God's promise. They circled the city once on the first day and did the same thing the next day. This went on for six days. On the seventh day, they circled the city seven times. Then they shouted, believing that the Lord had given them the city, and the walls of Jericho crumbled. After that they gained every city that they passed through. Although they experienced failures and did not chase out the seven tribes of Canaan, they managed to possess most of the cities.</P><P>We ought to lay hold of all the spiritual blessings in Christ by faith in the same way that the Israelites crossed the river and gained the land by laying hold of God's word. This is like a father passing on a title deed to his son before he dies. The son has to locate the land and manage the property according to what is written in the title deed. The property is his, but he has not yet seen it or managed it. He has to examine and manage it according to the words of the deed. Accepting the title deed is an act of faith; it is the gate. Enjoying the content of the title deed is an attitude of faith; it is the progression.</P><P>God says, "Go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people." This is a gate of faith. After passing through the gate, they destroyed city after city; this is to walk on the way. The way of faith is to claim the cities one by one according to His word. If you read the New Testament, you will see that everything in Christ is yours. If you still do not think you have anything, you have not yet passed through the gate of faith. If you have not passed through the gate of faith, you can never walk the path of faith, and your spiritual condition will not advance. It is of no use to merely hear many doctrines on faith. You must pass through a gate, saying, "O God, I thank You! You have given me the land of Canaan; this land is mine." You must lay hold of the title deed to possess the land. Do not simply ask if the land is yours. Claim it because it is yours.</P><P>The first thing to do is to pass through the gate. Take your "title deed" and accept from God the blessings in Christ; this is the gate of faith. You may feel that you have jealousy, pride, and passion and that you lack kindness, humility, and meekness. You may ask the Lord once, twice, even dozens of times to deliver you. However, when the Lord reveals the riches in Christ, you will see how foolish it was to ask for deliverance this way. If God has shown you His Word which says, "My grace is sufficient for you," why do you have to pray anymore? The Lord says, "I am holiness; I am meekness; I am full of all kinds of grace." Everything is in Christ. God has to show you the riches in Christ before you can pass through the gate. After this, you will increasingly experience the grace that is in Christ.</P>
