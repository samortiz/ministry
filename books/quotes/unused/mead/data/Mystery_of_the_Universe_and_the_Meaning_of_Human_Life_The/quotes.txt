[1]  The Mystery of the Universe and the Meaning of Human Life CONTENTS
[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE MYSTERY OF THE UNIVERSE Scripture Reading: Rom 1:19-20; Psa 19:1; Acts 14:15-17; 17:24-28a; Job 26:7; Isa 40:22; Gen 1:27; 2:7a; Rom 9:21-24a; Zech 12:1 The mystery of the universe is God: Because that which is known of God is manifest within them, for God manifested it to them.
[3]  For the invisible things of Him, both His eternal power and divine characteristics, have been clearly seen since the creation of the world, being perceived by the things made, so that they would be without excuse Rom 1:19-20.
[4]  The living God, who made heaven and earth and the sea and all things in them; who in the generations gone by allowed all the nations to go their ways.
[5]  And He made from one every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, determining beforehand their appointed seasons and the boundaries of their dwelling, that they might seek God, if perhaps they might grope for Him and find Him, even though He is not far from each one of us; for in Him we live and move and are 17:24-28a.
[6]  Man s spirit is as important as the heavens and the earth; the heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man is for God; God is Spirit, so God created man especially with a spirit as the organ to receive God.
[7]  Here the human spirit is greatly emphasized, for the verse says that at the same time that God created the heavens and the earth, He also created a spirit for man within.
[8]  This means that the heavens are for the earth to grow all things, the earth is for man s existence, and man s existence is for him to be God s vessel to express God.
[9]  God loves us and has created a stomach for us in our body that we may take in food.
[10]  Rather, we tell people that the universe is a sphere created by God for Himself, that in it He could create man as a vessel in which He can put Himself.
[11]  CHAPTER TWO THE MEANING OF HUMAN LIFE Scripture Reading: Eph 2:12; John 7:37-38; 6:35; 14:6; 10:10; 1 John 5:12a; Col 3:4; Gal 2:20a; Phil 1:20b-21a The meaning of human life is Christ: Apart from Christ,...having no hope and without God in the world Eph 2:12.
[12]  Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.
[13]  This tells us that as those who live in the world, there is no hope if we are apart from Christ, because we do not have God.
[14]  Once when the Lord Jesus was on the earth, on the last day of a feast, He stood up among a crowd and cried out, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink John 7:37 .
[15]  At that juncture, Jesus stood up and cried, He who believes into Me...out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water v. 38 . The living water and the innermost being mentioned here are both figures of speech, pointing to the fact that this Savior as the Spirit of life wants to enter into us as living water to quench the thirst of us who thirst.
[16]  CHAPTER THREE CHRIST LIVES IN ME Scripture Reading: Col 2:2; 1:27; 1 Tim 3:16; Gal 2:20 RECEIVING THE BURDEN
[17]  From August and September of 1986, when we started the Full-time Training in Taipei, the total number of people who have been led to the Lord and baptized through door-knocking has reached more than 17,500.
[18]  Therefore, we beseech the brothers and sisters to receive a burden from the Lord to take care of these new ones and to pray much for this matter.
[19]  The Bible does not merely teach us to know God and to worship God, nor does it teach us merely how to live and walk in an excelling way.
[20]  These mysteries include the mystery of God, the mystery of the universe, the mystery of human life, the mystery of the kingdom of the heavens, the mystery of Christ, the mystery of the church, the mystery of life, the mystery of resurrection, the transformation and rapture of the believers, the consummation of the age, the millennial kingdom, and eternity.
[21]  For example, He said that He is the life and the bread of life as well, and that he who comes to Him shall by no means hunger John 6:35 ; that He has the water of life, and he who draws near to Him shall by no means thirst forever 4:14 ; that He is the resurrection 11:25 ; and that He is God Himself 1:1, 14 .
[22]  This Christ who is transcendent and trustworthy now lives in us to be our subjective experience.
[23]  Therefore, we have to realize that even though the Bible teaches us how to conduct ourselves as human beings, this is not the center of the Bible.
[24]  He created the universe Gen 1:1 , became flesh John 1:14 , went to the cross to bear the sins of and die for the whole human race 1 Pet 2:24 , and in His resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b to enter into us to be our life John 20:22; Col 3:4 .
[25]  He came into man as life, not by the touching of the human hand, nor by the seeing of the human eye, nor by the hearing of the human ear, but by the spirit in the depths of man echoing to God as the Spirit.
[26]  After we receive the Lord Jesus and are saved, if there is anything that contradicts love, light, holiness, and righteousness in the way we conduct ourselves and in our daily life, He will give us a feeling within, causing us to have no peace.
[27]  Paul said in chapter one that Christ would be magnified as always in his body, whether through life or through death v. 20 , and he went on to say that for him to live was Christ v. 21 . Christ was his inward life and also his outward expression.
[28]  In chapter three he explained how he himself regarded Christ as the One of supreme preciousness and how he even suffered the loss of all things and counted them as refuse that he might gain, enjoy, and experience Christ v. 8 . At the end, in the last chapter, he charged and exhorted us with six virtues 4:8 . Now we want to see in a practical way the six items in which we experience Christ as our virtues.
[29]  God created us in His image of love, light, holiness, and righteousness.
[30]  After the fall He also ordained that the Lord Jesus would become a man and pass through death and resurrection to become the Spirit to enter into us who believe in Him to be our life and content.
[31]  Today the Lord Jesus, who became flesh, died, and resurrected, is the living Spirit, and as such, He enters into all those who believe into Him, just like air entering into us.
[32]  In the Bible God uses air to illustrate that the Lord is the breath of life to us John 20:22 .
[33]  Just as our physical life needs air, the life in our spirit, which is higher than our physical life, is a matter of Jesus as the breath of life, the Spirit of life, coming into us to be our life.
[34]  God s salvation is that Christ enters into us to be our life that we may have Him as life and live by Him.
[35]  I have seen some young people who in their age of metamorphosis were haughty and arrogant, but by unceasingly calling O Lord Jesus day after day, they have become dignified and mature.
[36]  Previously, they always liked to put up their fists, but now there is Someone in them the Lord Jesus who draws their fists back.
[37]  Sometimes we are about to lose our temper, and sometimes our temper has even reached the tip of our tongue, but the Lord Jesus gives us a pull, and we turn and go into our room to call, O Lord Jesus!
[38]  Once the Lord Jesus enters into man, He makes the God-created man full of the inward reality that he may express the God who is love, light, holiness, and righteousness and become true, dignified, righteous, pure, lovely, and well spoken of.
[39]  MESSAGE FIVE THE GOSPEL WE ANNOUNCE Scripture Reading: Gal 2:20
[40]  It is a very joyful thing that there are so many newly saved brothers and sisters who came from various villages and towns to break bread with us.
[41]  Though we cannot shake hands and greet each one of you, we believe we do love one another in the one Lord.
[42]  He is our Lord, and He is also the Lord of the brothers and sisters from these villages and towns.
[43]  We all have one Lord and one life, we enjoy one salvation, and we are in one Body.
[44]  The Lord Jesus not only died for our sins, but even more He died for us 2 Cor 5:14-15 .
[45]  In His dying for us the Lord Jesus bore not only our sins but also our whole being.
[46]  After we are saved, because He is living in us, we have Him as our Lord, and we are blessed because we are under His preserving and cherishing.
[47]  Taiwan is truly a good location that is most suitable for us to start practicing the new way, because the life here is stable and secure, education is at a high level and available to all, the economic condition and public security are extremely good, and transportation is especially convenient.
[48]  This reminds us of the parable the Lord Jesus spoke to us in Matthew 13, about a woman taking leaven and hiding it in the meal v. 33 . We know that the meal is Christ Himself, but today s Christianity takes leaven and mixes it with teachings concerning Christ, thus confusing the pure truth of Christ.
[49]  We need to be persons who contain God, who are filled with God, and who take God as life, that we may become God s expression and God s declaration.
[50]  In Matthew 28, when the Lord Jesus had passed through death and resurrection, He came back in resurrection into the midst of the disciples and said to them, All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth v. 18 . In heaven or on earth, all authority has been given to Him; He is the Lord of heaven and earth.
[51]  CHAPTER SEVEN OUR CHURCH LIFE 2 Scripture Reading: Luke 10:1-6, 16; Matt 28:19; John 15:4-5, 16
[52]  Today we have been called out of Christianity by the Lord to bear a testimony that is according to the Bible.
[53]  The Bible shows us that the church on the earth is one universally, and it is absolutely in oneness.
[54]  In the New Testament age the Lord Jesus came.
[55]  He was the Jehovah God who sought for Adam in the garden of Eden; He was the One who visited Abraham beside the oaks of Mamre in Genesis 18; He was also the One who came upon and visited the prophets throughout the generations.
[56]  Now He was not visiting man merely in His divinity or in His Godhead, but He Himself put on a body of flesh and blood, putting on our humanity and becoming even as we are, to visit man who was on the earth.
[57]  We need to be alert, because not all the people we visit are wolves; there are sons of peace among the wolves v. 6 . Today there are millions and millions of sons of Adam on this earth, but among them some are the sons of peace, who were born in the world yet chosen and predestinated by God before the foundation of the earth.
[58]  The Lord sent seventy people two by two to go out and visit people v. 1 and to stay in people s houses v. 7 . Upon entering a house, they would not speak of the weather or of the world situation, but into whatever house you enter, first say, Peace to this house v. 5 . They are the sons of peace, and the Lord is the Lord of peace.
[59]  When the Lord Jesus was born, the angels praised God, saying, Glory in the highest places to God, and on earth peace among men of His good pleasure 2:14 .
[60]  Furthermore, the Lord told the disciples in chapter ten verse 16, He who hears you hears Me, and he who rejects you rejects Me, and he who rejects Me rejects Him who sent Me. This means that the Lord comes with the Father; the Lord and the Father are one, so the Lord s going is the Father s going.
[61]  In the past when we read John 15, we greatly emphasized that if we abide in the Lord, the Lord will abide in us v. 4 . But we have overlooked the purpose of the abiding.
[62]  This word shows that we are the branches of the Lord Jesus, yet if we do not bear fruit, we will be cut off from Him.
[63]  In Acts 12 we see that Peter was persecuted and put into prison by Herod, and then prayer was being made fervently by the church to God concerning him v. 5b . After Peter was released from the prison by the angel, he went to the house of a sister, where there was a considerable number assembled together to pray v. 12 . Putting these two verses together, we see that the fervent prayer of the church was made not in a meeting in the meeting hall but in the home of a saint, and the home was the home of a sister.
[64]  Finally, we need to see that the more we practice this, the more we love the Lord, and the more we love the Lord, the more we pursue Him.
[65]  Some overseas saints testified that previously they went door-knocking in their locality without any results, so they did not want to do it anymore.
[66]  CHAPTER EIGHT THE NEW WAY PRODUCING THE NEW MAN, AND
[67]  THE NEW MAN WALKING THE NEW WAY THE NEW WAY THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY
[68]  The Lord s commission to us can be divided into four main items: the gospel, the truth, life, and the church.
[69]  In order to carry out these four items, we have found a most scriptural way through our more than sixty years of experience in the Lord s recovery and the practices of all the different Christian groups in the past two thousand years.
[70]  THE SPECIFIC PRACTICE OF THE NEW WAY Producing One Full-timer
[71]  According to our observations and experiences, we believe that since all the full-timers spend most of their time meeting on the Lord s Day, they do not have to go door-knocking on that day, but they should go door-knocking every day of the rest of the week.
[72]  CHAPTER NINE THE RECOVERY OF EVERYONE FUNCTIONING THE PRACTICE OF ONLY GIVING MESSAGES
[73]  A few decades have gone by, and we have been listening to messages, going to trainings, and participating in certain services, yet if the Lord comes back today, are we able to settle accounts with Him?
[74]  I sought before the Lord, what should we do if we do not take the way of Christianity?
[75]  The Lord then showed me that, first, the church life is not in the big meetings.
[76]  The training in door-knocking and gospel preaching in Taipei is very strict, with definite principles guiding our timing and the content of our speaking.
[77]  For example, we can leave if the door is not opened within half a minute after knocking.
