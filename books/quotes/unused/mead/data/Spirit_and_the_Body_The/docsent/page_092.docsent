   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DIVISION AND CONFUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The history of Christianity is a history of divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What a shame the divisions in Christianity are to the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Christianity there is division upon division.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christians are known for the fact that they are easily divided.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Consider how many Christian divisions there are in the city of Cleveland.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On just one street there may be a number of divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On one corner there may be the Church of Christ, and on another, the Assembly of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How easy it is for Christians to be divided!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It seems that anyone can start something and call it a church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What lawlessness!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is Babel, the source of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today the whole of Christianity is a great Babel, which means confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some Christians are arguing that we should not say that they are in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But they need to see that as long as they are a division, they are Babylonian.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Division denotes confusion, and confusion is the basic characteristic of Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As long as you are in division, you are in confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As long as you are in confusion, you are Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Every denomination is Babylonian, and every division is part of Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Catholic Church, the Protestant denominations, and all the independent groups are in a condition of confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All are Babylonian.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>CHRIST, THE UNIQUE HUSBAND</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In a spiritual sense, division is fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Fornication is a lawless act.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is according to God's ordination for a woman to have a husband, but she must take a husband within the bounds of God's ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Anything other than God's ordination is fornication, lawlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Fornication produces confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church, the wife, must have one husband, and that husband is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But for the church to be divided indicates that the church has more than one husband.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You may ask who is the husband other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you look at today's Christianity, you will see that every group has a different husband with a different name.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When those in the Lutheran denomination call themselves Lutherans, they indicate that they are married to Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Luther was a servant of God, but no church should be of Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the Corinthians were saying, "I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ," Paul said, "Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>1 Cor 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul seemed to be saying, "You are not of me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ is the unique husband.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All of you are of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 2 Corinthians 11:2 Paul even used the word husband: "I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Any person, thing, or matter other than Christ that becomes the basis of a Christian group is another husband.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To have such a husband is to commit fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How many husbands there are today in Christianity!</S>
