(Please note that "young" refers to spiritual age not actual age.) We have covered what they should do so that they can be perfected and grow in God. Last week we spoke on confession and its necessity for our growth before God. Today we will speak on another matter which young Christians should pay attention to. Some people may take this matter lightly, but every experienced person knows the importance of this matter.</P><P>Rising up late in the morning is a great loss to a Christian. The Bible shows us that if we sleep too much, our spiritual life will suffer loss. Brothers and sisters, why does God give us days? They are like the pages of a book, which are blank on one side and black on the other side. Do you know why there is day and night? Do you know why day and night interpose each other? Why must there be a day between two nights? We believe that life is too long. If we tried to write down everything on one page, it would be black with ink. Life is too long; therefore, one page is not enough.</P><P>The life that God gives us contains page after page. Every page is blank on one side; it is a new and fresh beginning. Many times, night is a time of blessing. But it is also a time of curse. When we are tired, we can rest at night. We may fall, become weak, and dirty a page. But thank the Lord that there is a night in which to turn the page, so that we can start a new page. Do not think that rising up every morning is an insignificant thing. Every morning when we rise up, we turn a new page, and we have a new beginning. If we want to measure a Christian's growth, all we have to do is to ask when he rises up in the morning. Some say that they rise up very early, but actually they rise up at eight o'clock. Some may even rise up at eleven or twelve o'clock. But I have to give you my own testimony, and I must say a strong word to you in this matter. Please do not be offended by my frankness. A Christian who rises up late cannot make any progress at all. I am not saying this hastily. I know what I am saying. All those who have some experience know what I am saying. Which do you love more, your bed or the Lord? Brothers and sisters, do you not realize that our bed is the place of our failure? If we sleep too much, every page of our life will become pitch black. Let us consider this subject in the following sections.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PATTERN OF EARLY RISING</H2><P>Genesis 19:27 says, "And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord." Abraham was an early riser. He rose up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord. If you want God to speak to you, you have to go early in the morning to the place where Jehovah speaks with you.</P><P>Genesis 22:3 says, "And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him." The previous day God had spoken to him, and on this day he obeyed. The previous day God made a demand, and on this day, he consecrated himself to God. He did not go there to seek for blessing, but to obey God and consecrate himself to Him. Those who want to obey God must rise up early.</P><P>Genesis 28:18-19 says, "And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it. And he called the name of that place Bethel." Jacob dreamed of a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. This ladder reaches from earth to heaven, and not from heaven to earth. It typifies the way man draws near to God in the coming kingdom. When Jacob woke from his dream, he rose up early in the morning, took the stone that he had put for his pillows, set it up for a pillar, poured oil upon the top of it, and called the name of the place Bethel. The name Bethel is made up of two parts; Beth means a house, while el means God. Bethel means the house of God. Those who desire to fellowship with God must rise up early.</P><P>Exodus 8:20 says, "And the Lord said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord, Let my people go, that they may serve me." Moses received the command from the Lord to rise up early to do something. Those who want to obey the Lord's command and those who want to testify for Jehovah must rise up early.</P><P>Exodus 24:4 says, "And Moses wrote all the words of the Lord, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel." All those who desire to build altars and communicate with God have to rise up early.</P><P>Exodus 34:4 says, "And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as the Lord had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone." In order to go up to Mount Sinai and receive the commandments from the Lord the second time, Moses had to rise up early.</P><P>Joshua 3:1 says, "Then Joshua rose early in the morning; and they departed from Shittim and came to the Jordan, he and all the children of Israel; and they stayed there overnight, before they crossed over." To lead God's people into Canaan, one must rise up early. Joshua had to lead the people over the Jordan into Canaan, and he had to rise up early. Those who rise up late are not qualified to be the leaders.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 21: The Christian (1934-1940) &nbsp; pg 23</div><br></body></html>
