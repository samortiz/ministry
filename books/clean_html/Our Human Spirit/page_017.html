<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT OF MAN AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD</h2><p>First Corinthians 2:11 says that only the spirit of man knows the things of a man. Many people who are highly educated don’t know what they are, who they are, where they are, or where they are going. Only the spirit of man knows the things of a man. You have to go to your spirit.<p>If you have some problem with your husband, you have to go to the spirit. If you have some problem with your wife, go to the spirit! Then you will know! The spirit of man knows! Your spirit knows! If you are not clear about what you have to do with your wife, your husband, your children, or your brothers, go to your spirit. If you don’t know how to deal with your brothers in the Lord, go to your spirit. If you don’t know what to do with the church problems, with a church matter, go to your spirit. The spirit of man knows because it is the reality of man. Also, the Spirit of God reveals the things of God, and the situation, the condition of man, to man in his spirit (1 Cor. 2:11-12). So if we are going to know the things of man and the things of God, we have to come to our spirit. It is here that we know the things of man, and it is here that we see the things of God. We all have to come to our spirit. Then we are persons in the spirit, spiritual men and not soulish men. The soulish man receives not the things of the Spirit of God (1 Cor. 2:14). The soulish man is a man governed by his mentality. When we turn to the spirit and when we stay in the spirit we become spiritual men.<h2 class=head1>THREE KINDS OF PERSONS</h2><p>In 1 Corinthians 2:13-16 and 3:1-3 there are three kinds of persons: spiritual, soulish, and fleshy. The soulish person is one who lives according to his mind, emotion, or will. He doesn’t know or care for his spirit. He just lives, works, and walks according to his soul. The fleshy person is one that walks and lives according to the lust of the fallen body, the flesh.<p>A fleshy person so easily criticizes, condemns, and scorns other people. Another person may be so nice, always careful, full of consideration, and caring for others. Even if I were so poor, so bad, and so ugly, this nice person wouldn’t say a bad word about me. Yet this nice person may still be a soulish man because he may not even know that he has a spirit. He may be working on his Ph.D. in sociology, and learning how to be humane by exercising his mind. On the other hand, a spiritual man is one that walks not according to the flesh, nor according to anything of the soul, but according to the spirit. Now he is a spiritual man, so he has the spiritual discernment; he can know the spiritual things and he can even know all the things of man. A spiritual man is a wise man. The more you live in the spirit, the more you have the wise discernment of all things, even the things of God.
