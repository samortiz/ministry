These items are the property of your husband or your family members. Household decorations and ornaments can be retained as long as they are tasteful and not too extravagant. Follow the principle of keeping what is practical. It is all right to keep things that are reasonable and tasteful, but it is wrong to go beyond this principle. Objects like ivory antiques should not be kept for display in the house. These things do not have any practical value. We have to carefully consider what we want to buy. It may be better to use the money to print or purchase gospel tracts instead. A certain brother loved to collect ivory antiques before he was saved. He loved them so much that he would sleep with them. Others talk to their wives before going to bed; this brother looked at his antiques before going to bed. He loved his wife, but that love could not match his love for his antiques. Every night he looked at his antiques until midnight. When he woke up he fondled them for another two or three hours. But thank God, the Lord saved him. After he was delivered from these things, he declared, "The Lord has taken away my love for ivory antiques. These objects are beautiful, but the Lord has saved me. What a release it is to be delivered from these antiques!" I hope that no useless, valuable objects would be found in a Christian's home. If we have the financial means, we can buy something practical and tasteful, but a Christian should not collect expensive antiques in his home.</p><p>A sister consecrated her piano, and two other sisters consecrated their sewing machines. The piano can be stored in the meeting hall; we can use it at a later date. The sewing machines can also be stored in the meeting hall. In the future we can make them available to the saints. I am not saying that it is wrong to have items such as a piano or sewing machine in the house. But if others do not have them, it is not good for us to have them just for ourselves. When everyone has them, it is quite all right for us to have them. Christians do not practice asceticism; they practice the denial of the self. When all the brothers and sisters have these things, I will have them, but I should not be so impatient that I must have them immediately.</p><h2 class="head2">Dealing with the Lust for Shopping</h2><p>The greatest temptation facing housewives is shopping or the habit of shopping. Some objects are acquired only because the eyes need them. They are good to look at, but the husband and family have no need of them, even though the eyes have need of them. The more she buys, the more closet and drawer space she needs. Eventually, she runs out of space for the things she needs; all the spaces are filled with objects that only satisfy the lust of the eyes. One sister bought a bed sheet which she did not use for four or five years. She bought a dozen stockings which she kept unused in her closet for a year. This puts money in a dead place. A housewife must overcome the lust of shopping. Otherwise, she will want to buy what she likes when there is some money in her pocket. This is a buying lust. She buys something only for the purpose of looking at it. This is the lust of the eyes. She has to overcome this. When she stands in front of a department store with money in her pocket, she should ask, "Am I about to buy something practical and useful, or is it only for display?" A Christian should always reject the lust of buying. Except for meeting some immediate need, we should not buy anything too quickly.</p><h2 class="head2">Cutting Our Expenses for the Gospel's Sake</h2><p>The housewives should discuss with their husbands how much they should spend a month and how much pocket money should be set aside. After taking care of the normal expenses, all excess should be saved and offered up. This does not mean that a housewife has to lower the quality of the food. It means that she should save what can be saved in order to offer it to the Lord. She should not neglect proper nutrition for her husband and children.</p><p>If she has too many garments, she should sell some. Any dress that is too nice should be sold. She should not live in rags, but neither should she be overly adorned. A housewife always should have a seasonal clean-up. She should consider how much can be saved and how much can be given away. It is best to designate a specific amount of offering for the gospel each month.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_073.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_075.html">Next</a> </body></html>
