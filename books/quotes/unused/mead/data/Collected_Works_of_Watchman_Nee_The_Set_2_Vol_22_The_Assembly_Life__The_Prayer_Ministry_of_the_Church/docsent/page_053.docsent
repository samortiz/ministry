   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Third Thing:</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"Do Not Bring Us into Temptation,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>but Deliver Us from the Evil One"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first part speaks of our material needs.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The second part speaks of our relationship with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This part speaks of our relationship with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"Do not bring us into temptation."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the negative request.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"But deliver us from the evil one."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the positive request.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the one hand, when we live for God on earth and have a strong desire to be for His name, His kingdom, and His will, we have material needs; we need to ask for our daily bread.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the other hand, our conscience needs to be clean and void of offense before God; we need God to forgive our debts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But there is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We also need peace; we need to ask God to deliver us from the hands of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Brothers and sisters, the more we take the way of the kingdom of the heavens, the greater the temptations will be.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What then should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can pray and ask God not to "bring us into temptation."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Brothers and sisters, we cannot be so confident in ourselves that we can scorn any temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Since the Lord has asked us to pray, we should pray that God would not bring us into temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We do not know when temptation will come.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But we can pray ahead of time that we not be brought into temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This prayer is for our protection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are not waiting every day for temptation to come.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, we are praying every day for temptation not to come.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should ask that we only encounter what the Lord allows to come upon us and not encounter anything that the Lord does not allow to come upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we do not pray this way, we will not be able to withstand temptation for a moment; we will not be able to accomplish anything.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must ask the Lord to not bring us into any temptation, not allowing us to encounter anyone that we should not encounter nor to come across anything that we should not come across.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is a protective prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Brothers and sisters, we have to pray for God to protect us so that our daily bread is provided, our conscience is clean, and we do not face temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In everything, we have to ask the Lord not to bring us into temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should pray that we do not encounter anything that the Lord has not permitted.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Daily, we have to ask God to keep us from temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Not only do we have to ask God not to bring us into temptation, but we also have to ask Him to "deliver us from the evil one."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is a positive prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No matter where Satan puts his hand, we have to ask the Lord to deliver us from the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In our daily bread, in the matter of condemnation in our conscience, and in any temptation, we have to ask the Lord to deliver us from the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In other words, we pray that we not fall into the hand of the evil one in anything.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In reading Matthew 8 and 9, we find that Satan's hands are beyond what we expect and know.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They are hidden behind the fever which comes suddenly upon a person's body 8:14 and the storm which rises suddenly from the sea 8:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They cause the demons to attach themselves to men and drown the pigs 8:28-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They work within man's heart and cause him to reject and oppose the Lord for no reason at all 9:3, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In short, Satan is out to harm man and inflict suffering on man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, we have to pray that we will be delivered from the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The three desires concerning God are basic prayers, and the three requests for ourselves are protective prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We ask the Lord for our daily bread not only because we want to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We ask that our conscience be without offense not only for the sake of having a good conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We ask the Lord to deliver us from the evil one not only because we want to be delivered from the harm of the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We pray for all of these things in order to live longer on earth to perform the work of prayer so that the Father's name will be sanctified, His kingdom will come, and His will will be done on earth as in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>THREE THINGS TO GIVE PRAISE FOR</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Lastly, the Lord taught us to give praise for three things: "For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This praise tells us that the kingdom belongs to the Father, the power belongs to the Father, and the glory belongs to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The three things that we give praise for have to do with deliverance from the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They also have to do with the whole prayer that the Lord taught.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We pray that the Lord would deliver us from the evil one because the kingdom is the Father's and not Satan's, because the power is the Father's and not Satan's, and because the glory is the Father's and not Satan's. This is the main point: since the kingdom belongs to the Father, we should not fall into the hand of Satan; since the power belongs to the Father, we should not fall into the hand of Satan; and since the glory belongs to the Father, we should not fall into the hand of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the strong reason behind not falling into Satan's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we fall into Satan's hand, how can we glorify the Father any longer?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If the Father is to have power over us, Satan cannot have power over us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Since the kingdom of the heavens belongs to the Father, we cannot and should not fall into Satan's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Concerning authority, we should remember the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He said, "Behold, I have given you the authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you" Luke 10:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This verse says that the authority He gives enables us to overcome all the power of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>With authority there is power.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord wants us to know that with the kingdom, there is authority, and behind the authority, the power to rule.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The kingdom is God's and not Satan's. Authority belongs to God, not to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Consequently, power belongs to God, not to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Of course, glory also belongs to God, not to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Since the kingdom, the power, and the glory all belong to God, those who belong to God should overcome all temptation and be delivered from the hand of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the New Testament, the Lord's name denotes authority, while the Holy Spirit denotes power.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>All authority is in the Lord's name, while all power is in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Holy Spirit is the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The kingdom denotes the rule of heaven and the authority of God, while the power tells us that all power is in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When God moves, the Holy Spirit becomes His power.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Since the kingdom belongs to God, Satan has nowhere to exercise his reign.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Since the power belongs to the Holy Spirit, Satan can in no way touch the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Matthew 12:28 tells us that whenever the demons touched the Holy Spirit, they were cast out.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Finally, glory also belongs to God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Hence, we can declare and loudly give praise: "For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The Lord taught us to pray in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This does not mean that we should recite it as a ritualistic ceremony, but pray according to this pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>All prayers should be according to this pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Concerning God, we desire that His name be sanctified, His kingdom come, and His will be done on earth as in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Concerning ourselves, we ask that God would protect us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Concerning our praise, it is based on the fact that the kingdom, the power, and the glory are His.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Since the kingdom, the power, and the glory are His, His name should be sanctified, His kingdom should come, and His will should be done on earth as in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Since the kingdom, the power, and the glory are His, we pray to Him concerning our daily bread, our debt, our temptation, and the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Every prayer should take this prayer as its pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Some have said that this prayer is not for Christians because it does not end with the words "in the name of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This is foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The prayer that the Lord teaches is not an incantation that we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>What prayer in the New Testament ends with the words "in the name of the Lord"?</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>When the disciples were on the boat, and they cried, "Lord, save us; we are perishing" Matt 8:25 , did they end with the words "in the name of the Lord"?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The Lord did not teach us to say these words.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>He taught us to pray according to this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>He taught us the way to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>He did not tell us to pray with these words.</S>
