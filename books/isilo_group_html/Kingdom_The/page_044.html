These words "take no thought" are very meaningful. In the early morning we are tempted to take thought. But at that time, take no thought. Take no thought about the leading brothers. Take no thought about the sisters or about your roommate or about your wife. The more you take thought about your wife, the more you may condemn her. Take no thought about your husband. On all occasions and in every circumstance, take no thought, but cooperate with the Spirit. If the worldly people were to take no thought, they would have nothing to speak because they do not have the Spirit of the Father, but we do have Him. Therefore, we should take no thought and simply follow the Spirit. If you continue to take thought about your wife, after three months you may have many problems. The same is true about the wives taking thought of their husbands. Take no thought about your husband, but go along with the Spirit. Then, day after day you will say, "Hallelujah, Praise the Lord!" We have something better than our own thoughts. We have something more prevailing, something that is high and rich and living&#151;the Triune God. The Spirit of the Father is the application of the Triune God. We have the Triune God in our spirit. This is the kingdom. When you take no thought, Satan stops. When you cooperate with the Spirit, Satan trembles. Then you have victory. To take no thought and to go along with the Spirit is the kingdom of God. When the Lord cast out demons by the Spirit of God, it meant that the kingdom of God had come. As long as you cooperate with the Spirit, you are in the kingdom.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SET THE MIND ON THE SPIRIT</H2><P>We are all familiar with Romans 8:6. To set the mind on the flesh is death. Death is a matter of the satanic kingdom. To set the mind on the spirit is life and peace. These are matters of the kingdom of God. If we set our mind on the spirit, we are in the kingdom of God. But when we set our mind upon the flesh, we are in the kingdom of Satan. Whether we remain in the kingdom of Satan or the kingdom of God depends absolutely on where we set our minds. To set our mind upon the flesh is to be in the kingdom of Satan; to set our mind upon the spirit is to be in the kingdom of God. If we set our mind upon the flesh, all the demons will rise up and swarm. However, if we set our mind upon the spirit, the demons will be gone. To set the mind upon the spirit really casts out the demons. "But if I by the Spirit of God cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God is come upon you" (Matt. 12:28). The practicality of the kingdom life is simply to set our mind upon the spirit and to go along with the indwelling Spirit. We have a way to live the kingdom life. The practicality of the kingdom life is in the spirit. When we live the kingdom life, we take no thought and we set our mind upon the spirit.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_043.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_045.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Kingdom &nbsp; pg 44</div><br></body></html>
