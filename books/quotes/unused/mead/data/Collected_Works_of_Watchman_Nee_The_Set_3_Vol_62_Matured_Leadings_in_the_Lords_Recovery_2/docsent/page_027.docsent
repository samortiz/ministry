   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Lesson of the Rod Turning into a Serpent</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let me first speak on the miracle of the rod turning into a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To Moses, the first function of a rod was for shepherding the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Later, it was used for leading the Israelites on in their journey.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At that time Moses was eighty years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The rod was his support, a necessity for his existence.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although we may not have an actual rod in our hands, we all have something upon which our livelihood depends.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A merchant may have his business as a rod.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A student may have his studies as a rod.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A wife may have her husband as a rod.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our rod is what we depend upon.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is our very support.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have many rods.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They may be our parents, education, business, or money.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These can be very useful and can be of service to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But once we touch God, we will see that these rods upon which our livelihood depends must be cast to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From my own calling and from the calling of other useful servants of the Lord, I can see that in order for a man to be used by the Lord, he must first cast away the rod he holds in his hand.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once the rod is cast on the ground, the serpent hidden behind the rod is exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The serpent is hidden behind the rod all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By casting the rod on the ground, the true form of the serpent is exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This miracle shows us that under God's shining and the operation of His power, the rod of our support is exposed of its true serpentine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The serpent has been coming to us in disguise from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From the Old Testament until the time of Revelation, the serpent always disguises himself behind, below, or between certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His goal is to occupy and usurp the man created for God's own purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Moses' eyes the rod was his support, but in God's eyes it was the embodiment of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Its purpose was to occupy and usurp man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When Moses cast the rod down and saw that it had become a serpent, he fled from it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He dared not touch it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God told him to take the serpent by the tail, and the serpent became a rod in his hand once again.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before this time, Moses had been holding that rod for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was something very precious to him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But when he cast it on the ground, he discovered that it was a serpent, something that had occupied him for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This experience showed him that his past support was nothing but a serpent, something that was hurting him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Please notice that God did not tell Moses to discard the rod, but to cast it on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The purpose of this casting was to reveal the true nature of the rod.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then God told Moses to take the rod, which had become the serpent, by the tail.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Nanking one responsible brother was a businessman.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Later he saw the danger of going into business, and he dared not touch it again.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But God does not say to discard the rod, but to take it by the tail.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must still have the rod, but we have to take it by the tail.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the past the rod was our center.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today the Lord has to be our center.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the past we struggled for our living.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today we strive for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the province of Shangtung, an elderly brother once said that his wife, his lifelong companion, was an old serpent, and his children were little serpents.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He was ensnared and could not serve the Lord or consecrate himself to the gospel freely.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He became afraid of the serpents and dared not take them up by the tail.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But the Lord does not tell us to discard the rod and give it up forever.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is easy to drop the rod.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is easy to migrate to northwest China for the gospel and to leave the wife, the children, and all the serpents, large and small, behind.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But the Lord does not tell us to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Instead, He wants us to put forth our hand and take the serpent by the tail.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After the true nature of the hidden serpent is exposed, we have to grab it by the tail.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the best way to deal with the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we take a serpent by the head, it will bite us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But if we can turn it around and take it by the tail, it will lose its power and become limp.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the end it will become a channel through which we exercise our authority; it will control us no longer Exo 4:4, 17; Luke 10:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we cannot take it by the tail, we will not have any authority.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The four Gospels say that in order to follow the Lord, we have to forsake our parents, children, etc. Matt 19:29 . In the Epistles, Paul says that we have to love our parents and honor them Eph 6:1-3 . The forsaking in the Gospels is the casting down of the rod, while the teaching in Ephesians is the taking up of the rod by the tail.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This rod becomes the rod of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Eventually, Moses performed all the miracles in Egypt and led the children of Israel out of Egypt with this rod.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Over two hundred brothers and sisters have handed themselves over in the church in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The first lesson you have to learn is to cast all that you have and all your support on the ground and then take it by the tail.</S>
