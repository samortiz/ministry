   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN THE CENTRAL VISION 2 CHRIST AS THE MYSTERY OF GOD Scripture Reading: Col 1:25-27; 2:2, 9; Rom 9:5; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17-18; Rom 8:9-11; Eph 3:14-19; 2 Cor 13:14</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before we continue with the central vision of the Apostle Paul s completing ministry, I would like to tell you some of my history in the hope that you will see my gradual realization of the importance of this vision.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A GRADUAL ENLIGHTENING</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I was born into organized Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After I grew up, I got saved.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It was a marvelous conversion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I began to seek the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I loved the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then I was attracted to the Brethren assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It was their familiarity with the Bible that drew me.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I stayed with them for seven and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I learned their teachings on prophecy from Daniel, Matthew, 2 Thessalonians, and Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We were also taught about the Old Testament types and their fulfillment in the New.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, we were repeatedly charged not to do anything that was not scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must not celebrate Christmas nor birthdays; both were unscriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Again and again we heard that this was scriptural and that that was not scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Never did I hear a word concerning God s operating in us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Their Bible seemed not to contain Philippians 2:13: For it is God Who operates in you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hebrews 13:21 was also missing: that the God of peace is doing in us that which is well-pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the famous Brethren teaching nothing was ever said about God in us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>About Christ s indwelling us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>About the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Occasionally there would be mention of the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I recount this background to you so that you can see how the Lord has gradually showed many things to us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I received much help throughout the years from Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then for these past thirty years or so I have been abroad.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The vision I see today is far clearer than it was thirty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>LIVING IN THE CIRCLES OF OUR NATURAL CONCEPTS</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nonetheless, however much light we have received, we must all admit that our daily practical life is still around those eleven off concepts we covered in the previous message.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those concepts are like circles, closing us in and limiting us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not bad to think about God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Surely there is nothing wrong with worshipping our Creator and trying to please and even glorify Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Man s ethical concepts also seem commendable.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Within man there is a God-created good nature.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Of course it was corrupted, but that good element is still in us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the one hand, we are accustomed to sinning; on the other, we have an intention to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These moral inclinations are our ethical concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We may, for instance, get angry and quarrel with a member of the family.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Later, however, when we are quiet, we are sorry about it and remind ourselves that we must love our family.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We may not even quarrel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Under our parents discipline we have learned not to fight; thus, the annoyance remains inside us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At the breakfast table we may be exasperated with our younger sister.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By midmorning, however, the thought comes, Oh, I must love my sister; she is younger than I. Then we pray, Lord, help me to love my sister from now on.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Later, perhaps while we are at the dining table in the evening, again something comes up, and again the feeling of annoyance comes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then, perhaps in the meeting that night, we hear something in a message, and the thought returns, Oh, I must love my sister; Lord, help me to love her.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Is not this the story of all of us?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It illustrates our ethical behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then there are our religious, devotional concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We want to be pious or holy or spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These are some of the concepts we hold.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We may want to have everything according to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As fundamental Christians, we take the Bible as our guideline.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Being scriptural is another concept.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There are also the concepts of wanting to have power and of being able to perform the miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How easy it is to be impressed when we hear of some miraculous happening!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To serve God is another widely held concept.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some thirty or forty years ago many young American Christians devoted themselves to mission work.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To be a missionary on the foreign field was considered the highest career.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Do you believe that you are out of these concepts?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Day by day all of us, including myself, still travel in all these places.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We try to have a good meeting, to stir up the saints to function; this is the concept of having a good meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We want to build up the service groups, to get the hall cleaned, the lawn mowed; this is the concept of Saturday morning service.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I know the elders might not be happy to hear this; they think I am undoing the church service!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Many times I have confessed, Lord, I have been good to this one or to that one, but without You.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We may be devotional, but apart from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We may faithfully participate in the church service, but with very little of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We are His container; as such, we should take Him as our contents.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should not act in an empty way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As His vessels, we should be filled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Whatever we do must be an expression of Him.</S>
