   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>KEEPING OUR SPIRIT LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Certain verses in chapter five of 1 Thessalonians help us to see that the first way to preserve our spirit is to keep it living through proper exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verses 16 through 19 say, "Always rejoice; unceasingly pray; in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Do not quench the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To rejoice, pray, and give thanks are to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we exercise our spirit in this way, we cause it to be living.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Exercising the spirit to keep it living is the first way to preserve it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No one likes to have any kind of illness or disease in his physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you become ill, you certainly will not want your body to remain in a sick condition.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the contrary, you will do everything possible to bring your body out of such an unhealthy situation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Likewise, we should not leave our spirit in a deadened condition.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should struggle to have our spirit freed from that kind of condition.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How can we release our spirit from a situation of deadness?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We can do it through exercising our spirit by rejoicing, praying, and thanking.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do you realize that to be quiet is to keep your spirit in a deadened condition?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you allow your spirit to remain in a situation of death, this means that you do not cooperate with the sanctifying God to preserve your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because of the fall, our spirit has been deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our spirit, therefore, must overcome the problem of deadness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many times the saints attend the church meetings in death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When they attend the meeting, they sit in their chair with a deadened spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But other parts of their being may be very active.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For example, in their thoughts they may criticize the testimonies given by others; they may think that some testimonies are not real and that others are full of oldness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although these saints criticize others, they do not preserve their own spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Instead of preserving their spirit, they allow it to remain in a deadened condition.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I wish to emphasize strongly the fact that to preserve our spirit is first of all to exercise it in order to pull it out of death.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The spirit of an unbeliever is absolutely dead.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Most of those around you at school, at work, or in your neighborhood are utterly dead in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many of your relatives, perhaps members of your immediate family, are also dead in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Have you been sanctified, separated, from a spirit-deadening situation?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many saints have not been separated in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the reason they never pray or praise the Lord in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They do not rejoice or give thanks.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Instead of praising the Lord with the exercise of the spirit, they prefer to save their face by leaving their spirit in a deadened condition.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some may say to themselves, "I am a cultured person.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I must cause others to realize that I am refined and have a high education.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, I shall sit quietly in the meeting in a cultured way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Let the young people and those who are not well educated shout praises in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I don't care to behave in such a way."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If this is your attitude, your spirit will remain deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Furthermore, as far as the condition of your spirit is concerned, you are not sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You are common, for you keep company with those who are dead in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This habit of allowing our spirit to remain in death has even invaded the church meetings in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I am not encouraging anyone to behave in an unruly manner in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>My point is that we need to pull our spirit out of death and cooperate with the operation of the Triune God in sanctifying us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He wants to separate all of us from those whose spirits are deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because we have been regenerated, we need to be different.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to show that our spirit is living, that it is not deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus, our spirit should rejoice, pray, and give thanks to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>KEEPING OUR SPIRIT FROM DEFILEMENT</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Another way to preserve our spirit is found in 2 Corinthians 7:1.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In this verse Paul says, "Having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This verse indicates that we should abstain from all defilement of both flesh and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need to stay away from anything that contaminates our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the reason we should keep our eyes from looking at evil things, such as defiling pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Such pictures defile not only our eyes; they also defile our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is something I have learned from experience.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In 1933 I visited Shanghai the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The church had two meeting halls then, one in western Shanghai and the other in northern Shanghai, quite far from each other.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For transportation we often used the streetcar.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The ride from western Shanghai to northern Shanghai took more than an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The first few times I took this ride in the streetcar I looked around at the various sights on the main street.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But when I arrived at the meeting hall, I realized that my spirit was deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It had been deadened by my looking at so many things on the street.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>From this I learned to close my eyes and pray when taking the ride by streetcar.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This preserved my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Because I learned to preserve my spirit in this way, when I arrived at the meeting hall in northern Shanghai, my spirit was living.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I had truly been sanctified in my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If you become contaminated by looking at certain kinds of pictures, your spirit will be defiled, contaminated, and deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As a result, you will not be able to pray unless you first ask the Lord to cleanse you from all defilement.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I offer this as an illustration of our need to cooperate with the sanctifying Triune God to have our spirit preserved from deadness and contamination.</S>
