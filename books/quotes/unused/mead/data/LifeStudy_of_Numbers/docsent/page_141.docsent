   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS MESSAGE THIRTY-SEVEN FIGHTING 6 Scripture Reading: Num 26:1-65</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God created the universe in such a way that we have both day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The principle is the same in our spiritual experiences: we have both nights and days.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The experience described in Numbers 25 was in the night, but in Numbers 26 we have something related to the day.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>V. THE RENUMBERING OF THE PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Chapter twenty-six is devoted to the renumbering of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A. After the Purification by the Plague</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>on the Fornicators and Idolaters</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The renumbering in chapter twenty-six took place immediately after the purification by the plague on the fornicators and idolaters v. 1a . The failure in chapter twenty-five was the greatest failure of God's people in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is proved by the fact that twenty-four thousand people died by the plague 25:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This plague was a purification of God's people, and this purification was a sifting that dealt with the mixture among them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Numbers 11:4 speaks of "the mixed multitude."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates that among the congregation of the children of Israel there was a mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some impure ones had become mixed with the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since the history of Israel is a complete type of the church, the mixture among the children of Israel is a type of the mixture in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There will often be some kind of mixture in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even with the apostles chosen by the Lord Jesus there was one Judas who was not pure.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Acts 5 indicates that, at the very beginning of the church life, there was mixture in the church in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The mixture there was with Ananias and Sapphira, who were genuine believers but were not pure.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, the last of the epistles written by Paul, 2 Timothy, has much to say concerning mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some, like Alexander the coppersmith 1 Tim 1:20; 2 Tim 4:14-15 , hated Paul and opposed him to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many of those in Asia who had been raised up by Paul turned away from his ministry 1:15 , and Demas, a co-worker, because of his love for the present age, forsook Paul 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The point here is that there is mixture among God's people, and God uses the failure and turmoil among His people to purify them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After the great failure in Numbers 25, the children of Israel were purified.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The punishment in chapter twenty-five was the last purification of the children of Israel before they entered into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The twenty-four thousand who were killed by the plague should have included some of those who had been condemned for their failure in chapter fourteen.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Those who survived all the purifications in the wilderness, especially the last and greatest purification, were a purified people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These purified ones needed to be renumbered.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This renumbering implies some amount of replacement and re-formation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There was the need to replace all those in the army who had died.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Also, there was the need for the army to be re-formed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>From this we see that the renumbering was very significant.</S>
