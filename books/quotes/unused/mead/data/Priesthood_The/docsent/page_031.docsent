   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXPRESSION THROUGH ENJOYMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that the first item of the living of the priests is to feast on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This means to take Christ in. Day by day we have at least three meals in which we do nothing but take in food.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whatever we take into us by our eating eventually becomes a part of us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the past we have all taken in a lot of chicken, eggs, meat, potatoes, and many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Where are the chickens now?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Where are the eggs?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are now both the chickens and the eggs.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That is, our physical being has become a composite of all the things we have ever eaten.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The living of the priesthood is primarily to take in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we are to realize the priesthood, we must know how to take Christ in day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then whatever we eat of Him will become our very constituent.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Secondly, we have seen that the Christ whom we have taken in becomes our manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is our clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The food we take in is the inner supply, and the clothing we wear is the outer expression of what we have taken in. If we feed on Christ all day, eventually He will be expressed from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The more we eat of Him, the more He will be expressed, and this expression is the clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As we enjoy Christ daily, we will express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What we enjoy is Christ taken within, and what we express is Christ manifested without.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This manifestation is the heavenly, spiritual clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The clothing of the priest is mainly composed of five different elements: gold, fine linen, blue, purple, and scarlet.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The expression of Christ through us is manifested in these five ways.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First of all, Christ should be manifested through us as the gold, which represents the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must give others the impression that we have in us something better than humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the gold, the divine life, the nature of God Himself expressed through us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The expression of Christ in our daily living must have these elements.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Others will realize that we are not only human beings, but that we have something higher, something which no human words can express.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This spiritual gold that is in us is not our natural behavior, but something divine, something of the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Next, our expression of Christ must also have the fine linen, which signifies the pure righteousness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must be so pure, so righteous, and so just.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If Christ is in us and we enjoy Him as our life, we will be so honest, so righteous, and so pure.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All human beings, even the most moral ones, are not so pure or so just.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But the priesthood is a real expression of honesty, justice, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The priesthood must also express the blue, which signifies heavenliness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are living on the earth, but we are not earthly persons; we are heavenly persons.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are persons of the heavens and even persons in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Does our living have the expression of the heavenly blue?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There must also be the expression of the purple.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In ancient history purple was the royal color.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All those in a royal family, especially the king, wore purple clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus purple signifies royalty and kingly dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In our expression of Christ, we must have this kingly dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should not be so mean or common.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sometimes when we deal with others, we lose our dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But if we do live by Christ, we will have the spiritual, divine dignity expressed through us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then there is the scarlet.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After I had been with Brother Watchman Nee for quite a long time, I noticed that whenever we prayed together, he would always utter some deep words about applying the blood of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even at the meeting of the Lord s table, he uttered many deep words to apply the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I always had the sense of the scarlet when I was around him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whenever he prayed, he always applied the blood of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because he knew redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We can never come to the Lord without applying the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Not one of the priests could get into the Holy Place without the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Regardless of whether we sense that we are sinful or not, we are still sinful, for we are still in the old nature, and we are still walking on this dirty earth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In many ways, consciously and unconsciously, we have been defiled and therefore need to apply the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must always be showing others that we cannot live without the scarlet color, meaning that we cannot live without the Lord s redeeming blood.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In our expression of Christ we must give others the impression that we always have the realization we are sinful, defiled, and dirty.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We always need the cleansing of the blood and must give others the sense that we live by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We can never enjoy Christ as our life without applying the blood to cleanse us and to cover us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the expression of Christ we must have the divine nature, the purity and righteousness, the heavenliness, the kingly dignity, and the redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>These are the items in the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we express Him, we will express Him as all these items.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we are ones who are feasting on Christ and enjoying Him day by day, spontaneously we will give others the impression of the divine nature, the purity, the heavenliness, the kingship, and the redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When others contact us or pray with us, they will sense that we are full of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They will sense in us the righteousness and the heavenliness.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The more they talk with us, the more they will feel that they are in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Our presence will simply become the heavens to them.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When we are filled with Christ, we will express the heavenliness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Finally, others will also sense in us His kingship and redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This garment of the priest is the glorious expression of Christ.</S>
