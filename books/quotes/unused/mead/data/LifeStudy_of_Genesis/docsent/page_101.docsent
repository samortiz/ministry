   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PHARAOH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Exodus 1 12 we see how independent Pharaoh was.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He was not only independent; he was rebellious against God, even asking on one occasion, "Who is God?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Exo 5:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Pharaoh did not care for God and he was unwilling to know God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, Pharaoh's heart was hardened.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He hardened his heart and even God hardened his heart Exo 7:13, 22; 8:15, 19, 32; 9:34-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Again and again and again the heart of Pharaoh was hardened.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The people throughout the world today are hardened in their heart because they do not care for God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They care about their councils, plans and plots, but they do not care for God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, God lets go of them and their hearts become hardened.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>AARON</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The name of Aaron is a good name.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although he was the high priest and was on the line of life, Aaron acted according to the line of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>While Moses was on the mount enjoying God as the tree of life, Aaron and the people were at the foot of the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They neither prayed nor looked to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the people proposed to Aaron that he make them gods out of gold, he hearkened to them Exo 32:1, 4, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are times when we should not listen to the people, for the congregation may present a proposal that is against God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Aaron heeded their advice, acting independently to make an idol of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The idol was very attractive; it was not made of clay but of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When Moses had descended from the mountaintop, he asked Aaron what happened.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Aaron replied that he put the gold into the fire and a golden calf came out Exo 32:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Aaron seemed to be defending himself, asking Moses not to condemn him and apparently thinking that he had not done very much.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nevertheless, as long as we are independent of God it does not matter how much we do or fail to do.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As long as we are independent of God the golden calf will appear.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There is no need for us to do very much: simply be independent of God and the result will be a golden calf.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>NADAB AND ABIHU</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Nadab and Abihu offered to God "strange fire" with their incense Lev 10:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although the incense was good, the fire was "strange."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It was not the fire from the altar where the atonement was made.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The fire they used was acceptable to their concept, but it was "strange" to God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This "strange fire," applied in their own way, not according to God's revelation, caused their death.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>IX.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>MIRIAM AND AARON</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because he had married a heathen woman Num 12:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Undoubtedly Moses was wrong in this.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, Miriam and Aaron were opposed to Moses, not as a result of their contacting God, but because of their own motive.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Their opposition to Moses did not have its source in God, but in themselves, in their knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This brought God's wrath upon them, causing Miriam to suffer leprosy and to be shut out of the camp seven days Num 12:9-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The record of the Bible shows us that only one leadership has ever been faultless the leadership of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every other leadership has some shortcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, with any leadership, other than the leadership of the Lord Jesus, there are always mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Nevertheless, we must be very careful about our attack, even if the leadership is wrong.</S>
