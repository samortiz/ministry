   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>This is the other aspect of the dividing of the spirit and the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning the aspect of the soul affecting and controlling the spirit, the work of the cross is to divide the soul from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But concerning the aspect of being filled with the Holy Spirit and letting the spirit have the authority, the work of the cross is to cause the soul to no longer be independent but be one with the spirit completely.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Concerning the experience of our personal living, we should seek that the spirit and the soul become one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we will thus let the cross and the Holy Spirit work deeply, we will then see that what the soul has lost is not even one ten thousandth of what it has gained.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What has died now bears fruit; what was lost is now kept unto eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If our soul-life is under the control of the spirit, we will see that our soul has an extremely great change.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Formerly, because it was for ourselves and because it always wanted to act alone, our soul was, so to speak, lost before God and useless in His hands.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now our soul, although lost on the side of man, is gained on the side of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From now on, we are those spoken of in Hebrews 10:39: "who have faith to the gaining of the soul."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is much deeper than the common saying, "the salvation of the soul."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Here it specifically speaks of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now that the believer has learned not to act or behave by feeling or by what is seen through the eye, he can have faith to save his life to serve God and glorify God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What seemingly is lost is gained in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>James 1 also mentions this saving: "Receive in meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls" v. 21 . When a branch is grafted to a tree, it receives the nature of that tree.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Likewise, when the word of God is engrafted into our life, it transmits its nature to us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By this the tree is saved from being useless and is saved even to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From the word of life we obtain the life of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The branch is not eliminated; rather, it has a new life as its principle of vitality.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All of the soul is still here, yet now it is not the soul-life that makes the faculties of the soul living, but rather the life of the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the true "salvation of the soul."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our human nerves are very sensitive and easily stimulated by outside things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Outward conversations, attitudes, environments, and human relationships can easily touch us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our mind has many thoughts, plans, and imaginations which are truly confused.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our will has many opinions and ideas and loves to do things according to its own whims.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>None of the faculties of our soul-life give us peace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whether individually or collectively, the soul-life causes us to shift from time to time, change often, be disturbed, feel confused, and have no peace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now, however, because our soul is being governed by the spirit, we can be freed from such disturbance.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord Jesus said, "Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls" Matt 11:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we are willing to surrender to the Lord, willing to take His yoke, and willing to walk according to the His will, our soul will not be aroused.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we are willing to imitate the Lord and if we will learn of Him, seeing how the Lord was despised by others and how the Lord followed not His own will but the will of God, then the turmoil in our soul will be calmed down.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The reason sorrow and grief come is that we are not willing to be satisfied with the same kind of treatment that the Lord received and that we are not willing to submit to God's will and arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we put the soul-life to death and completely surrender to the Lord, our soul the soul with sensitive nerves will rest in the Lord and not misunderstand the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The soul under the control of the Holy Spirit is a soul of rest.</S>
