   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE EXERCISE OF OUR HUMAN SPIRIT THE THREE PARTS OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning the creation of man, Genesis 2:7 says, Jehovah God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this verse three things are mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, God formed man from the dust of the ground; this was the forming of man s body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Second, God breathed into this body the breath of life, and third, man became a living soul.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this account of the creation of man, man s body and man s soul are clearly identified; however, it is not clear what the breath of life is that was breathed into man s body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First Thessalonians 5:23 says, The God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This verse portrays man as having three parts: spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The body is the outermost part of man s being, the spirit is the innermost part, and the soul is the medium between the body and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this verse the breath of life mentioned in Genesis 2:7 is clearly identified as the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is confirmed by Job 32:8, which identifies man s spirit with God s breath.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The three parts of man correspond to the three realms in the universe: the physical realm, the spiritual realm, and the psychological realm.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the physical realm there are the material things, which we can contact through the body with its five senses of hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, and touching.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the spiritual realm there is God, who is a Spirit John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There are also the angels of God, who are spirits Heb 1:13-14 ; the enemy, Satan the devil, and the rebellious angels of Satan Matt 25:41 , who are evil spirits; and the demons, who are unclean spirits 12:22, 24, 43 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We can contact the spiritual world, in particular God as the Spirit, by means of the human spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In order to contact anything, we need a certain organ to sense and substantiate it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For instance, it would be impossible to substantiate the sound of a voice without a hearing organ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we were to lose the function of our ears, it would seem that the many voices around us did not exist, because we would have no organ that could substantiate them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Likewise, if we were to lose our sight, we could not substantiate color, and it would seem that such a thing as color did not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although we might know that color exists, to our senses it would not exist, because we would not have the organ to substantiate color.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This explains why unbelievers say that there is no God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To them there is no God simply because they have lost the function of their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>People who have lost the function of their spirit cannot substantiate God, because God is a spiritual being.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to use the right organ to substantiate God, and that organ is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord Jesus tells us in John 4:24 that God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we would know God, touch God, contact God, sense God, and substantiate God, we must use the right organ, that is, our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God created the stomach as the organ for us to receive food and water.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In a similar way, He created the spirit as the organ for us to contact Him and receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We would emphasize the fact that to sense and substantiate anything requires the right organ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For the physical world, God created our body with its senses, and for the spiritual world, in which God is the foremost item, He created a spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is by this spirit that we can contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For this reason, when we pray, we need to stop our whole being and exercise our inner organ, that is, our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should pray not by our memory, nor by our mind, will, or emotion, but by the deepest and innermost part of our being, our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many times we have experienced that the more we think and consider, the more we feel that the Lord is absent.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we exercise our mind and our reasoning too much, we may reach the point where we doubt that the Lord exists.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But when we stop our whole being and exercise our innermost part, we sense the Lord s presence, because we are using the right organ to substantiate Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The soul is the medium between the body and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The word psychology comes from the Greek word psuche, which means soul.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, psychology is related to the soul, and the psychological realm is the soulish realm.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The soul is an organ by which we can sense and substantiate the psychological realm.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Reasoning, anger, and joy belong to this realm.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Both the Scriptures and our experience confirm that man is of three parts: spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hebrews 4:12 also speaks concerning the three parts of man: For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This verse says that the soul and the spirit can be divided, showing that the soul and the spirit are not identical but are two separate parts of man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It also speaks of the joints and the marrow, which are parts of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It goes even further to speak of the heart with its thoughts and intents.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The heart is different from the soul and from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Ezekiel 36:26-27 says, I will also give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you...And I will put My Spirit within you.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In these verses three things are mentioned: a new heart, a new spirit, and God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to differentiate between the soul and the spirit and also between the heart, on the one hand, and the soul and the spirit, on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Furthermore, verse 27 tells us clearly that God has put His Spirit within us.</S>
