   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MESSAGE TEN THE CROSS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 14; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 5:17; Rom 11:24; Gal 2:20; Matt 16:24 THE NEW CREATION BEING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>GOD'S GOAL IN THE OLD CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In His economy, God has two creations, the old creation and the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Chapters one and two of Genesis are a record of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to the New Testament, God's intention in the old creation was to obtain the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is a great difference between these two creations.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The old creation came out of the creating hand of God, but the new creation has God's essence and element within it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God did not get into the old creation with His nature, element, and essence; rather, Satan, God's enemy, worked himself into that creation through man's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That creation became his expression.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God, however, wants an expression through His new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE BRANCHING OUT OF GOD,</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>IN HIS DIVINITY, INTO HUMANITY</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's intention was to gain the new creation for His expression, but to gain this was not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God finished the further creation and restoration of the old creation in six days, but to make the new creation from the old creation is much more difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order to complete the work of the new creation, God had to act in His divine trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In eternity past, there was a conference, a council, among the Three of the Godhead Gen 1:26; Acts 2:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In that conference, it was decided that the Son, the Second of the Godhead, should be the centrality and universality of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In order to accomplish this, the Triune God had to pass through a unique process.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first step of this process was the Son as the embodiment of the Divine Trinity becoming a man through incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Through this step divinity got into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In eternity past the Triune God was merely in divinity, but through incarnation He branched out from His divinity and with His divinity into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He became a particular man with both the divine nature and the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The descendants of Adam had only the human nature, and God in eternity had only the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God was in His divinity, and we, the descendants of Adam, were in our humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God was in His territory of divinity, and we were in our territory of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Before Christ's incarnation, these two territories had nothing to do with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But approximately two thousand years ago, four thousand years after His creation of man, God branched out from and with His divinity into humanity.</S>
