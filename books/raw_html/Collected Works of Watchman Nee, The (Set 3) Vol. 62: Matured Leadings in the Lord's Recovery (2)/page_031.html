<h2 class="head2">Consecration Being a Demand of Life within Us</h2><p>Let me ask Brother Chia why he consecrated himself. (He answers, "Because I love to do it inwardly. This is like a child loving chocolate.") Let me ask you why you love to do it. (He answers, "Because the life within me loves to do it.") That is right. We consecrate ourselves because the life within us loves to do it. When we do it, inwardly we feel happy and joyful. In 1943 we witnessed the tide of handing oneself over in Chefoo. At the end of the previous year, I saw clearly that the matter of money must be settled within God's children. Unless this matter was settled, it would have been impossible for God's gospel to spread, and there would have been no way for the brothers and sisters to have a genuine revival. On December 12, 1942, the Lord did a marvelous work in Chefoo. That afternoon I gave a message on consecration. From that time onward, the Lord began to inwardly touch the brothers and sisters to consecrate their all. This lasted for three and a half months. Six to seven hundred people consecrated their all to the Lord. Some handed themselves over to be sent out for migration. All the brothers and sisters were swept away by this revival. Many people dared not touch their garments when they went home for fear that the Lord would ask them to offer them up as soon as they touched them. The brothers and sisters handed themselves over because they wanted the inward peace. If they had not handed themselves over, they would not have had the peace. The same thing happened in Foochow in 1948. All the brothers and sisters handed themselves over as a result of answering the call of the life within them.</p><p>I can give a little testimony of my own. Twenty-three years ago in 1928, I was still a young man in my twenties. I often went to the mountains and the wilderness and shouted to the Lord that I would consecrate everything to Him. In 1933 the Lord came to me and actually touched me to consecrate myself for His work. I struggled and reasoned with the Lord, but He only answered me with His presence. On the day I agreed to give up my job, many tears poured out from my being. I knelt before the Lord and told Him that I was willing to drop everything and to give it all up to Him. The Lord's name became very sweet and rich to my mouth. Inwardly I was filled with joy. I felt that nothing could stop me from giving my all to the Lord. The sense of joy, release, and relief at that time was heavenly. I cannot describe that feeling even today. In short, I felt happy and right when I did it. I had never heard a message about handing over everything and forsaking all to follow the Lord, but when I obeyed the inward demand, I forsook everything spontaneously. In the same way, if we are living the life of Christ, the very mention of "handing over" will "bankrupt" us. Yet we will feel inwardly relieved, because we have answered such an inward call.</p><h2 class="head2">Being an Inwardly Happy Christian</h2><p>Let me ask you another question: "Why do you want to be a Christian?" (Brother Ma answers, "If I were not a Christian, I would not be happy.") But my answer is that I am a Christian because I want to be inwardly happy. If I become a Christian merely because I want to go to heaven or to be forgiven of my sins, I cannot be a thoroughly happy Christian. In order to be a happy Christian, we have to be resolute and absolute. Unless we forsake everything to follow the Lord, we will not feel inwardly happy and elated. What an inward relief we have when we drop everything!</p><p>Madame Guyon was willing to forgo all her possessions and forsake everything to please the Lord who lived within her. Even her beauty was stripped away by the Lord. To man she was a pitiable sight, but within her was indescribable joy. Count Zinzendorf, George MÃ¼ller, and Saint Francis of Assisi all lived their lives this way. They were willing to drop everything to follow the Lord. As a result, they all satisfied the inward demand and achieved inward peace. The word forsake means to let go. This shows us how severe Christ's demand within us is.</p><p>May we all yield to the demand of the life within us. It is not enough for a Christian to merely keep biblical truths and ordinances, practice Christian virtues, or be zealous for the Lord. If we are zealous for the Lord yet not inwardly happy, or if we are ardent yet do not feel the sweetness, there is something wrong with us as Christians. It is wrong for a Christian to not feel sweet, happy, or relieved. If a Christian acts properly, morally, sinlessly, and humbly, yet does not taste any freshness, sweetness, and joy, his problem is not with sin but with the fact that he has not answered Christ's inward call. The power of preaching the gospel comes naturally from the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. But a greater power comes from answering Christ's call. A man who forsakes everything is powerful in the gospel. The amount we forsake determines the amount of power of the Spirit we possess. If a Christian is dull towards spiritual things, it is because he cannot get through in this matter. He is probably reluctant to let go of certain things or too fond of certain items. If a man is slow or dull in his spiritual feelings, he must have a problem with his forsaking. The more we mean business with the Lord in following Him, the more we will answer His demand within us.</p><p>A Christian may not appear to have any problems outwardly. However, if he does not shine inwardly, is slow to react, or is not happy, he must have some problems. A piano may look good from the outside, but if its strings are not properly calibrated, the sounds it produces will be out of tune. The only reason that a Christian is dull in his feelings is because he has not answered Christ's demand within. If we feel that we are bound, that our fellowship with the brothers and sisters is blocked, and that the supply of the brothers and sisters produces little effect in us, we do not have to think of things we have to do for the Lord. All we need to do is ask what things we have to drop. Once we drop them, we will meet the Lord's demand. The things that we cannot drop are the very things that bear down on us. If a Christian feels dark, stifled, sour, or dull, it is because he has not answered Christ's call within.</p><p>We should not think that all of Christ's sayings in the Gospels were outward demands. They are actually His speaking and demands within us. All the requirements of Matthew 5&mdash;7 are Christ's demands within us. I do not believe a man can come to the Lord without touching His demands. All of the words spoken by Christ in the Gospels are His demands within us. If we answer His first demand, that is not enough. He will give us more demands. Like the young man who told the Lord that he had kept all the commandments, the Lord will always answer by saying, "Still you lack one thing" (Luke 18:22).</p>
