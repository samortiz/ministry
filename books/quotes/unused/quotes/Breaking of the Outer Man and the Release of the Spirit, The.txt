The only work God approves is that of the spirit, and the breaking of the outer man is the only way that the spirit can have full freedom
All of these messages were given by Watchman Nee during his training in Kuling for his co-workers in 1948 and 1949
He discovers that his outer man cannot be subject to the rule of the spirit and cannot walk according to God's highest demands
He discovers that the greatest hindrance to his work is his outer man and that this outer man frustrates him from exercising his spirit
In 2 Corinthians 4:16 Paul also said, 'Though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day'
In John 1224 the Lord Jesus said Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies it abides alone but if it dies it bears much fruit
It is the action of the temperature and moisture of the earth upon the grain which results in the breaking of the shell
The very next verse says He who loves his soullife loses it and he who hates his soullife in this world shall keep it unto eternal life
According to the Lord the outer shell is our own life, and the inner life is the eternal life that He dispenses
If the outer man is not broken, we can never become a blessing to the church, nor can we expect the world to receive God's grace through us!
The Holy Spirit has only one goal in all of His disciplining work To break and dismantle the outer man so that the inner man can break forth
The trouble with us is that we murmur as soon as we suffer a little hardship, and we complain as soon as we suffer a little defeat
From the day we were saved, the Lord has been working on us in many different ways for the purpose of breaking the self
The Lord works in us in so many different ways for the purpose of breaking the earthen vessel, the alabaster flask, the outer shell
It is unfortunate that many people do not know what the Lord is doing in them or what the Lord intends for them
When the Lord opens our eyes, we will see that everything that has happened to us throughout our lives is meaningful
After we realize that the Lord's goal is to break our outer man, we will realize that everything that has happened to us is significant
The trouble with many is that before the Lord is able to move even a finger, they show signs of displeasure already
One day, they suddenly receive one great blow from the Lord; the cumulative work comes first and the sudden work follows
When others meet him, they realize that they are touching his spirit, not his strong will, good mind, or reserved and deep emotions
She is quick in thoughts, quick in words, quick to confess, quick to write, and quick to throw away what she has written
We have to remember that all misunderstandings, complaints, and dissatisfactions arise from only one thing secret self-love
May we see that all of the dealings that we have received from the Lord during the past ten or twenty years are for achieving this one goal
Unless the outer man is broken, everything we have is in the mind and in the realm of knowledge and is useless
If we do not settle it the first day we believe in the Lord, we will have to settle it sooner or later, even if it is ten years later
Since the Spirit alone gives life, it is only as the spirit is released that sinners are regenerated and believers are built up
In many places in the Bible it is impossible to say whether the spirit being spoken of refers to the human spirit or God's Spirit
When the English versions come to the word pneuma, some use an upper-case Spirit, and others use a lower-case spirit
The Holy Spirit resides in our spirit, but it is difficult to tell which is the Holy Spirit and which is our spirit
Either their spirit does not move and the outer man acts alone, or their spirit moves but the outer man blocks its passage
The breaking of the outer man is the first lesson confronting everyone who desires to enter the service of the Lord
When his inner man needs to be released, the outer man affords a channel; the spirit can break out of the outer man to reach others
Nor will we experience the embarrassment of the inner man trying to weep while the outer man is unable to shed any tears
We will not complain of having things to say inwardly yet going around in circles and not being able to say them outwardly
Poverty of thoughts will not occur, and we will not need to use twenty words to utter what can be said in two words
The free release of the spirit is not only necessary to our work; it is profitable to our personal walk as well
If the spirit is released, we spontaneously will have power in our testimony when we deliver God's word with our spirit
We will also experience this in our preaching of God's word, that is, in ministering God's word to others as a minister of the word
We will know the kind of person he is, the kind of attitude he has, the kind of Christian life he lives, and the kind of needs he has
If our spirit is free and released, it will be easy for others to touch our spirit; our spirit will become very touchable
They are Christians, and we are Christians, but after we sit down and talk for two or three hours, we still cannot touch them
Even though they felt His presence when they turned back to God, they would lose it as soon as they turned away
The problem of maintaining God's presence with human memory is a great frustration to many Christians, not just to these brothers
To them, the 'presence' of God can only be maintained when their memory is fresh; when their memory fails, the 'presence' is gone
If we try to retain God's presence in our mind, this presence is lost as soon as we are not in complete control of our mind
The function of the mind and the function of the emotion are both activities, and no activity can go on forever
Two substances will blend together only when they are of the same nature, such as water with water or air with air
A man loses God's presence and the enjoyment of it because his outer man is constantly responding to outside activity
If God is merciful to us, He will break our outer man, and our inner man will no longer be touched when many things happen to us
They think that the farther away they are from people and activities, the closer they will be to God's presence
Once the Lord breaks our outer man, our inner being will not respond to such things; we will have a deaf ear to these noises
When the 'plates' clamor, we can hide ourselves in God's presence as much as when we are praying by ourselves alone
Many brothers and sisters feel that they have to drop the things they have in their hands before they can pray
We feel that we have somehow drifted from God in talking to others and that by praying we can come back to Him once more
We will feel as much of God's presence in talking to others as when we are kneeling down and praying with them
Putting this a different way, we will not have the feeling that we are turning back to God when we pray after rebuking a brother severely
When the outer man is broken, all outward activities are confined to the outward realm while the inner man continues to enjoy God's presence
Strictly speaking, the outward things can only affect the outer man; but the outer man, in turn, affects the inner man
When the outer man is separated from the inner man, all distractions are confined to the outer realm; they cannot enter the inner realm
The outer man can be conscious of the 'shuffling of the plates,' while the inner man continues to live before God
They can take care of outward things with their outer man, while at the same time continue to abide in God and in His presence
The outer man will only mind the outward things, and the outward things will stop with the outer man; they will not get to the inner man
They are like Brother Lawrence, who was busy with outward affairs, yet who had another person within him who lived before God
The other work is the separating of our spirit from our soul or the dividing of our inner man from our outer man
We always have things in our hands prior to God's speaking, and we always have many things in our hands before the outer man is broken
He only has so much strength, and when he has exhausted his strength, he has no more strength to spend on other things
If a man spends more time in one thing, that is, if his mind is set fully on one thing, he will have no strength to think about other things
The Bible also shows us that the righteousness of the law is fulfilled in those who walk according to the spirit
Suppose a mother leaves the house and entrusts her young child to a friend, saying, 'Please take care of her for me'
If we waste our mental strength on the things of the flesh, we will not have enough mental energy to take care of the things of the spirit
If we set our mind on the things of the flesh, we will have no further strength to set our mind on the things of the spirit
If he has used up all of his emotions within the last two days, he will be unable to feel or say anything for another two days
Even the strongest person finds himself with a wavering will when it comes to making a decision before the Lord
The Holy Spirit never works on man apart from man, and our spirit can never work on man apart from our outer man
Whenever our outer man is occupied by 'things in the hands' and has exhausted its strength, we cannot participate in God's work
Once the outer man has things in its hands, the inner man has no way to break out, and God's work is frustrated
If the outer man is not broken, we are still doing our own things, taking our own way, and loving our own preferences
God must first break our outer man before He can use our 'broken' love to love the brothers and before our love can be expanded
When our inner man needs the will it cannot find it because our will has been moving too independently and has too many things in its hands
We do not despise the burden but even if our entire spirit is full of burden this burden is useless and bound up if our mind is not fruitful
The trouble today is that while our inner man is available to receive a burden from God, the mind in our outer man is too busy and confused
It does mean that the 'things in the hands,' that is, in the will, have to be stripped so that the will no longer acts independently
We have to ask God for mercy so that the outer man will be broken and the inner man will have a way to come out
An unsaved person is also a 'unified' man, but the roles of his two men are reversed: His inner man is controlled by his outer man
In riding a bicycle a person can be in one of two conditions: Either the wheels work on the road or the road works on the wheels
When our inner man is strong and the outer man is broken, the wheels work on the road; that is, we decide when and how fast we want to move
If the outer man is stubborn and unbroken, it is like riding a bicycle downhill; the slope works on the wheels
Whether or not a man is useful before the Lord depends on whether his spirit can be released through his outer man
By the Lord's grace, when He levels the slopes and breaks the outer man, the outer man no longer offers suggestions and makes decisions
Although we are not very clear about this work ourselves, nevertheless, God has been carrying on the breaking day by day
If we do not see God's operation through the working together of all these environments, we have to pray, 'God!
They wish they can hear more doctrines, pick up more ideas for preaching, and understand more expositions of the Bible
In dealing with us and in breaking us for the release and exercise of the spirit God works according to His law not according to our prayer
A minute of revelation of God's way is better than an incessant, ignorant pleading for God's blessings and His help in our works
We have to know what he is saying with his mouth and what he is really saying in his heart, and what is the difference between the two
We have to know his outstanding characteristics, whether he is stubborn or humble, and whether his humility is real or artificial
If the Spirit of God shows our spirit the condition of those who come to us, we will be able to give them a suitable word
If we place a soul in the hand of a brother who has no discernment of men, he will not know how to deal with him
They do not know the problem, they do not know the complexity of men, and they have never learned to know the spiritual condition of others
No matter how sharp our mind is, we cannot bring the hidden things in man to light, nor can we touch the depth of man's condition
When a worker contacts a man, the first and most basic thing for him to do is to learn what this person's real need is before God
Only those who have studied medicine, that is, those who are trained in discerning spiritual problems, can tell them what they need
A subjective person will insist that others are sick with what he imagines the illness is; he will impose an illness upon others
We should not think that we can take every kind of spiritual work upon ourselves; we cannot monopolize everything
It is unfortunate that the spiritual well-being of many people is ruined in the hands of inexperienced brothers
The worker is the patient; he must be healed of the sickness before he can heal others who have the same sickness
When we try to identify others' spiritual problems, we are facing an issue far more serious than identifying physical illnesses
In order to know the condition of a patient, we have to consider this matter from two sides: From the side of the patient and from our side
The kind of person a man is dictates the kind of expression he displays and the kind of impression he gives to others
When we say that a spirit is stubborn, we mean that the inner man of that person has assumed the characteristics of the stubborn outer man
When we say that a spirit is proud, we mean that the inner man of that person has been covered with the proud outer man
When we say that a spirit is jealous, we mean that the inner man of that person has been shrouded with the jealousy of the outer man
The spirit can be proud or stubborn because the condition of the outer man is mixed up with the spirit when the outer man is not broken
When the spirit is released, the condition of the outer man tags on to the spirit and is released together with the spirit
In order to have a clean spirit, a man does not have to deal with his spirit; he only needs to deal with his outer man
If we know how to touch others' spirit, we will know a brother's need because the secret to knowing man is to touch his spirit
A brother may be very strong and conspicuous in a certain point, which strikes our attention as soon as we come into contact with him
Once we touch his spirit, we know his condition, and we know the things he is trying to show as well as the things he is trying to hide
If we try to protect or excuse ourselves in a certain matter, we will lose our spiritual sense and supply in that matter
A man can learn the lessons of ten years in one year, or he can drag out the lessons of one year for twenty or thirty years
The more we experience the discipline of the Holy Spirit, the more we will be able to touch others with our spirit
Once the Lord gives us a severe blow in a certain matter, we immediately will be alerted when the same seed sprouts in other brothers
When he opens his mouth to condemn pride again, the teaching may be the same, but a basic difference will be evident
When a man is speaking, we have to pay attention not only to the things he is saying but to the condition of his spirit
If we truly know the meaning of God's work, we will have to acknowledge that the outer man is indeed a great hindrance
The fundamental teaching of the Gospels is that God was in a man while the fundamental teaching of the Epistles is that God is in the church
When the Almighty God dwelt in Christ, He was still the Almighty One; He was not limited or diminished in any way
If our outer man is broken by God's grace, there is no limit to how God will employ us as channels to His work
One undeniable fact in studying God's Word is that the kind of person we are determines the kind of Bible we have in our hands
If we hear a prophet speaking today, we have to realize that his speaking contains not only words and thoughts but something else
The basic and most crucial requirement of all in reading the Bible is to be able to release one's spirit to touch the spirit of the Bible
Suppose a naughty boy breaks a window of a neighbor's house and the owner of the house runs out to scold the child
They want to discharge the burden and the message that is within them, but their outer man cannot provide them with any utterance
When we have a burden or a word within, our outer man will come up with a suitable word to fitly express our inner thoughts
The inner man will come up with the right thoughts and proper words to flow out only as the outer man is broken and smashed
If the shell remains, the burden in the spirit will remain, and God's life and power will not flow to the church
He will have the word within him, but he will not be able to speak it out because his outer man is blocking the way
Those who base their acceptance of the Lord on emotional impulses will not last, nor will those who are convinced by persuasion in the mind
If the very sight of an unsaved person compels us to do something to save him, it means that our spirit is released
We always have to pay attention to the matter of the breaking of the outer man because all of our problems lie in the outer man
If our spirit is discharged in a strong way, they will have no choice but to prostrate themselves before the Lord
He does not want to see him wait for many years before he consecrates himself to the Lord or answers the Lord's call to follow Him
As soon as a man is saved, he should be delivered from sin and should consecrate himself absolutely to the Lord
If the gospel is indeed to be recovered, the preachers of the gospel must allow the Lord to cut a free way through them
We believe that as the Lord takes the way of recovery, the gospel of grace will become one with the gospel of the kingdom
Later, it seems as though those who heard the gospel of grace did not have a chance to hear the gospel of the kingdom
Just as Christ was God's manifestation rather than His limitation, the church should be His manifestation rather than His limitation
He will continue this work in the church until the church no longer is a limitation to Him but a manifestation of Him instead
It is only an expression of our intention to willingly give ourselves unconditionally, unreservedly, and unequivocally to God
The discipline of the Holy Spirit must be added to our consecration before we can become a useful vessel to the Lord
He finds out what is tenacious in us and what is beyond the control of the inner man, and He deals with us according to what He knows
The nature of the outer man corresponds to the nature of outward things; the outer man is easily affected by the outward things
He knows that a certain thing will break our outer man, and He orders it to come upon us once, twice, and again and again
After a man is saved and before he is consecrated, he still loves himself dearly and has little love for the Lord
One cannot say that the Holy Spirit is not disciplining him; He does order things to bring him to God and to break his outer man
After a man is enlightened by God and has consecrated himself to God, the Holy Spirit will have the liberty to do His work
The only reason for such things to come upon us is that we have committed ourselves unconditionally to the Lord
Because we consecrated ourselves in this way, the Holy Spirit is free to do His work in us without concern for resistance on our part
Either we do not take the Lord's way at all, or if we do, we have to pay the utmost attention to the disciplining work of the Holy Spirit
Listening to a message can also be a means of receiving grace because we can go to God and receive grace through listening
From the day we became a Christian, our daily life has been one in which we receive one means of grace after another
Our meetings, our listening to messages, our prayer, and many other things we do are means by which we obtain grace
When we look back and examine our experience of the various means of grace, we will get an idea of how much we have gone on with God
The discipline of the Holy Spirit is too crucial; it is a Christian's main means of receiving grace throughout his life
If we have not learned the proper lessons in the discipline of the Holy Spirit, we cannot be proper Christians and can never serve God
If our outer man remains strong, others will encounter mixture when they encounter us; they will realize that we are not that pure
On the one hand, they will see that we do love the Lord; on the other hand, they also will know that we love ourselves
On the one hand, they can say that here is a precious brother; on the other hand, they have to say that here is a stubborn brother
The basic issue is whether or not we can give ourselves to God unconditionally unreservedly and unequivocally for Him to deal with us freely
We think that we are clever, that we know everything, and that we can think of things that others cannot think of
Because of this, the Lord allows us to make mistakes and stumble again and again so that we would be wary of our own thoughts
We make other judgments, and they turn out to be wrong again, so terribly wrong that we cannot even salvage the loss
The Holy Spirit is arranging things every day and providing us with plenty of opportunities to learn our lessons
It is not available just to those who are educated, clever, and gifted but to those who are uneducated, dull, and short of gifts as well
Prayer cannot replace the discipline of the Holy Spirit, nor can the ministry of the word, the study of the Scriptures, or meditation
As we are smitten once, twice, many times, there will come a time when spontaneously we will become sober; we will no longer be arrogant
Now the outer man prostrates in fear and trembling; it has yielded itself to God and is no longer at odds with the inner man
When we look back at all that has happened in the past, we have to acknowledge that everything the Lord has done is meaningful
Let us put ourselves in His hand unreservedly and unconditionally, praying that this breaking work will be accomplished in us
If a man has never experienced any dealing in his outer man, it is impossible to expect the power that issues from him to be pure
The preachers themselves may not feel anything, but the pure ones immediately will sense the presence of mixture
We often are doing God's will outwardly, but actually it is only a coincidence that God's will matches our will
After our outer man is battered once, ten, twenty times, we will be broken and our hard outer shell before God will be gone
One comes through the discipline of the Holy Spirit, and the other is the result of the revelation of the Holy Spirit
Many people who are not even spiritual in their own room expect to be spiritual when they stand on the platform
No matter how hard a person tries to pretend, act, or cover up himself, his spirit comes out as soon as he opens his mouth
Whatever kind of spirit we have and whatever mixture there is in our spirit will be obvious to everyone as soon as we open our mouth
If God intends for us to serve Him in the ministry of the word and if we have to speak for God, we have to ask for grace
If we have not experienced this deliverance, we will express our outer man subconsciously every time we open our mouth
It is possible for the discipline of the Spirit to come before the revelation of the Spirit, and it is possible for the order to be reversed
We can make a distinction in sequence, but when the Holy Spirit works, He does not necessarily do one thing first and then the other
Living refers to its nature, and operative refers to the works which it accomplishes in man according to God's will
In the first part of the verse it says, 'Piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow'
When God grants us mercy and enlightens us, He will speak to us in a serious and sober way, as if to say, 'This is it!
The other man hears the same thing, but God's light is upon him, and he falls on his face and says, 'My goodness, this is me!
When God's light shines on us, we will see what the outer man is, and we will fall down and not be able to rise again
When God's light shines on us, we will find that very little of what we have said were words given by the Lord
We will realize how much of what we have is of ourselves, of the soul, and how much is of the Lord and of the spirit
As soon as the light shines, the soul is divided from the spirit, and there is the discerning of the thoughts and intentions of the heart
As soon as God's light shines on us, we will realize that even our rejection of the flesh is an act of the flesh
We will see the real condition of the thoughts and intentions of our hearts, and we will bow down and say, 'Lord!
When this word comes to us, the soul and the spirit are divided, even as a two-edged sword divides the joints and the marrow
Brothers and sisters, when the self is exposed and made manifest by the light, we will fall on our faces before God
Revelation is God opening our eyes to see our intentions and the deepest thoughts in our being as God sees them
Just as we are naked and laid bare before Him, we are naked and laid bare before ourselves after we receive revelation
How do we know what is spiritual and what is soulish, what is from the inner man and what is from the outer man?
As soon as God exposes our thoughts and shows us the intentions of our heart, our soul will be separated from our spirit
Whenever we are able to discern the thoughts and intentions of our heart, we are able to divide our soul from our spirit
When the inner man and the outer man are distinguished from one another, then our soul and spirit will be divided
Once we are placed under this great light, we will discover how little of what we have done in our lifetime has been of the Lord
We have been the ones who have been acting busily and zealously working speaking helping the brothers and sisters and preaching the gospel
Everything will be clear, and we will realize that the self actually involves so much, including activities so numerous
Anything that has passed through the judgment of light once will be judged again as soon as a little seed sprouts forth
Sometimes we say that we have a good impression of a certain person, or that we have a bad impression of another person
The Bible says that 'one day Elisha was passing through Shunem; and there was a wealthy woman there, who compelled him to have a meal
Every time we contact others, we may give them an unpleasant feeling that we are self-loving, stubborn, and proud
If the outer man is not broken our spirit will not be released and the impression we give to others will not be an impression of the spirit
A brother once was speaking on the subject of the Holy Spirit but all his words attitude and stories exposed him as a man full of the self
We will only be able to give others spiritual teachings; we will not be able to give others spiritual impressions
What the Holy Spirit accomplishes in us through His disciplining work is different from what we receive through ordinary preaching
It is characterized by the fact that the instant we see the truth, we receive the content of that truth itself
After a man passes through the Spirit's discipline, he will be edified as well as see the truth; he will be built up as well as torn down
The pride that we see under the light of revelation is completely different from the pride that we speak of with our mouth
The self that we see today is thousands of times more evil and filthy than the self that we spoke of in the past
When we see our shortcomings under the shining, the shortcomings are finished immediately; they are killed immediately
Paul did not receive a shining and then hasten to kneel beside the road; the very instant he was enlightened, he fell down
Once we have seen our true condition under God's light and once we have seen what our pride is, the impression will never leave us
When God exposes all of the thoughts and intentions of the heart to us, we become naked not only before Him, but before ourselves as well
When we see ourselves under God's light, we are so ashamed that no place is good enough for us to hide ourselves
We cannot find more fitting terms before the Lord to describe ourselves; we can only say that we are filthy and evil
Only this kind of shining will remove our pride, and only this light will stop our fleshly activities and break our outer shell
We have these two main things before us the Spirit's discipline and God's shining, or we can say the Spirit's revelation
Under this light he sees that he is finished, that he is absolutely useless, and that all of his former boasts are now his shame
Rather, it means that the Holy Spirit has been disciplining for years without producing anything or arriving at any result
Our attitude before the Lord should be as the psalmist said, 'I did not open my mouth; for You have done this'
We have to remember that it is not our brother, sister, friends and relatives, or any other person who is dealing with us
With some people, the Holy Spirit may order yet another kind of discipline; He may use the environment to shatter their subjectivity
The supporting elements which prop up our inner structure may be different, but the inner structure is the same
The more God carries out the breaking work in us and the wider the scope of this breaking becomes, the quicker we will be mellowed
When we contact certain brothers, we can say that they are gifted, but we have the feeling that they are not yet broken
In whatever area a man experiences Gods chastisement he will be purged from boasting pride carelessness and lawlessness in that same area
Because his outer man is broken it is easy for his spirit to be released and it is easy for him to touch the brothers and sisters spirits
Some brothers and sisters often offer such tiresome prayers in the meetings that others wish they would stop, yet they keep on going
The spirits of the others speak out and plead for them to stop, but they do not have any feeling in themselves
If a man is broken, it is easy for his spirit to touch the spirits of others, and it is easy for him to feel what others feel
His spirit will be open, and the church will easily touch his spirit and communicate its feelings to his spirit
The Body of Christ does not arrive at a consensus through discussion and debates, just as there is no need for discussion in our own bodies
As our outer man is broken, it will be easy for us to be adjusted, and it will be easy for us to have the feeling of the Body
He has a shell in his mentality, and he can only receive help in the mental realm; he cannot receive any spiritual edification
If the Lord steps into his situation and works on him repeatedly for one, two, or a few years, the shell of his mentality will be broken
The more dealings a mans spirit receives from God the more thorough will be the breaking of the outer man and the more help he will receive
He will no longer pay attention to the nicety of the sermon, the eloquence of the speech, or the soundness of the interpretation
Men often pass by us, but we cannot touch their spirit and cannot receive any edification from them because our shell is too thick
The meaning of edification is nothing less than our spirit being touched by others' spirits or by the Holy Spirit
If we want to help them, we have to exert much energy to pray and work on them before they will allow us to do anything
If we happen to hear the same brother preaching on the same message the next Sunday, we will be bored and will want to leave
If a brother preaches the first time with the release of his spirit he will touch and change our entire being we will be washed and revived
The subject may be old and the doctrines may be the same, but we will receive a cleansing and washing every time his spirit is released
The best that can be said of doctrines and teachings that are not vitally linked with the spirit is that they are dead
After our outer man is broken, it will become easy for us to receive edification; in fact, we will receive much edification
We truly will be able to say that God's riches have now become the riches of the Body, and the riches of the Body have now become our riches
The more help a person can receive and the broader the scope of supply he draws, the more we can say that he is a broken man
If the Lord grants them mercy and deals with them in strong and multifarious ways, they will receive supply from the whole church
If we have a hard shell around us, we will not sense the spirit even when the Holy Spirit is released through other brothers
Even though the move may be very small, what matters is not whether the move is big or small but whether or not we have touched the spirit
May we all realize that the breaking of the outer man has a great deal to do with receiving help and edification from God
Fellowship is not a communication of the mind with the mind or an exchange of opinions; it is the contact of spirit with spirit
It is only as we receive mercy from the Lord to break the outer shell and to tear down the outer man that our spirit is released
Only then will we touch the spirits of the brothers and sisters, and only then will we understand the meaning of fellowship with the saints
From that point forward we will understand what the Bible means when it speaks of the fellowship of the spirit
Our spirit will be open to receive the spirits of all the brothers; it will touch and be touched by the spirits of all the brothers
If our outer man is broken and our inner man released, we will touch the spirit of the church, and we will be more useful to the Lord
When we hand ourselves over to His mighty hand, we will see that this work should have started five or ten years ago
If we know that an activity is of the flesh, should we try to stop it ourselves, or should we wait for the Holy Spirit to break it?
As we give ourselves to imitations and artificiality, we will gradually be led to believe that we are what we pretend to be
It is better to be a little bit more natural in the way we conduct ourselves and allow God to build up something in us instead
We should not engage in any outward imitating or copying; rather, we should look to the Lord to daily add the virtues that we need
Natural meekness sometimes is a hindrance to the spirit, and anything that hinders the spirit is stubborn in nature
If the Lord wants him to stand up to say a few severe words, his natural meekness will become a hindrance to him
When he is asked to do what he does not want to do, or when something challenges his reluctance, he is meek no longer
As soon as he comes across something that he is reluctant to do, his humility is gone and his meekness is gone; everything he has is gone
A few people are not strong in the inner man in spite of the fact that their outer man has been broken already
