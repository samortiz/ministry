   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Net</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What about the remainder of the Gentile world?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the Lord Jesus comes back many of them still will not be Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord knows how to take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He will send His angels to gather them all to Him and He will exercise judgment over them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the significance of the parable of the net and this will complete the Lord's dealing with the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After this judgment, God will be able to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>FROM A SEED TO A PEARL</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These parables of the mysteries of the kingdom show us that the Lord Jesus came as a Sower to sow the seed and that eventually He gained a pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The pearl comes out of the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ is the seed, and the church is the pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No wonder the Lord Jesus sold all that He had to buy the pearl!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should not think that we are the seller or the buyer.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are poor and cannot pay; neither do we have anything to sell.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The pearl is too precious and the price is too great.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord Jesus paid the price, selling all that He had to buy the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Acts 20:28 reveals that the Lord Jesus purchased the church with His own blood.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He bought the church by paying such high price.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord Jesus sowed Himself as the seed, and eventually He will receive a pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What a joy this will be to the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>GROWTH AND TRANSFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we examine Matthew 13, we will notice two things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>First is growth; the seed needs to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As we pointed out previously, Paul planted, Apollos watered, and God made to grow 1 Cor 3:6, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>. The second thing is transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The pearl is not an item of God's original creation; it is a transformed piece of sand.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In itself the sand is not precious, but it is covered and transformed by the secretion of a precious element.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Transformation is not self-correction or a mere outward change.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is a metabolic change which results from a new element being added into us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At one time, we were all little rocks.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then the resurrection life of Christ was added to us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Again and again the resurrection element was secreted over us, producing a change in life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this one chapter of Matthew, we see both growth and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to experience growth and transformation day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the next chapter we will see that growth and transformation are always accompanied by the building.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Eventually, there are not many pearls, but one great pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This signifies one entity comprised of many who have been built together into oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the building.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, we have growth, transformation, and building.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>With the seed, the wheat, and the meal there is the possibility for the evil one to damage by bringing in something negative and corrupting.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But with the pearl and the treasure, Satan can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the parables of the treasure and pearl, Satan is not mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whenever there is transformation in a church, Satan is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Satan can do nothing against the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At that time, he will be in the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The principle is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If the church is transformed, Satan will be jobless.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If our growth remains at the stage of the seed, the wheat, or the meal, Satan will have many opportunities to damage and frustrate.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, when we are transformed, Satan will be finished.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He will be unable to inject any more leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need growth, and even more, we need transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are not only wheat and meal; eventually we become the pearls.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>First, we are the vegetables; by growth and transformation we become the minerals.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>According to the revelation of the Bible, the precious stones and pearls are for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The building comes from growth and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For the building, the vegetable life is insufficient we need the minerals.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need the treasure and the pearl.</S>
