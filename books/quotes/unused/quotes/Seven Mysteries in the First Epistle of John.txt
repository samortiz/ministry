Nonetheless, we know that we have life; describing it may be difficult, but in our experience we know what it is
The Lord Jesus laid down His psuche life to accomplish redemption for us and thus to make the eternal zoe life available to us
Jesus as a human being died on the cross, laying down His human psychological life in our stead, in order to impart to us the zoe life
We may wonder how we managed to arrive, along with so many others whose love for the Lord seemed so much stronger than ours
If you check your electrical meter when your appliances are operating, you will see that the current moves when you use the electricity
If we go on in the fellowship back to its source, we shall see that there is not only truth or realization, but light as well
In Romans 6, for instance, we read that our old man has been crucified with Christ that we might be freed from sin
If we are in the fellowship and allow that fellowship to bring us into God, there in the source God as light shines over us
When Paul besought the Lord to take away the thorn in his flesh, the Lord told him, 'My grace is sufficient for thee'
Upon the overlaid gold were golden rings, through which went the golden uniting bars to link all the boards together
The wooden boards signified humanity and the gold overlay, divinity, not only in its nature but also in its glory
All these activities are quite commonplace, yet none of them is necessarily what the holy Word means by the term fellowship
All the hundreds of members in the body are kept in fellowship or oneness with each other by this same circulation
When the blood flows in the blood vessels, there is circulation; when the blood is stationary, there is no circulation
Electric current is another illustration of this flowing of the divine life, which the Bible calls the fellowship
Now this fellowship brings us into the source of grace and truth, so that we are no longer just superficially experiencing them
In 2 Corinthians 13:14 he wrote of 'the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit'
If we are brought into the fellowship, that is, into God, we shall find the source of grace, love, which is far sweeter and more intimate
At first we may consider that this is their love for us, but actually their doing is only the expression of their love
If we appreciate only their outward doing, without recognizing the love behind it, we are being too superficial toward them
When we realize the love which motivates their doing, our appreciation will be for themselves alone rather than for their kind deeds
The accompanying sense of sweet intimacy indicates that we are appreciating the source of their gracious doing, which is love
If we are brought deeper into the inner circulation of the divine life, this fellowship will bring us into God Himself, who is love
Of looking for presents, she is content to enjoy your love and satisfied in the assurance that you care for her
You may give her things because you love her, but she does not regard those things as highly as the love which prompted you to buy them
We no longer have much interest in whether we have this or that good thing; it is enough to have God Himself as love, the source of grace
Under the shining we may have the truth, or the realization, but we are not in the light until we are in God Himself
From the time we were saved, we have been under the shining, coming to certain realizations and understandings
Probably a good number of us have occasionally had experiences in which we were brought into God and recognized that we were in the light
For you the apology is sufficient; after all, a bad attitude is a common fault, not to be taken all that seriously
Your hands may look quite clean now, but if you see them in the light, you will see how full of germs they are
We have some amount of truth, knowing that we should do this and be like that, but such a realization is not light; it is only truth
To apply the blood means that we have the realization that we are sinful but have not yet had our sins exposed in the light
As our propitiation, He paid our debt, met our obligations, and at His own expense took care of whatever was outstanding against us
Eventually, of course, he is frustrated, for whenever the heart 'shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away'
He therefore justly forgives us because of Christ's propitiation and faithfully forgives us because of His own spoken word
We may mentally perceive that we are wrong or sinful, but until we are in the light that knowledge or conviction is at best superficial
In the light we shall have the deep deep realization that every part of our being is sinful and that even what we consider holy is still sin
In spite of our sinfulness, we will not be distracted from going on, because this Attorney fully takes care of our case
We do not stop to consider what a mystery it is that God, the Person Himself, can actually abide in us and we in Him
In Genesis we read of Abraham and Jacob, who eventually became intimate with God, yet there is no mention of their abiding in Him
If we continue through the Old Testament, we still cannot find a verse indicating that God and man can abide in each other
If we read on in this very chapter, however, verses 10 and 11 tell us clearly, 'I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me'
Christ Himself would accomplish the removal of such obstacles as sins, sin, the old nature, the self, Satan, and the world
The King James Version translates the word for abide five different ways: abide ; dwell ; being present ; continue ; remain
Now that we are in Christ, we must stay there; remain in Him; dwell in Him; settle down in Him; continue there
With the Gospel of John we have already been put into Christ; thus, what 1 John is emphasizing is our need to remain where we have been put
Over and over again, beginning with the Acts, the little word 'in' is used to describe our relationship with the Lord
In humanity He has passed through death and resurrection, bringing His redeemed and uplifted humanity with Him into resurrection
Many Christians stumble over this, because they have been taught to consider the Trinity as composed of three separate and distinct Persons
John's Gospel presents Christ first as the Word who became flesh, then as the Lamb of God who took away our sins
When we say that we abide in God and He abides in us, our concept of what 'God' means and what 'abiding' means may be somewhat vague
As the Apostle John was writing of these matters, however, he abruptly brought up another subject, which makes the application quite clear
For more than nineteen centuries the anointing has been the line of demarcation between these two kinds of Christians
To understand the anointing, we must comprehend the process the Triune God underwent in order to establish His relationship with us
During His earthly life He was like a seed without 'form nor comeliness,' with 'no beauty that we should desire him'
The Lord Jesus likened Himself to a grain of wheat, waiting to fall into the ground and die so that He could grow up into many grains
The essence of His incarnation and human living, the effectiveness of His death, and the resurrection itself are all now included in Him
He is called the almighty God the Lord Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit the lifegiving Spirit the Spirit of life and the Spirit of Jesus Christ
Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit,' 1 John 4:13 declares
The anointing ointment, then, includes the death of Christ, the effectiveness of His death, the resurrection, and the power of resurrection
Four, like the four fingers of our hand, signifies the creature; one, like the thumb, signifies the unique Creator
All these spices, in three units of five hundred, signify the Triune God, the Second of whom was split when He was crucified
All these four are mingled with one hin of oil, again giving us four plus one, or five, the number of responsibility
The numbers most used in the compounding of the anointing ointment are three and five, both of which relate to God's building
Its purpose is not for our individual spirituality but for the building and the priesthood, which are corporate
There is no need for you to reckon that they are killed; the killing power is in the antibiotics, not in your reckoning
Surely from your experience you can testify that the only way to be rescued from it is to contact the living Lord
If we thus keep directly contacting Him, we shall experience the anointing applying the divine ingredients to our being
Day by day you will be transformed, not by following outward regulations but by having these divine ingredients added to you
When we consider the ingredients of this compound, we have to worship the Lord for such an accurate, unveiling picture
Because He has transferred us out of Adam and into Himself, we now have the position to abide in Him and let Him abide in us
If we thus keep ourselves attached to Him, we shall all the time be participating in what He is and what He has accomplished for us
No book ever written is more consistent even though it is composed of sixtysix books which superficially are quite different from each other
In our dwelling place we have our food our clothing our loved ones and many little things that are special to us in short we have everything
Isaiah 661 tells us Thus saith the Lord The heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool where is the house that ye build unto me
They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures'
We are, occupying a very little space, yet God would take us as His dwelling place and would say to us, 'Man, come into Me and live in Me!
He had eaten it, and that was wrong, no doubt; but the source of his disobedience, Adam maintained, was firstly God and then his wife
The record continues, covering many years of history, until we come to Isaiah, where we have another reference to the seed of the woman
Isaiah further describes Him in 9:6, where he tells us that the child born is the mighty God and the son given is the everlasting Father
Some seven hundred years later, Mary, a virgin, conceived a child of the Holy Spirit, thus fulfilling these prophecies in Genesis and Isaiah
Olive oil, which is commonly recognized as being a type of the Holy Spirit, is not the only ingredient of the anointing ointment
Four, the number of spices, stands for the creature, while three, the number of times that five hundred occurs, speaks of the Trinity
It is the all-inclusive Spirit-the Spirit of life, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, His Spirit who indwells us, the Spirit Himself
All that this compound Spirit contains-divinity, the proper humanity, the death of Christ, and His resurrection-will be our portion
It is like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard even Aarons beard that went down to the skirts of his garments
The ointment running down from the head over the whole body right down to the skirts depicts the brethren dwelling together in unity
If you notice the context of the verses on the anointing in 1 John 2, you will see that such is the case here as well as in Psalm 133
The anointing in the church life made a distinction between those who were true believers and those who were of antichrist
Day by day, as we are in the church life, this compound ointment will be doing its work in us, until finally we are in resurrection
Whether a meeting is living or not so living, this inward working still continues, infusing and transforming us
In previous messages, we have already considered the mysteries of life, fellowship, abiding, and the anointing presented in this book
In chapter three the first verse is Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God
Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God'
Now look at 4:7: 'Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God'
Again the meaning here is not that if we love others we shall be born of God rather the evidence of our being born of God is that we love
When 1 John 3:9 tells us that the one born of God does not commit sin, it adds, 'for his seed remaineth in him'
Our regenerated spirit, then, is the key to understanding these verses regarding the characteristics of the one born of God
There is a teaching based on 1 John 39 which claims that once we are saved sin is eradicated that is it is no longer possible for us to sin
He opposed Brother Nee's teaching, based on Romans, that when we do not walk in the Spirit, we surely will sin
One day this brother, named Hwang, went with a few of his followers to a park, which required a ticket for admission
If sin has been eradicated, how could this Brother Hwang justify sneaking people into the park without paying?
His seed remaineth in him' 1 John 3:9 tells us, meaning that whoever is born of God has the seed of God abiding in him
From this portion of the Word we can see that the seed mentioned in 1 John must be the Lord Jesus Himself as the seed of life
To say this is the same as saying that the Lord Jesus is the seed of life, because He Himself is the Word of God
Long before we have finished praying, however, if we have truly prayed to Him from the depths of our being, we shall be regenerated
The outer ring corresponds to our physical body, the part of us that has substance and can be seen and touched
As it grows, it develops and spreads from the spirit into the soul, especially into the mind, the leading part of the soul
In verse 10 we are told, 'If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness'
The Spirit of life, then, comes into our spirit and enlivens it; the mind, in contrast, is only life when it is set on the spirit
If we set our mind, even our whole being, on the spirit, then the Spirit will have free course to spread into our mind, making it also life
You will come to realize that this seed is nothing less than the Person of the Triune God, the Triune God Himself
Put your full trust in this One who is greater than Satan, greater than your self, and greater than your flesh
In this Epistle the writer considers the believers in three categories : fathers, young men, and little children
The fathers are the older, experienced ones; the young men are the stronger ones; and the little children are the babes in Christ
We know from our experience that time and again we have to be brought back to life, back to what was there in the beginning
If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father'
As we care for that living seed, it will grow in us and spread life from our spirit into every other part of our inner being
If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death'
What others need is not instruction or correction or regulation, but an abundance of the riches of this life imparted to them
In the church life we are enjoying the spreading of this life from our spirit to our soul and eventually to our mortal body
Six of these we have already covered in the previous messages life fellowship abiding the anointing the divine birth and the divine seed
There are three that bear witness in earth, the spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one'
Concerning the blood, of course, it is generally agreed that this is the blood shed by the Lord Jesus on the cross
It is important for us to understand this, in order that we may apply its value; otherwise, we are lacking in something
Though he was the son of a priest, he was not brought up in the temple, nor did he wear the priestly garments, nor eat the priestly diet
For John to baptize them was to say that these repentant ones were good only to be buried, that they needed to be terminated
In this scene the water and the Spirit were both present to introduce this little Jesus as nothing less than the Son of God
They got permission for the soldiers to break the legs of the three who were being crucified in order to hasten their death
Of breaking His legs, one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear; from that wound there came out blood and water
Jesus, then, was manifested as the Son of God in an open way by the water of baptism, by the blood He shed on the cross, and by the Spirit
Whether we consider ourselves good or bad, of high caliber or worthless, God says all we are deserving of is burial
When Jesus died on the cross, His all-inclusive death terminated all the old creation, including the old man and the flesh
The Lord Jesus has come to us in water, terminating us; in the blood, redeeming us; and in the Spirit, germinating us
If we are still the way we were ten years ago, all of us will be on the same level as far as life is concerned
We need also those on another level-young men, strong enough to fight the enemy and guard the church against any attacks
We shall see in the church some lively and living new ones, some strong, vigilant young men, and some fathers rich in life
These victories in our family life, in our school life, and among the older ones are the outcome of the seven mysteries
Without being exhorted not to love the world, the church will nonetheless find that the world has no hold on it
There was a pastor of over twenty-five years' experience who was helped by the ministry and began to know life
Our fallen concept is that Satan will always bother us, that he is too much for us, and that we cannot overcome him
If in our prayer meetings we pitifully beg the Lord to deal with our enemy, we are short of life, short of these seven mysteries
The sixth issue of the mysteries is found in 2 John 9: 'Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God
The living Body cannot take the presence of corpses, anymore than we would be able to sleep in a room where there was a dead body!
The last issue is found in 3 John 910 I wrote unto the church but Diotrephes who loveth to have the preeminence among them receiveth us not
There will be the growth that brings in the distinctions in life between the little ones, the young ones, and the fathers
