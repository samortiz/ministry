   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE LORD HAVING BORNE ALL OUR SINS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To take care of this matter, we must first realize that the Lord Jesus has borne all our sins on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All the sins which we have committed, as well as those we are committing and will commit during our whole life, were borne by the Lord on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, on the day we believed in the Lord, under God s light we only saw the sins that we had committed before we had believed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A man can only be conscious of the sins which God shines His light upon; he cannot feel the sins which he has not yet committed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, the actual sins the Lord Jesus bore on the cross are more than the sins that we see.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord Jesus bore all of our sins on the cross, but we see only the sins which we have committed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You may have been saved at the age of sixteen, or you may have been saved at the age of thirty-two.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All the sins you committed before your salvation are absolutely and totally forgiven by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, at the time of your forgiveness, the number of sins that you were conscious of was actually much less than the actual number of sins which the Lord bore for you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Your experience of the Lord s grace went only so far as your personal experience of your sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the Lord s work on our behalf was based on His knowledge of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must realize that even the sins that we are not conscious of are included in the Lord Jesus redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Perhaps you were saved at the age of sixteen.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Suppose you had committed a thousand sins during the first sixteen years of your life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You might have said at the time you believed in the Lord, I thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>My sins have been forgiven because You have taken away all my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In saying that the Lord had taken your sins away, you meant that the Lord had dealt with your one thousand sins.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What would have happened if you had been saved at the age of thirty-two instead?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Proportionally, you probably would have committed two thousand sins by the age of thirty-two.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You might have said the same thing: O Lord, You have borne all my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you were saved at sixty-four years of age, you would have said the same thing: O Lord, You have borne all my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is quite clear then that the Lord has dealt with the sins that were committed during the first sixteen years of your life as well as the sins that were committed from age sixteen to age sixty-four.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord dealt with all of your sins on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The criminal on the cross did not believe in the Lord until just before he died, but the Lord took away all his sins Luke 23:39-43 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words, the Lord took away the sins of our whole life on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although, when we first believed in the Lord, we only felt the forgiveness of our past sins, in actuality, the Lord took away all our sins, even those we commit after we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must understand this fact before we can understand how to recover our fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE TYPE OF THE ASHES OF THE RED HEIFER</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have a picture of the Lord s vicarious death for our sins in the type of the ashes of the red heifer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Numbers 19 is a very special chapter in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A heifer was used, which speaks of something special.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This heifer was used not to meet a need at that moment but to meet a need in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This, too, is very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In verse 2 God told Moses and Aaron, Tell the sons of Israel to bring you a red heifer without blemish, in which there is no defect, and upon which a yoke has never come.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A heifer, not a bull, was offered here.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the Bible gender is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Male signifies everything related to the testimony of the truth, while female signifies everything related to the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is a principle we should be familiar with in reading our Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Abraham speaks of justification by faith, while Sarah speaks of obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Justification by faith is objective; it has to do with truth and testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Obedience is subjective; it has to do with life and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Throughout the Bible the church is symbolized by females, because the church is subjective, being related to the Lord s work in man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A heifer is used here instead of a bull because it represents another aspect of the Lord s work His work toward man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The red heifer signifies a work that is subjective rather than objective.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What happened to the heifer?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It was slaughtered, and its blood was taken and sprinkled seven times directly in front of the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In other words, the blood was offered to God because the work of the blood is always for God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The heifer s blood was sprinkled seven times in front of the tent of meeting, signifying that it was for God and for the redemption of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After the red heifer was killed, it was burned.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The skin, the flesh, the blood, and the dung were all burned.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The whole red heifer was burned.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As it was being burned, the priest cast cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet into the midst of the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What do cedar wood and hyssop signify?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>First Kings 4:33 said that Solomon discoursed about trees, from the cedar to the hyssop.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Cedar wood and hyssop therefore signify all the trees.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In other words, they signify the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What does scarlet signify?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This word is also translated scarlet in Isaiah 1:18, which says, Though your sins are like scarlet, / They will be as white as snow.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Scarlet, therefore, signifies our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>For the cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet to be burned together means that the sins of the whole world were gathered together with the red heifer when it was offered up to God; they were all burned together.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Here, we see a picture of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord Jesus offered Himself up to God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He embraced all our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The gross sins were there as well as the lesser sins.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The sins of the past, the present, and the future were also there.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The sins for which man feels the need of forgiveness, as well as the sins for which man does not feel the need of forgiveness, were there.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>All sins were upon the heifer, and they were all burned with it.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>After they were burned, what was done next?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Numbers 19:9 says, A man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and place them outside the camp in a clean place; and they shall be kept for the assembly of the sons of Israel for the water for impurity; it is a purification of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is what makes the red heifer so distinct.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>After the cedar wood, the hyssop, and the scarlet were burned with the heifer, the ashes were gathered up and kept in a clean place.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Thereafter, if any of the Israelites touched something unclean and became unclean before God, another clean person could mix the water for impurity with the ashes and sprinkle it on the unclean person.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This would remove the person s uncleanness.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In other words, the ashes were used to remove uncleanness.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They were prepared for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>They would be used when uncleanness was detected at a later time.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In the Old Testament, sinners needed to offer up sacrifices to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If a person had offered up a sacrifice and then touched something unclean, he would become unclean again before God and could no longer fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>What did he have to do?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Another person would take some ashes of the red heifer on this person s behalf, put them in a vessel, pour in living water, mix it into the water for impurity, and sprinkle it on his body.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The man s uncleanness would then be removed and his sin forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When an Israelite brought a bull or a lamb to the Lord and offered it up as a sin offering, he did it because of some known sin.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But the red heifer was related to another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The burning of the red heifer was not for known sins which had been committed in the past, but for future uncleanness.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The burning of the red heifer was not for past sins but for future transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This shows us another aspect of the Lord Jesus work.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>One aspect of the Lord s work is like that of the ashes of the red heifer.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The efficacy of redemption is signified by the ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The sins of the whole world are in it, and the blood is also in it.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Whenever a man becomes unclean or has touched some unclean things, he does not need to kill another red heifer and offer it to God.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>He only needs to take the ashes of the red heifer that was offered once and mix them with water and sprinkle them on the body.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>In other words, there is no need for the Lord to do anything a second time.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>His redemption accomplished everything.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>He made provision for all of our future uncleanness and future sins.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Everything has been fully accomplished by His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>What do the ashes signify?</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>In the Bible, ashes signify something in its final form.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Whether a bull or a lamb, its final form after being burned is ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Ashes are very stable; they do not corrupt into something else.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We cannot corrupt or destroy ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Ashes signify something in its final form.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The ashes of the red heifer signify the eternal and unchanging efficacy of the Lord s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The redemption which our Lord accomplished for us is most stable.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Do not think that rocks on mountains are stable.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Even rocks can be burned into ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Ashes are more stable than rocks.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>The ashes of the red heifer signify the Lord s redemption which He has prepared for us.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>It is forever unchanging and incorruptible.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We may apply it any time.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>If a Christian touches something unclean by accident and there is uncleanness in him, he does not have to ask the Lord to die for him again.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>He only needs to trust in the eternal and incorruptible efficacy of the ashes and to sprinkle his body with the water of life, and he will be clean.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>In other words, the ashes of the red heifer tell us that the past work of the cross is applicable for our use today.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>We also can say that the effectiveness of the cross covers all the needs we will ever have in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>These ashes are specifically for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Only one red heifer needs to be burned, and it only needs to be burned once.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Its ashes are enough to cover one s whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Thank the Lord that His redemption is sufficient for our whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>His death has taken away all our sins.</S>
