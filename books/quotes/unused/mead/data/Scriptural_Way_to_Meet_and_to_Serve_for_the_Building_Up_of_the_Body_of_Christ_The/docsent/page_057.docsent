   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>REGULARLY IN DAILY AFFAIRS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To speak the word of the Lord regularly in daily affairs is to apply certain verses from the Bible to your affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you are intending to go to a department store to spend some money, it is best to get a verse that fits that situation.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you are going to quarrel with a brother or with your wife, do not quarrel before getting a verse such as James 1:20 The wrath of man does not work the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Before you lose your temper, you have to bridle it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Your temper is like a wild horse, and when you apply a verse like James 1:20 to it, a bridle is there.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even if you are going to shine your shoes, do not do it before getting a verse.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When you shine your shoes, a verse like Ephesians 5:15 will help you Look therefore carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In doing anything in your daily affairs, it is best to get a verse first that fits your situation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If a sister is cooking fish, she can get some verses from John 21 where the Lord cooked fish for the disciples breakfast vv.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we would practice this, be assured that we will receive a great deal of help.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This kind of daily practice in every daily affair will accumulate the riches in us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We will be enriched.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A person who has the riches of God s word in his being can speak something rich, inspiring, and subduing in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His speaking will be like a sharp two-edged sword.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is not just a matter of reading the Bible and memorizing a verse.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are talking about the solid practice of speaking the word of the Lord regularly in daily affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Before doing anything, get a verse, apply that verse to your situation, and speak that verse to yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This surely is not vain speaking.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>TO PEOPLE AT ALL TIMES</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we become used to speaking, we will be able to speak the word of the Lord, ministering the gospel to sinners and ministering Christ to believers at all times.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must have the habit of speaking with the ability to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Habit brings in the ability.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we do not practice speaking and build up a habit of speaking, we will not have the ability to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have to speak the word of God, applying it to everything we do in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This kind of habit builds up an ability to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You will be not only eloquent but also very skillful in your expression and utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Sometimes you may want to preach the gospel to someone, but you may not know how to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You want to say something, but you do not have the ability or the skill.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, if you practice applying the word of the Lord to your daily life, avoiding profane, vain talk, and exercising to speak the word of the Lord regularly in daily affairs, it will be easy for you to speak the gospel to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You will have the boldness, the skill, and the ability to speak the gospel to any kind of unbeliever.</S>

   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Would you be able to speak to a high government official or to the president of a university?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You may be afraid to speak to such persons.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You may be able to speak to a freshman at the university but not to the chairman of an academic department.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But if you are apt to speak, you will have the ability to speak to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You will not care what the person s status is.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>No one is higher than the Lord of lords and the King of kings Rev 17:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The One who lives in you is the King of kings, and He is much higher than all the presidents, kings, and queens on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When you build up the skill of speaking, this skill will encourage you to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>LETTING THE WORD OF CHRIST DWELL IN US RICHLY</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Colossians 3:16 tells us that we need to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Greek word for dwell in this verse literally means to be in a house or to inhabit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need to let the word of Christ inhabit us, to make its home in us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When I buy a house and make it my home, all the rooms of the house will be under my management and direction.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>First, we move into a house, and then we get ourselves settled there.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We occupy every room of the house.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To let the word of Christ make its home in us is to let the word of Christ occupy us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our mind, emotion, and will are the rooms of our inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We need to let the word of Christ occupy these rooms.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Our strong will can be the safeguard of our being, our house.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Would we let the word of Christ get into the safeguard of our being?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We may be in the Lord for years without allowing the Lord to occupy our will.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we turn to the Lord in prayer, He may show us a part of our being that we have not opened to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Now the Lord Jesus is knocking at that door, wanting us to open ourselves up to the word of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He wants us to let the word of Christ occupy us, dwell in us, and take us over.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Colossians 3:15 tells us to let the peace of Christ arbitrate in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Christ Himself as peace must be the arbitrator in our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He must be enthroned as the ruler and decider of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>That means whatever He says that s it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>First, we let the peace of Christ arbitrate in our hearts, and then we let the word of Christ occupy us and take us over.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We must practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Then we will have the divine utterances in us to convey the riches of Christ in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Otherwise, we may be speaking Christ, and at a certain point our utterance will run out.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we are driving a car and the gasoline runs out, the car will stop.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Our utterance can run out in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We may have the intention and the desire to speak, but we have to stop our speaking because we do not have the storage of utterances.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We can always keep our utterance rich by letting the word of Christ make its home in us, occupy us, and take us over.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When we have the word stored up within our being, our utterance will not run out when we are speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Do we love the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Are we for the Lord s recovery in these last days?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If we love the Lord and mean business with the Lord for His recovery, we must be so faithful and honest to practice all these items.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Otherwise, I do not have much confidence that we will make it in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We all have to endeavor faithfully and honestly to practice day by day what the Lord has shown us.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If the church in your locality does not practice these things that much, do not blame anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Practice these things yourself, and your practice will be a help.</S>
