   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE THINGS TO GUARD AGAINST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Finally, there are a few things we should guard against.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In every age and every place, there are always things that damage God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today at least three things are before our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Being Welcomed by Political Authorities on Earth</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today the Chinese government welcomes Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This affords us all kinds of conveniences in our gospel work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We readily acknowledge God's hand in this.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, whenever any political authority on earth welcomes Christianity, the church on earth is challenged with greater temptation!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Pergamos failed in this area, and Thyatira also fell on account of this Rev 2:12-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Just as the Lord and His kingdom do not belong to this world, the church does not belong to this world John 18:36; 17:14, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church was chosen by the Lord out of the world 15:19 and sanctified from the world 17:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church is sanctified because it is separated from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whoever belongs to the church has received a heavenly calling Heb 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His commonwealth is not earthly, but heavenly Phil 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When a political authority rejects Christianity, such a problem may affect the move of the church, but this persecution is in accordance with the church's heavenly nature.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, if a political authority welcomes Christianity, it may make the move of the church easier, but the result is that she may lose her heavenly condition.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whenever any earthly political power embraces Christianity, the church loses her heavenly purity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whenever Christianity and earthly authorities hold hands, the church unites with the earth and commits fornication with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Political authority is altogether earthly, while the church is altogether heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church and state should be absolutely separated one from the other!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Roman Church with its many dark, corrupt, evil, and erroneous practices came about because Christianity was joined to earthly political authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the one hand, we should take advantage of the welcome from the government and use every convenient opportunity to spread the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the other hand, we should always be warned that earthly welcome can erode our heavenly position.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should always maintain our heavenly status with fear and trepidation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Foreign Money</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We thank the Lord for His grace among the Western brothers and sisters, who brought His gospel to China.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, we cannot deny the fact that wherever the gospel from the West goes, the power of money from the West also follows.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is of God that the gospel came, but it is a real problem when money comes along with it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is nothing wrong with money being given in the way of spiritual fellowship to meet the needs of the Chinese churches.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But it is absolutely wrong for money to become a kind of financial power!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The fact remains that much of the money from the West came as a kind of financial backing to Christianity in China.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Due to the changes in the Chinese government between 1926 and 1927 this change was certainly allowed by God , the power of so-called Western Christianity in China was reduced considerably.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But after China won the last war, a kind of trend crept in. International cooperation has resulted in the so-called Western powers moving into Chinese Christianity again.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should guard against this!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even if the money from the West is not an issue, one who is learning to serve God in purity should guard himself against it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Perhaps the money does not influence us, but it may become a crutch to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The only thing a servant of God should rely on is God, not foreign currency.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The source of his supply should be the heavens, not the West.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His eyes should be on the heavens, not on Westerners.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The money from the West may not become an influence, but it may cause one to lose his faith in God!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Chinese saints and the brothers and sisters from the West should have fellowship one with another in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They should confine their relationship strictly to this fellowship in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the relationship is normal, both spiritual supply and material supply will be mutual.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If this is not the case, the relationship is abnormal and should not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Imitation of Outward Ritual</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The New Testament service is spiritual rather than formal Rom 7:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is of life, not of letter Heb 7:16; 2 Cor 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although there are outward activities to our services and outward arrangements to our work, these activities and arrangements, in themselves, have no significance.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They are merely expressions of the inward reality of life, expressions which match an inward spiritual need.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If there is no reality of life inwardly and no spiritual need, any ritualistic activity or business arrangement has no bearing upon God's New Testament service.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is possible for a local church to have a certain outward expression that appears to be ceremonial in some way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Yet it is there to take care of the inward reality of life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It may have some outward arrangements in its service.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But this is done to take care of some inward spiritual need.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When other localities see these practices, they should not imitate.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Outward things are done to express inward reality; they are done to match inward needs.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If there is nothing inward, there should be nothing outward.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Outward things should grow out of inward things; they should overflow from inward things.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If there is nothing growing and overflowing from within, anything outward is vain imitation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is worthless and is actually harmful.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Witness</S>
