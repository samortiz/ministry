<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1><h1 class="title">THE WHOLE BODY SERVING<br />AND THE RECOVERY OF AUTHORITY</h1><h2 class="head4">(Co-workers' Meeting)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: April 14, 1948, morning<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai<br />Speakers: Watchman Nee and Witness Lee</h1><h2 class="head1">OPEN TO RECEIVE THE SUPPLY OF THE MINISTRY</h2><p>Brother Nee: In the past there were many things that we could not say or do, because we were not open to one another. When over twenty brothers recently handed themselves over to us, I told them that now I was not afraid even to take off my hat to ask for money from others. When a man has handed himself over, his position changes. There is the need for a certain degree of openness before there can be the capacity to receive a certain kind of word.</p><p>The first need today among the co-workers is to learn to be open. What we did last night [referring to the comments by the co-workers, see chapter eight] can only be done when there is openness. There are some things that we can say; there are other things that we cannot say. It is a question of position. It is a question of whether or not a person has the position to say certain kinds of words. It is also a question of motive and relationship. When you want to say something, you have to check whether your motive is right. You also must ask what kind of relationship you have with your listener. Different relationships mean that our words have to be different. In addition, we have to speak in love. Without love, we cannot speak honest words.</p><p>We have been nodding our heads and patting each other on the back for over ten years. Yet there are still many things that we dare not open up to one another. We dare not speak about these things ourselves, and others dare not speak about them either. Outsiders may not know about these problems, but we have been clear about them for a long time. We know that there are some things that we cannot say or that are hard to say.</p><p>The problem today is that the members do not want to receive the supply from others. Once a member refuses to receive the supply, all ministries stop. When some people come across difficulties, they refuse to receive the supply from others. Instead, they will only accept exhortations and supplies from those who are three miles away from them. To have to say something under such circumstances does not even touch the surface of the issue; much less can there be any deep or open words. The need today is for us to put ourselves under the authority of the Head. If a man sees the Body, he will not be hurt or caused to stumble. What is needed among the brothers and sisters is not friendship, cordiality, or tactfulness. None of these things exists in the Body.</p><p>Among us in the past, we had the supply. Yet it could not flow out even though the supply was present. In the coming days we have to look to God for mercy.</p>
