 <h2 class="head1">LEARNING THE LESSON OF BUILDING<br />
AND BRINGING OTHERS INTO THE BUILDING</h2>
<p>A person who argues about which book the church should study and doubts the decision of the elders does not have a submissive spirit or attitude. Without submission, there is no building. The building up of the church through our administration of the church and ministry of the word depends on our person. If we have learned the lesson, are broken, and know God&rsquo;s building, those whom we lead will be living stones being built up as a spiritual house. If we have not been built up, we have no way to build others up. The work in our hands will not result in building up. The more people we save through preaching the gospel and the more people we edify will only bring more opinions into the church. Even though the number of stones for the building increases, there will be no building.</p>
<p>Satan&rsquo;s work is to tear down. He has been doing this for two thousand years. Most of the gospel work in Christianity attracts people to believe by means of material gain. This is poor and superficial, and it shows that the power of the gospel has been lost. When a church is full of dissension, its condition will be weak. Since we came to Taiwan in 1949, the church in Taipei has been fresh without any dissenting factor. Satan is now attempting to do a tearing down work. When we are in one accord, we have the authority of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING CAUTIOUS WITH OUR WORDS TO<br />
AVOID BRINGING IN DISSENSION AND TEARING DOWN</h2>
<p>Some brothers are not cautious in their words, and they unconsciously bring in dissension and tearing down even though they do not have a bad intention. For example, a matter that was fellowshipped in the elders&rsquo; meeting in the afternoon may spread throughout the church by evening, mixing facts with rumors. This shows that some brothers speak too much and have not learned the lesson in the church service. We do not have any secrets, but those who have been dealt with do not speak casually. For example, I recently sent out letters inviting brothers to come for a meeting, but I did not tell my wife. Eventually she received the news from another sister. If a brother receives a letter, he should simply come on the appointed date. There is no need for him to tell others about it. This kind of casual speaking is meaningless and gives room to Satan.</p>
<p>There is nothing secretive about sending out letters about a meeting. To not spread the news that you were invited to a meeting is to reject the flesh. I had a heavy burden to call a meeting, but I did not tell my wife about it. I could not even tell my wife about my burden, so why do the brothers need to ask my wife about it? This small matter can bring in dissension and tearing down. Those who have learned the lesson will not speak carelessly in their service and coordination. Although we may speak of many different matters with people, we must know our place when we speak of matters related to the service.</p>
<p>For the purpose of giving hospitality to Brother T. Austin-Sparks, I wanted to find someone who could cook Western food. We found a cook and paid him, but he ran away with the money. The next day a brother wrote a letter in which he offered to lend me his cook. I was surprised that the news spread so quickly. A person who has learned the lesson in service would never speak of such a thing. Even if one thousand cooks ran away, why is there a need to speak of it when it has nothing to do with us? This does not mean that the cook&rsquo;s behavior is a matter that must be kept secret for fear of what others may think. The Bible records that one of Paul&rsquo;s co-workers, Demas, loved the present age (2 Tim. 4:10) and that Paul exhorted the brothers in Ephesus, saying that he who steals should steal no more (Eph. 4:28). Thus, a cook running away with money is not a strange thing. But why would this news be spread in less than two days? This indicates that we need to learn the lesson of not spreading information. Spreading information tears down.</p>
<p>A brother once remarked that others were asking him if he was going to serve in Taichung, even though he was unaware of this information. This spreading of information occurred among the serving ones. Whether or not the brother was going to Taichung, it was not necessary to spread the information. If this brother needs to fellowship regarding his service in Taichung, he will come for fellowship. We do not need to ask so many questions.</p>
<p>If we want to build up the church, we need to let the Lord deal with us in these matters. Otherwise, the more we work, the more we will tear down and the more dissension will be produced. Many unnecessary words can be spread through the serving ones. We need to ask the Lord for His mercy. The serving ones should not speak carelessly. We need to learn this lesson. We may speak with the brothers and sisters about many different things, but in our service we should not be careless to speak of things that the Lord has not committed to us. In matters pertaining to our service, we should not speak so freely.</p>
<p>Some serving ones once spread the following word: &ldquo;The elders cannot make up their mind on any matter. They are continually making changes and do not inform us of the changes.&rdquo; This shows that they have not learned to be restricted or ruled by the Lord. Although they may be consecrated to the Lord in their service, a few sentences can tear down a year&rsquo;s worth of work. They work with one hand and tear down with the other. This is not building. We need to be on the alert to see that the work in Taipei today is in discord and has fallen into Satan&rsquo;s scheme. Satan is spreading dissension through our serving.</p>
<p>If these problems are not dealt with, we will not have the building. The problems in the administration of the church and the ministry of the word are the result of the problem in our person. Please allow me to say a strong word: the spirit of insubordination is operating in our midst. Insubordination means tearing down, not building up. To be insubordinate is to not build, to not be built, and to tear down.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>In order for our work to produce the building, many negative factors within us must be eliminated and dealt with. There are certain things we should not say, certain attitudes we should not express, and certain actions we should not take. In order to submit, we need to be restricted. Because those who are not restricted are unconscious of the many dissenting factors within them, there is a dissenting element in their words. We should not put the Lord to shame or come short of our consecration. Our work must build up, not tear down. It must be in one accord, not discord.</p>
<p>It is difficult to know how much breaking and restricting we need in order for our work to be in one accord and to build up others. Although these words are strong, please receive them with a humble and meek heart. We bear a heavy responsibility before the Lord. We will each give an account to Him at His judgment seat. If our work tears down, it will hinder many from receiving grace and being edified. This is a serious matter. We must learn not only to work but also to do a work that builds up. We should never allow our words, attitudes, actions, and expressions to produce any dissension or result in any tearing down in the church. We are not here to build up human authority; rather, we are here to build up the church of God so that His authority can be expressed in the church. Therefore, there are things we should not say, actions we should not take, and attitudes we should not express. These require us to learn before the Lord.</p>
