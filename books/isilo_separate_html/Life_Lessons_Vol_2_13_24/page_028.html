In his fallen condition, man fell into the darkness of acknowledging only material riches and not God, of trusting only in material riches and not in God, and even of serving material riches, taking material riches as God, and allowing material riches to replace God. God&#8217;s enemy, Satan the Devil, exploited the fallen condition of men to come in and deceive men to worship idols, such as the god of wealth, for riches and gain. By being behind these idols, he supplants men&#8217;s worship and service that are due God. For this reason, the Lord Jesus told us that one &#8220;cannot serve God and mammon&#8221; (Matt. 6:24). In the original language, the service mentioned by the Lord here refers to the service of a slave, as we have seen in the previous lesson. This tells us that Satan utilizes material riches to seduce people to worship him on the one hand, and enslaves people in material riches, as misers, on the other hand. However, we have received God&#8217;s mercy and the Lord&#8217;s salvation, which delivered us from the authority of Satan and turned us to God (Acts 26:18). After we have received God&#8217;s salvation in this way, we are confronted with an issue in our practical living, that is, what we should do with material riches that Satan used in time past to delude us and all the world. What should our intention and attitude be toward material riches? How, in particular, should we treat these material riches? Should we be the same as we were in the old manner of living before we were saved? Or should we have a change regarding our material riches according to the salvation which delivered us from the authority of Satan and turned us to God? There are clear instructions concerning this matter in God&#8217;s word in the Bible. In the last twenty-three lessons we covered seventeen subjects concerning the various crucial matters between us and God. Now we shall consider the matter of the offering of material riches.<h2 class=head1>I. GOD&#8217;S GIVING</h2><p>1)&#8220;Nor to set their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God who affords us all things richly for our enjoyment&#8221; (1 Tim. 6:17). This word exposes Satan&#8217;s plot to delude men, showing us that all the material things and enjoyment in our living apparently come from the uncertain riches, but they actually come from God&#8217;s giving. They are supplied to us from God&#8217;s rich giving. Hence, we must not set our hope on deceitful and uncertain material riches, but on the very God who gives us all things for our enjoyment.<p><B>2)&#8220;Beloved, concerning all things I wish that you may prosper&#8221; (3 John 2). The prosperity here refers to material abundance and prosperity, pointing out that the material enjoyment of those who are saved and belong to God comes from God as a result of His prospering our material things. We ought to endeavor in our businesses. The Bible also requires that we learn to maintain good works for necessary needs (Titus 3:14, 8). Yet without God&#8217;s blessing, all our labors, endeavorings, and painstaking enterprises will yield little. Therefore, in this matter of material supply, unlike the worldly people who trust only in their own abilities, we have to learn to set our hope in God.</B><p><B>3)&#8220;Now He who bountifully supplies seed to the sower...&#8221; (2 Cor. 9:10). The Bible regards the offering of material riches as sowing. The seed is supplied by God and comes from God. This reveals that the material riches which the believers offer to God come originally from God and are given by God. We are thus offering to God what He has given to us.</B><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> </body></html>
