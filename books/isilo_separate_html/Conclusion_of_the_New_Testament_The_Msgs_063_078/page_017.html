In verses 10 through 13 the Lord tells of two men who went up to the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The prayer of the Pharisee (vv. 11-12) sounds not like a prayer but rather like an accusation of others and an arrogant boast to God. &#8220;But the tax collector, standing at a distance, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, God, be propitiated to me, the sinner!&#8221; (v. 13). This implies the need of a Redeemer and also of propitiation. The tax collector realized how his sinfulness offended God. Hence, he asked God to be propitiated, to be appeased toward him by a propitiation, so that He may be merciful and gracious to him.<p>It is significant that the tax collector said, &#8220;God, be propitiated to me, the sinner!&#8221; He realized that he had offended God and that he needed someone to be his offering of propitiation so that God would be appeased. This humbled person realized that he was nothing but a sinner. Because he offered up a prayer that was based upon God&#8217;s propitiation, he &#8220;went down to his house justified&#8221; (v. 14).<p>In 14b the Lord concludes, &#8220;Everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, but he who humbles himself shall be exalted.&#8221; Every saved person should be one who humbles himself to the same extent the tax collector did. Actually, to repent and confess our sins is to humble ourselves. All saved ones are those who have been humbled and subdued. We need to humble ourselves to such an extent that we consider ourselves nobody and nothing.<h2 class=head4>(7) Entering into the Kingdom of God</h2><p>In 18:18-30 we see that if we would enter into the kingdom of God, we need to renounce all and follow the Lord Jesus. In particular, we need to renounce material possessions.<p>Verse 18 says, &#8220;A certain ruler questioned Him, saying, Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?&#8221; To inherit eternal life is different from having eternal life. According to the Gospel of John, to have eternal life is to be saved with God&#8217;s uncreated life so that we may live by this life today and for eternity. But to inherit eternal life is to share in the manifestation of the kingdom in the coming age.<p>Eventually, the Lord Jesus said to the ruler, &#8220;Yet one thing you are lacking: all things, whatever you have, sell and distribute to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens; and come, follow Me&#8221; (v. 22). Here we see that to follow the Lord Jesus requires that we love Him above all things. This is the supreme requirement for entering into the kingdom of God.<p>When the Lord Jesus observed that this ruler became sorrowful because he was exceedingly rich, He said, &#8220;How difficult it is for those who hold on to riches to go into the kingdom of God. For it is easier for a camel to enter through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God&#8221; (vv. 24-25). The Greek word for &#8220;needle&#8221; indicates a surgeon&#8217;s needle. The Lord&#8217;s word here indicates the impossibility of entering into the kingdom of God by our natural life.<p>Those who heard the Lord&#8217;s word said, &#8220;Then who can be saved?&#8221; (v. 26). They confused salvation with the kingdom of God. The Lord&#8217;s word to the ruler concerned entering into the kingdom of God. But the disciples thought that it referred to salvation. Having the natural concept of being saved, they did not grasp the Lord&#8217;s revelation concerning entering into the kingdom of God.<p>In verse 27 the Lord Jesus went on to say, &#8220;The things that are impossible with men are possible with God.&#8221; By our human life it is impossible to enter into the kingdom of God. But this is possible by God&#8217;s life, the divine life, which is Christ Himself imparted into us so that we may live the kingdom life.<p>In verse 30 the Lord speaks of receiving eternal life in the coming age. This is the life which the overcoming believers will enjoy in the coming kingdom. To enter into this enjoyment in the coming age is to enter into the coming kingdom and participate in its enjoyment of eternal life.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> </body></html>
