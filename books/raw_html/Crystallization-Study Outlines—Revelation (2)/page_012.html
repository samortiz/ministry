<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The Triune God&mdash;the Father as the light of life, the Son as the tree of life, and the Spirit as the river of life&mdash;is the triune enjoyment of the New Jerusalem&mdash;cf. Psa. 36:8-9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God as the light shines from within the Lamb as the lamp through the New Jerusalem as the diffuser&mdash;Rev. 21:23-25, 11; 22:5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We need to keep our heart pure and single for God so that our whole inner being will be illuminated, full of light without any dark part&mdash;Matt. 5:8; 6:22-23; Luke 11:34-36.</li>

		</ol></li>
	<li>The enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life will be the eternal portion of all God&rsquo;s redeemed&mdash; Rev. 22:14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The tree of life signifies God as life to man and declares that God offers Himself to man in an edible form&mdash;Gen. 2:9; John 6:35, 57; Rev. 2:7.</li>
		<li>We are not only the eaters of this tree, enjoying the continually fresh fruit, but also the branches of this tree, abiding in Him to enjoy the life-juice&mdash;Rev. 22:2; John 15:5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The river of water of life is the flowing out of the Triune God&mdash;the Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God reaching His redeemed people for their enjoyment&mdash;Rev. 22:1:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To contact God the Spirit with our spirit is to drink of the living water, which is to render real worship to God&mdash;John 4:10, 14, 24; Isa. 12:2-6.</li>
		<li>By drinking the living water, we become the New Jerusalem, the totality of the eternal life, the destination of the flowing Triune God&mdash; John 4:14b.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Triune God&mdash;the Father as the source of life, the Son as the tree of life, and the Spirit as the flow of life&mdash;is the triune living of the New Jerusalem&mdash;Rev. 22:1-2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We need to live out the Father as the source of life on the throne&mdash;John 5:26:

		</ol></li>
	<li>We need to live out the Spirit as the bountiful supply of the processed and consummated Triune God, the flow of life&mdash;Rev. 22:1; Phil. 1:19:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The flow of the river of water of life in the New Jerusalem illustrates the fellowship of life, which is the flow of the eternal life within the believers&mdash;1 John 1:2-4; 1 Cor. 1:9; 12:24; Rev. 22:1.</li>
		<li>The flow of the river of water of life is the one stream of the Lord&rsquo;s work for His one move through His one ministry to produce and build up His one Body for His one testimony&mdash;Rev. 22:1; cf. 1 Cor. 16:10; 4:17; Acts 2:42.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Triune God&mdash;the Father as the source of the divine riches, the Son as the embodiment of the divine riches, and the Spirit as the realization of the divine riches&mdash;is the triune expression of the New Jerusalem&mdash;Rev. 21:18-21; 22:1-2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The expression of God the Father as the source of the divine riches is His communicable glory in His rich life&mdash;21:11, 21:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The first layer of the wall&rsquo;s foundation and the entire wall is built of jasper, signifying that the whole city bears the appearance of God for God&rsquo;s glory, His corporate expression&mdash;vv. 18, 11; 4:3a.</li>
		<li>The work of the apostles, who are signified by the twelve foundations, is &ldquo;layer upon layer&rdquo; and leads to the unique appearance of jasper, the appearance of God in Christ&mdash; 21:14, 19-20.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The expression of God the Son as the embodiment of the divine riches is in His person and with His work:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lamb as the redeeming person is the lamp for the expression of God as the light through the city as the light-bearer to express Himself as the glory&mdash;22:5; 21:23, 11.</li>
		<li>The work of Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection, signified by the pearls (v. 21), is a &ldquo;double cure&rdquo; that saves us from the guilt of sin through His blood and from the power of sin in His life&mdash;John 19:34; <em>Hymns,</em> #1058 (first stanza).</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The expression of God the Spirit as the realization of the divine riches is in His all-inclusiveness as the consummation of the processed Triune God:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The all-inclusive Spirit as the river of water of life flows with God, with the Lamb, with the throne, with the divine nature as the divine way, and with all the unsearchable riches of Christ to saturate our entire being&mdash; Rev. 22:1-2, 17.</li>
		<li>The Christian life must be a life in the Spirit, by the Spirit, and with the Spirit, issuing in the fruit of the Spirit, with all the divine attributes expressed in human virtues&mdash;Gal. 5:16, 22-23, 25.</li>
