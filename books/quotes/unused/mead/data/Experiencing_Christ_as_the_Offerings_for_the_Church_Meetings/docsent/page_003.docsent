   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A TESTIMONY OF THE VICTORY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second new light is this: the meeting is a testimony of the victory of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The meeting of God s people is a testimony of the victory of Christ in God s people over His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Look at the situation: when the children of Israel were there under the tyranny of Pharaoh in Egypt, there was no salvation; there was no victory over Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The children of Israel, the people of God, were all defeated and captured.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They were under a kind of tyranny.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But when they assembled at Mount Sinai that meant a victory over Pharaoh, over Egypt, over Satan, over all his demons!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today the church meetings are an exhibition of the victory of Christ over all the demons and the Devil in all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If Christ had not defeated Satan, how could we be here?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We might be at the beach or in a movie theater or in some nightclub or in a ball game.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we were in those places we were captured; we were under the tyranny of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>About sixty years ago I was there.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But hallelujah! today I am not there.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today I am on Mount Sinai meeting with all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our being here in the meeting is a testimony of the victory of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Coming to the Meeting with a Multitude</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sometimes, though, I noticed that some saints do not come to the meetings like captives who have been released.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although some have advised me not to talk so much about Elden hall the first meeting hall of the church in Los Angeles , I cannot avoid speaking about those years of 1969, 1970, 1971, and 1972.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>My! when the saints were coming to the meetings, there was the victory!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The saints came to the meetings with shoutings, with praisings, with singings, with hallelujahings!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Of course, some of the neighbors were bothered by the shoutings, the rejoicings, the singings, so they called the police to complain.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The police told those complaining neighbors that before the church came this area was terrible and even horrible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some murders had happened on the street.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But since the church came, the area had become such a nice area.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>So they encouraged the neighbors to go along with us or to consider moving.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This happened several times.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Close to three hundred saints lived right around the hall, and there were more than this coming to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The meetings at that time began in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I still remember that I gave a message using Psalm 122:1: I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I still remember my word of encouragement: Don t come to the meeting by yourself!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Always come to the meeting with a multitude!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This word multitude is used twice in Psalm 42:4.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept festival lit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>. I encouraged the saints not to come to the meeting by themselves, but to come to the meetings in company singing, praising, walking and jumping, rejoicing and hallelujahing!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>And the saints did it!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>That was wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Not Silent, but Rejoicing</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But today I notice that when the saints come to the meetings they are so silent.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They are a silent people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They are like a group of silent captives released from the poor prison.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At least you got released.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You are here and not in the casino.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The only thing is that you are not full of joy; you are not full of rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the children of Israel got released from Egypt and met at Mount Sinai, don t you believe that they rejoiced?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How can we know they rejoiced?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We know that they rejoiced because they were rejoicing on the shore of the Red Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When God delivered them out of Egypt and put Pharaoh and his army to the bottom of the sea, all the children of Israel gave a loud praise to God, especially the sisters, under the leadership of that old sister Miriam.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today we need more Miriams.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The sisters are too quiet, and the brothers are even quieter.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is why I want to share with you that the meeting of God s people is a testimony of victory over Satan, victory over the prevailing world, victory over the demons, victory over all the bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Redeemed and Released to Enjoy a Feast</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Look at the picture that the Bible portrays.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God created man with a purpose, that is, to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But this man fell again and again and again, in at least three or four stages.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Eventually this man fell into Egypt where he was altogether under Pharaoh s tyranny, having no freedom and no God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then God came in to deliver man out of Egypt, out of the usurping hand of Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But most preachers, including myself, when we have preached the gospel by such a story, never pointed out that God s salvation is one that releases people from the tyranny of Satan into a feast!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This feast implies not only the release and the freedom, but also the assembling to enjoy a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You have to realize that this assembling to enjoy a feast is a testimony of the victory of God s salvation in all His redeemed people over His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If one is redeemed, yet is not in that feast, it is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the situation with many Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Many have been saved, but very few are in the feast.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>At Elden hall the attendance of the meetings was very high.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we had three hundred people, nearly all three hundred were present in every meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Sometimes even the attendance at the prayer meeting was higher.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If the attendance of a local church is low, this is a sign that the saints do not realize and enjoy the victory of Christ so much.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we enjoy the victory of Christ, surely we will join the feast.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We will plunge ourselves into the feast!</S>
