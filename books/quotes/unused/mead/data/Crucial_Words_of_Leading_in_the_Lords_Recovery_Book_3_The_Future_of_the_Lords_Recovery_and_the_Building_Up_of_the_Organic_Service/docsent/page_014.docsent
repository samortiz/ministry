   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX LABORING WITH NO OPINIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND TAKING THE BODY AS THE GOAL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE SERVICE IN THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we will consider the way that the church in Taipei should go on.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the early days all our meetings were small; hardly any locality had more than fifty saints when it was established.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Most localities began with ten to twenty saints and then gradually increased, but few localities ever reached one hundred saints.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 1933 the church in Shanghai was one of the few localities that had more than one hundred saints.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When I first went to Shanghai in 1933 and saw the meetings with more than one hundred saints, I thought it was a very large locality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 1940 the church in Chefoo had a sudden increase in numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the time the whole church preached the gospel, and we used the expression the church preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Prior to this, no locality had baptized more than forty people in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, in 1940 the church in Chefoo began baptizing more than one hundred people in a meeting, and we continued to baptize large numbers of people every month.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church in Shanghai stopped meeting during the Sino-Japanese war.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After the war, when the meetings were resumed, there were only about one hundred saints at the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church in Shanghai was restored in the summer of 1946, and I returned to Shanghai in 1947.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After six months the number of saints in the church in Shanghai increased tremendously.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The increase in the number of saints included many brothers and sisters who were restored and also newly saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Due to this increase in the number of saints, we began breaking bread in different districts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Breaking bread in districts, however, began in the church in Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Before the end of the Sino-Japanese War the church in Chefoo met in four to six districts.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In 1947 when the church in Shanghai began to break bread in districts, there were about seventeen districts with a total of one thousand saints.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>MEETING ACCORDING TO THE SCRIPTURES</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is comparatively easy to meet according to the Scriptures when our numbers are small.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The larger our numbers, the more difficult it is to meet according to the Scriptures; it also becomes especially difficult to lead the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have spent much time studying the Bible concerning how to meet, and we have found three main points.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First, in the book of Acts, when their numbers increased, the believers in the church in Jerusalem met from house to house 2:46 , but the Bible does not give any details of what the believers did when they met.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Second, in 1 Corinthians 14:26 Paul gives the principle that in the meetings each one has a portion with which to supply others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Third, in 2 Timothy 2:2 Paul charges Timothy to commit the things which he had heard to faithful men, who are able to teach others also.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This shows that besides Timothy others were also commissioned to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These are points we discovered in the Bible concerning the way to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Bible does not give details or methods for Christian meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But we received help from Brother Nee to see that in the New Testament the principle for Christian meetings is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Brother Nee said emphatically that the New Testament does not present definite ways concerning how to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christian meetings in the New Testament are entirely a matter of the Spirit, not of letters and regulations, even though it is easier to follow regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A school, a hospital, or any other social organization must have by-laws in order to operate, but the New Testament only gives the principles of meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is no clear word on how to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>OUR MEETINGS AND</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE LEADING IN THE CHURCH IN TAIPEI</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We examined the way many different denominations meet, but the way they meet was of no use to us, because their meetings are worldly and full of human opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the number of saints meeting in the church in Shanghai was more than one thousand, we had about sixteen districts.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then the political situation forced us to stop meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When I moved from Shanghai to Taipei in 1949, there were few local people in the churches in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Most of the saints, about five hundred, came from the mainland and worked with government agencies, schools, and hospitals; there were also a few businessmen.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These brothers and sisters came from more than thirty provinces in mainland China, and they were scattered throughout the island of Taiwan from Keelung and Yilan in the north to Kaohsiung and Pingtung in the south.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I traveled to the different towns and visited these brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even though we began with only four to five hundred brothers and sisters, in five to six years there were fifty churches established in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This was the Lord s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When Brother Sparks came in 1955, there were thirty thousand brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In 1958 Brother Sparks visited Taiwan a second time.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This was a mistake, and as a result, there was an incalculable loss among us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In 1959 we had more than forty thousand saints half of whom were in the church in Taipei when the dissenting ones began an undermining work.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Since the beginning of Christianity in the Far East, few groups have had a membership of twenty thousand believers with two thousand believers attending their meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The church in Taipei can be considered the first Christian meeting with such numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This was before we suffered the storm.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our numbers were unprecedented in the history of Christianity in the Far East.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In 1961 I went to America and received a burden for America.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I did not give up the churches in Taiwan, but the main burden for Taiwan was no longer on my shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The way to lead the church in Taipei has been a problem for a period of more than twenty years, from 1961 until the present.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In other words, for over twenty years we have been unable to find a direction for the churches in Taiwan, especially for the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When I left Taiwan, the church in Taipei met in halls, districts, and groups.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In 1961 there were more than twenty districts in Taipei, and every district had several groups.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Based on Acts 2:46 we called the meetings in the districts house meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>According to this verse the believers met from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We also met in groups based on Mark 6:39-40, where the Lord Jesus asked the five thousand people to sit down in groups.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>By meeting in districts and in groups our need was met; however, our numbers did not increase.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Even though I have not been in Taiwan for twenty years, I still have a burden related to the leading of the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We need to consider how to lead the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The churches in the Lord s recovery all began with a small number of saints, and we always did our best, seeking light and leading from the Scriptures, to return to the practices in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is rather easy to practice our meetings according to the Scriptures when there are few saints, but it is not so easy when our numbers increase.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Our increase in numbers began in a revival in 1942 in the church in Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is when the meetings in the church in Shanghai had stopped due to the Japanese persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I learned much during the revival in Chefoo; we had no experience prior to the revival.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>After the Japanese invasion and my sickness, the brothers asked me to go south to Shanghai and Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>After less than a year in Nanking, our numbers increased, and we learned new things.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I have been working since then, and I am still learning, even in America.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In 1957 we felt that our meetings needed to go a step further.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But due to the storm in 1959, we did not have the opportunity to advance.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This was Satan s work, and it occupied all our time and effort.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We truly suffered a great loss.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Since I left Taiwan and went abroad, I have been fully occupied with the spread of the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The environment abroad is somewhat similar to our initial situation; there are groups consisting of thirty to fifty saints spread out across America.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Some localities have increased to one hundred saints, and a few localities have two to three hundred, but there is not one church with five hundred saints.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Therefore, the need in America is not as great as the need in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Anyone who has studied the truth will acknowledge that we must consider our situation when we practice the light of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is similar to learning to drive.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It may be easy when we are training, but when we actually get out on the road to drive, we need to be able to respond to different situations.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is not so easy.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Even though I received a burden to go abroad, my heart was still in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I have been observing the situation, and I feel that the problem in Taiwan has never been resolved.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The co-workers do not know the proper way to work; they are thus unable to meet the need in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>It is as if they have a factory, capital, raw materials, a market, and laborers, but they do not know how to manage these resources.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If a person wants to be successful in business, he must make plans and work according to his situation.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>He should use his resources to produce a product that meets the demand in the market.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The number of saints in the church in Taipei has not increased since 1961.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We can say that from that time until the present, there has been no progress.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>I have not been able to give any direction, because I was not able to be personally involved.</S>
