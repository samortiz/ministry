Balak and All the Rulers of Moab<br>Standing beside Balaam's Burnt Offering,<br>and Jehovah Putting a Word in Balaam's Mouth,<br>and Balaam Prophesying in a Parable</H2><P>Balak and all the rulers of Moab stood beside Balaam's burnt offering (vv. 3, 6). Jehovah put a word in Balaam's mouth, and Balaam prophesied in a parable (vv. 4-5, 7-10).</P><P>The situation here was quite strange. The offerings were not offered to Jehovah; rather, in an ambiguous way, they were offered to Baal. Nevertheless, for the sake of His people Israel, God ruled over Balaam. No doubt, Balaam had the desire and the intention in his heart to curse Israel that he might please Balak and receive more money. But as the One who was watching and ruling, the Lord put a word in Balaam's mouth, and Balaam had no choice but to speak God's word.</P><P>The word in verses 7 through 10 was surely inspired by God. The human mind is not able to compose such a parable, a parable which Balaam spoke as a prophecy. This is strong evidence that the Bible was inspired by the living, almighty, and speaking God. Let us now look into certain aspects of Balaam's first parable.</P><P>Balak had said to Balaam, "Come, curse Jacob for me,/And come, denounce Israel" (v. 7b). However, this was impossible. Balaam said, "How can I curse him whom God has not cursed?/How can I denounce him whom Jehovah has not denounced?/For from the top of the rocks I see him,/From the hills I behold him./Behold, a people that will dwell alone,/And will not reckon themselves among the nations!" (vv. 8-9). The word about the children of Israel's dwelling alone and not reckoning themselves among the nations indicates that they were a holy, sanctified people, a people set apart from the nations.</P><P>In verse 10 Balaam went on to say, "Who can count the dust of Jacob,/Or number the fourth part of Israel?/Let me die the death of the upright,/And let my end be like theirs!" Here we see the blessing of increase. Jacob, like the dust, will be numberless, countless. No one will be able to count even the fourth part of Israel. Furthermore, the word concerning the death of the upright is a word of great blessing and appreciation.</P><P>The first parable was a blessing upon the children of Israel as a separate people, a particular and special class of people who dwell alone and who are not reckoned among the nations. Because this people will be blessed with abundant increase, no one will be able to number them. After uttering this great blessing, Balaam expressed his appreciation of Israel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. Balak Complaining to Balaam<br>That He Had Blessed Israel instead of Cursing Them</H2><P>Balaam's word of blessing and appreciation concerning Israel offended Balak. This was the reason Balak said to him, "What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and you have altogether blessed them!" (v. 11). To this Balaam replied, "Must I not take heed to speak what Jehovah puts in my mouth?" (v. 12).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_131.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_133.html">Next</a> </body></html>
