   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FROM ZARAH TO PHAREZ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 38:27-30 we see the shifting of the birthright from Zarah to Pharez.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This case illustrates the fact that the granting of the birthright does not depend on man's doing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Zarah was trying to come out first.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He "put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first" v. 28 . But human doing cannot manage, direct, or guide the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although the midwife never thought that Pharez would be born first, Pharez was actually born first v. 29 . When he came out, the midwife said in surprise, "How hast thou broken forth?" v. 29 . The Hebrew here is very difficult to translate.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It may be rendered, "Wherefore hast thou made a breach for thyself?" or, "How hast thou made a breach!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Breach be upon thee!" or, "What a breach you have made for yourself!"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The midwife had to admit that Pharez had obtained the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, receiving the birthright does not depend on man's maneuvering.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>FROM REUBEN TO JOSEPH</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The third case of the shifting of the birthright, the shifting from Reuben to Joseph 49:3-4; 1 Chron 5:1 , contains a strong warning.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Reuben, the firstborn, lost the birthright because of his defilement.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God had intended to give the birthright to Reuben, the firstborn, but Reuben lost it by indulging in defilement.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The birthright was shifted from Reuben to Joseph, who fled from that kind of defilement 39:7-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God is just.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He took the birthright from the one who indulged in defilement and gave it to the one who fled from it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although the birthright was shifted from Reuben to Joseph, Joseph received only the double portion of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He did not receive the priesthood or the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Rather, Levi received the priesthood and Judah, the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Never think of fornication as something insignificant.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God hates it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We live in an age of Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The whole world today, including the United States and especially Sweden and France, is a Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many men and women live together without being married.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Certainly this will bring in God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the Bible God exercised a special judgment over Sodom because the people there indulged in lust without any restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Nothing offends God more than this indulgence.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Nevertheless, many young people today, even young women, have no sense of shame regarding this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Indulging in fornication will always cause you to suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There will be no need for God to judge you deliberately because a natural judgment will come upon you spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The case of Reuben reveals that, although you may be predestinated to have the birthright, you may lose it by indulging in fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Every Christian who commits fornication will lose his birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This birthright includes the full enjoyment of Christ with the priesthood and the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To have the birthright is to have the right and the position to enjoy Christ in full.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is also to have the right to be priests and kings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we lose our birthright, we lose the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Any Christian who commits fornication loses this enjoyment immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This sin will also keep any believer from being a priest and a king.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Furthermore, no fornicator will enter into the millennial kingdom to have the fullest enjoyment of Christ and to be a priest of God and a king with Christ 1 Cor 6:9-10; Gal 5:19-21; Eph 5:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only the overcomers will share this enjoyment, be God's priests, and be the co-kings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Take heed: defilement may cause you to lose your birthright.</S>
