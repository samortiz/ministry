   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Chekiang Province One</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Yesterday, I read the third issue of The Open Door and rejoiced to learn that the work in the remote areas is actively being pursued.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Brother Hu Yi-min invited me to go with him last year, but my business and family entangled me, and I dared not agree rashly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, I am very concerned about the work, and it seems as if I have already gone there.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I am asking the Gospel Book Room to pass on X dollars for the gospel work in Yunnan.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Please use it for the front lines.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is such a small amount that it can only show my support and oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have already sent it to K'un-ming to be forwarded to Yeh-Ji Editor.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The region of Taichow in Chekiang is mountainous and close to the sea.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I came to Huang-Yen with Brother Shan Kai-fen on December 18.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Brother Shan preached a few times in Shi-Ju-Dien Chapel and Jin Ching Harbor Chapel, but he did not speak the local dialect, so he went back to Shao-Shing before I did.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I stayed and then went to Hai-Men.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These dates are already set.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I will let God Himself lead me as to the future.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I have really seen God's own leading and blessing in the work in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>May glory be to the Lord's holy name!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Your little brother,</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Two</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I received the fifth issue of The Open Door.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The number of pages in this last issue has increased, and they all told of the Father's blessings upon the work in all the places.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I give much praise and thanks to the Lord, but I was also warned very much.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I have been working with two Western missionaries, Mr. Milton and Mr. Mullen, at Hai-Men and Da-Fen.</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>From there I went on to work in Lin-Hai for five days.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thank the Lord, several intellectuals and Buddhists came and were happy to hear the word, receive the Bible, and diligently search everything.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How can an ignorant one such as I handle such work?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>May the glory and blessing go to our heavenly Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Anglican Church in Lin-Hai wanted me to hold a conference there for seven days.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, I feel that if I work without stopping, it will not be good for either my spirit or my body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I reluctantly agreed to speak for three days, two messages a day.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>During these three days, my spirit was bound and my prayer could not get through.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On the evening before the first meeting, I had a dark vision in my dream and intended to cancel the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But the announcements were made.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If I did not go, it would be unfaithfulness on my part.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But if I went, I would feel quite unable to fulfill my task.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I was in quite a bind.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As a result, I failed in my work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, God is my joy.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I gained a good brother through these meetings, Brother Hsie Xiao-you, the principal of the Jing-Ai Elementary School.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He has been reading the publications from the Gospel Book Room for many years.</S>
