   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX BREAKING AND DISCIPLINE CONSECRATION AND DISCIPLINE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order for our outer man to be broken, we need to consecrate ourselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Consecration, however, does not take care of all the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is only an expression of our intention to willingly give ourselves unconditionally, unreservedly, and unequivocally to God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We can consecrate ourselves to God in just a few minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This willingness to offer ourselves unreservedly to Him only constitutes the initial step in our spiritual journey.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It does not mean that God has finished all of His work with this one step.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whether or not a man can be used by God does not depend on consecration alone.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After consecration there is still the need of discipline from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is very important, and whether or not we will become useful to God depends a great deal on this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The discipline of the Holy Spirit must be added to our consecration before we can become a useful vessel to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Without consecration, it often will be hard to go on with the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, consecration alone cannot replace the Spirit's discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, we have to turn our attention to the matter of the Spirit's discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In consecration we offer ourselves to God according to the light we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In disciplining us the Holy Spirit deals with us according to the light that He dispenses to us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can only consecrate according to what we know.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We can only consecrate according to what we can see with our spiritual eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In reality even we do not know how much is included in our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The amount of light we have received is not infinite; our light is very limited.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even when we think that we have the greatest light, God's eyes still may find us in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What we consecrate to God according to our perceived light will never satisfy His demand.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In other words, God's demand is always higher than what we can offer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our consecration cannot satisfy God's heart because our knowledge is limited and our light is limited.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the discipline of the Holy Spirit is altogether different; it evaluates our need in God's own light.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is not what we see, but what God sees.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He knows that we have certain needs, and He operates through His Spirit in the environment for us to experience these things, the purpose of which is to break our outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, the disciplining work of the Holy Spirit goes far beyond our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is many times greater than our consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is a big difference here.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The work of the Holy Spirit is based on the light of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Spirit works according to what God sees.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, only the discipline of the Holy Spirit is thorough and complete.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We often are ignorant in ourselves; we do not know what we need to go through.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even our wisest choices are full of errors.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What we think we need often is not what we actually need according to God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What we see from our side may only be a tiny fraction of the whole picture.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Holy Spirit, however, orders things for us according to God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The discipline of the Holy Spirit far exceeds what our mind can fathom.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We often are not prepared for a certain discipline, and we think that there is no need for it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When the Spirit's discipline does come upon us, we are taken by surprise.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What the Spirit has ordered for us in the environment is not what we expected.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Much discipline from the Holy Spirit comes without any warning from God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Suddenly we are struck with a heavy blow.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We may think that we are living under God's light, but to God this light may be a very feeble flicker.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He may not even consider it as light at all.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Holy Spirit, however, deals with us according to God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We think that we know our condition, but actually we do not.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only God knows us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>From the time we accepted Him, He has been ordering our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Everything that He has ordered is for our greatest benefit because He knows us and He knows our needs.</S>
