   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every gate bears the name of one tribe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is a sign signifying that the gates are living people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The word Israel here indicates that the New Jerusalem is composed of all the redeemed saints of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>2.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Revelation 21:14 says, "The wall of the city had twelvefoundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The fact that the names of the twelve apostles are on the twelve foundations of the wall indicates that the New Jerusalem as the holy city is composed not only of the Old Testament saints, represented by Israel, but also of the New Testament saints, represented by the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The New Testament believers are not for the gates; they are for the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The gates are for propagation and entrance, whereas the wall is for separation and protection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>B. The Twelve Gates on Four Sides, with Three Gates on Each Side, Signifying the Mingling of Man, Who Is One of the Four Living Creatures, with God, Who Is Triune</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Twelve is the number of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the New Jerusalem there are the twelve foundations with the names of the twelve apostles, twelve gates which are twelve pearls with the names of the twelve tribes, and twelve fruits of the tree of life Rev 22:2 .</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Four refers to us as God's creatures, and three refers to the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The number twelve in the New Jerusalem is not arrived at by addition but by multiplication.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The processed Triune God is mingled with His creature, man, in His eternal administration in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>C. The City Proper</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A Mountain of Gold</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The New Jerusalem, the holy city, is a mountain of gold Rev 21:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The entire city has one street 21:21; 22:1 , yet this one street reaches all twelve gates.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On top of the mountain is a throne, from which the street spirals down to the bottom to reach the twelve gates.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One street, descending from the top to the bottom, reaches and serves all twelve gates.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The street, therefore, must be a spiral street, spiraling down the mountain until it circles around to all twelve gates.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As a mountain of gold, the New Jerusalem is the ultimate, unique, and eternal golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Upon this stand is a lamp Christ with God in Him as the light shining out through eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The holy city as a mountain of gold is the aggregate of all the lampstands 1:20 , the totality of today's lampstands, shining forth God's glory in eternity in the new heaven and the new earth.</S>
