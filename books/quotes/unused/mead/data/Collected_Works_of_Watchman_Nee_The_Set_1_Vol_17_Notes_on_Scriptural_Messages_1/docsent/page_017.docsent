   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>JOHN 12:25</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"He who loves his soul-life loses it; and he who hates his soul-life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord says here that it is possible for one to lose his soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One loses his soul-life only because he loves it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What is it to love the soul-life?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It means to gratify our desires and please our emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For example, the Lord calls us to stay away from a certain matter; if we want to obey Him, we must lay down our self.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Each time we want to obey the Lord, we must lay down the self.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we seek to do His will while loving our soul-life, we will fail.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Perhaps the Lord wants us to drop something which we enjoy doing or give up a person or an object we like.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we love our soul-life, we will not succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many times we are entangled with a person, thing, or matter.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many are beset by friends; they would rather have the friends than lose the soulish enjoyment in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We recognize that many of the bad things are sins.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, we do not realize that we can also be entangled by the things we normally enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are aware that money is too base and contemptible a thing to be mentioned, yet many cannot part with it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even a dress or a meal may ensnare a person.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Why is it so difficult for man not to love his soul-life?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because not loving the soul-life means to cause it to suffer, while loving the soul-life means not to allow it to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Such a person, however, will undoubtedly lose his soul-life because he has already cared for his soul-life and allowed it to enjoy!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When does one lose his soul-life?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It will be when the Lord establishes His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whoever loves his soul-life in this age will not enjoy glory or reign with the Lord at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To have eternal life through faith is certain; our going to heaven is certain.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But to reign as a king and ensure that the soul-life will find enjoyment in the millennium requires that we do not love our soul-life today.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Brothers and sisters, I have said before and I say again: God gives sinners a choice between heaven and hell.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a sinner can see clearly, no doubt he will choose heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now God gives Christians a choice between the kingdom and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do we choose the kingdom?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Or do we choose the world?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How sad that although a sinner prefers heaven, many Christians prefer to have the world!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We think that it is good enough to be saved, yet after we are saved, God still puts the coming kingdom before us for us to choose.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those who are full now will not be filled in glory; they will lose their enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord said that whoever loves himself shall lose his soul-life; whoever hates his soul-life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our soul is linked to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To love the soul in this world means to care for ourselves in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Good food, nice clothing, friends, happiness, compliments, fame all are desirable.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, they nourish the soul-life as food nourishes us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To nourish the soul-life now is to lose the soul-life in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To lose the soul-life is not to be cast into hell.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is to cause the soul to suffer in that it cannot reign with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the kingdom age, the Lord will assign ten cities or five cities for us to rule.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to the Old Testament prophets, this will be such a pleasant time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How pleasant it will be to rule ten cities or five cities in such an atmosphere!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, whoever has already gained his soul-life in this world shall lose his soul-life in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is serious!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whoever is full now and has satisfied his soul-life in the present age, will not gain anything in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I have said this many times, and I will keep saying it: to hate the soul-life in this world is to not allow the soul-life to have satisfaction and enjoyment in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is to turn your back to the world and your face to God, and to be armed with a will to suffer, whatever the situation may be.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If one does this, he will gain his soul-life in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you gain something here, it follows that you will lose something there.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Either you gain or you lose.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To gain today is to suffer loss in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To gain in the future, you must suffer loss today.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Once a person believes, it is definite that he has eternal life, and it is definite that every believer will be in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But before heaven and earth pass away, some believers will have no part in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>"He who hates his soul-life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, please pay attention to this: the Lord hates two things.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>First, He hates our sins; second, He hates our soul-life, which is just our self.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Because the Lord hates our sins, He died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>By believing in Him, we receive eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Because the Lord hates our soul-life, He wants to do away with it that is, to eliminate the soulish life, not the function of the soul .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Here is the difference between the soul-life and sins: whatever the soul desires may not be sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Lying, pride, jealousy, etc., are sins.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But to wear what you should not wear or eat what you should not eat is the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Nice clothing, good food, and extravagant spending cannot be considered sinful, but they certainly gratify the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Madame Guyon was one who was very deep in the Lord during the seventeenth century.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>She clearly realized the difference between sins and the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>She did not express it in the same way we do, yet her experiences verified the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>She was born and raised in France; her family was related to the class of nobility, and she had the title of "Madame."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Each time she visited Paris, she was fearful because she knew very well that her heart would be moved by the things she saw.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Later, she overcame this.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, she became fearful of another thing: to look into the mirror.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>She was very attractive; the more she looked at herself in the mirror, the more she was conscious of her beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>She even thought that when she walked, she carried herself far more gracefully than all the other women.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The soul is man's natural nature, that is, the nature he has as a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If a person believes in the Lord and overcomes sins, he can enter heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But if he puts away the soul-life and overcomes it, he can enter the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The reason God does not allow us to indulge ourselves in the matter of clothing, food, and shelter in this age is that these things have already been infected with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>To possess these things is to be contaminated with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Today even a dress or a meal readily causes us to fall into the world.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>However, when we are in the kingdom, no matter how much we appreciate the beautiful scenery, it will only cause us to praise God's creation the more.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Even the appreciation of ourselves at that time will only motivate us to praise God for His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>There will be no trace of sin in the kingdom because Satan will be bound and sin will not be in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When God's Son was on the earth, the only thing He took was the cross; the rest was borrowed.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The manger was borrowed; the inn was borrowed; the donkey which carried Him into Jerusalem was borrowed; and the room where they kept the Passover feast was borrowed.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Finally, even the tomb was borrowed.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He had nothing that was not borrowed.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>How different we are from Him!</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Those who overcome sins go to heaven; those who overcome the world go to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This is certain.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>God is calling us for this one thing to not love the world and only desire the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>He wants us to hate our self and seek after the kingdom.</S>
