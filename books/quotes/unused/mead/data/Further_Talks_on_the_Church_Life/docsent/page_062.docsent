   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Kuling Will Furnish Help</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What should we do here in Kuling Mountain?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The local churches should send promising ones here to be given one or two months of spiritual help.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then they will be sent back to their localities to bear some responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The co-workers should always bear the responsibility of the work in the center, but they also should go out and return again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we do this, the work will have a way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Need for Coordination</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For this reason, during the conferences in both Shanghai and Foochow, we paid much attention to the matter of coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Nothing will work without coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the past, we were all going our own way, but without coordination nothing can be done properly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No one should act independently; everyone must give himself to be properly coordinated.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I believe that the gospel will spread quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Moreover, I believe that it will be easy for us to take over the whole of China.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For instance, if the brothers in Foochow are faithful, it will be very easy for them to take over Fukien province and the island of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the brothers in other localities are also faithful and learn to take this way, they will also be able to take over their places.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today we have found the way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now it is altogether a matter of the person.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The way cannot be clearer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we do not see the principle of Jerusalem, we will feel that there is something in the Word of God which does not fit; it seems as if there is some problem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today we have to declare that the whole book of Acts fits in very well; there is no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, each time I read the book of Acts now, I marvel at the way Peter conducted himself in the first part.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I think Peter has been unjustly accused for two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Peter's going out and coming back to Jerusalem was altogether correct.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Undoubtedly, there are centers for God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Ministry of the Word No Longer Being a Problem</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we take this way, the matter of the ministry of the word will no longer be a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All we have to do is maintain such a ministry in one central locality.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The other localities need to be led to take care of themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There will be no problem with the ministry of the word if the local ones are the ones that are taking care of the matter themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is for this cause that we in Kuling are preparing a place for training.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the future we will bring all the good, prospective ones from all the churches here to receive some training.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then we will send them back.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, I will do my work and you will do your work, each one attending to his own work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I believe that we can soon get through this way and strong testimonies can be built up continuously in many localities.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Foundation of the Work</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The foundation of all the work today is here.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If this becomes confused, everything will be confused, and we will revert back to the situation before our gathering in Hankow.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Hankow we only saw the matter of the church; at that time we did not see the matter of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now the way of the work is before us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we have the right people and the mercy of the Lord is with us, within a few years the gospel will be spread all over China.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I believe this is a great eventuality to preach the gospel to all of China.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Unless we take this way, the situation will remain the same for fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I acknowledge that much of God's blessing has been in our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the past I have said that God always saves people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As a matter of fact, God has saved quite a number of people in our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, I always feel that this is not enough; we still have not saved enough people.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Recently, we all gave ourselves to study the Bible again.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I myself have read God's Word once or twice again.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I find God's Word becoming so very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the past we only saw the way of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We did not see the way of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When the way of the work is not proper, the way of the church is not proper either.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We thank God for His mercy upon us that today He has opened our eyes to see this way after so many years.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The brothers in a locality must always bear their responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They must practice coordination, and they must migrate to other places group by group to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is a very simple matter.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Jerusalem had great success in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Before God, Jerusalem represents the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The heavenly Jerusalem represents the church, and the earthly Jerusalem also represents the church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Peter was always working there, and as a result, many people went out to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Never do we see the gospel coming to an end when the people left.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The gospel will go on continually.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is exceedingly glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>TODAY'S REQUIREMENT BEING FAITHFUL IN COORDINATION</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, today there is a requirement not only for the co-workers to be coordinated but for the leading ones to be coordinated as well.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>None of us can choose freely.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In this way the church will preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Every person, no matter where he goes, must go for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Their mouth must be for the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We need to go out as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I believe that the Lord will have His way today.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we are not trustworthy and faithful, the Lord will choose others to take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I believe that it is possible for Him to do this, but it would take at least another twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Do not say that the Lord will not lay us aside.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Lord can easily lay us aside, but it would waste another twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We expect to save twenty years for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>May the Lord have mercy on us so that we may catch up.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Let us give our all for this.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>After passing through very burdensome and difficult experiences, He has shown us this way.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>May we not forsake it.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>A message given by Watchman Nee and recorded by Brother Chou on the morning of August 19, 1948.</S>
