   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FRUIT BEARING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CAUSING US TO REALIZE OUR SHORTAGE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we rise up to bear fruit and care for the young ones, we will realize our shortage.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We will realize that we do not have enough growth in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To be a Christian we need to grow, but we may have been in the Lord and in the church for many years without the proper growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may have been content merely to come to the meetings without any desperation for the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We would be bothered if our child had no growth after several years, Likewise, we all have to be bothered about our lack of growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The way some dear saints speak and consider the things concerning the church indicates that they are not only childish but also babyish.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They have too little growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The reason we may lack the growth in life but still be content is that we do not care for fruit bearing and taking care of the young ones.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Once we rise up to bear fruit and care for spiritual children, we will discover that we need the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>OUR NEED FOR THE GROWTH IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>AND SKILL IN CONTACTING PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many saints have been spiritually disabled by the lack of growth in life and the shortage of skill.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the one hand, we may lack the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the other hand, even if we go to contact people, we may not have the skill to converse with them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To speak to people properly requires much learning and coaching.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Without being taught by a coach, we will not be able to play ball.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We will just play in the natural way, which is not effective.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to be coached in every aspect of speaking to people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After being coached for a short time, we will be able to speak very skillfully.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is not right to be fruitless, but to bear fruit requires skill.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, there is the need of much learning.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must endeavor to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all can use our leisure time to learn something for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Daily we may need eight hours for sleeping and eight hours for working.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This leaves some leisure time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Worldly leisure leads us into sin, but using our leisure time for spiritual matters leads us into fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Using our leisure time in this way will benefit us, our family, our relatives, and society.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must learn how to contact people, how to reach people, and how to converse with people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the past we preached the gospel in a casual way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We simply invited people to a gospel meeting every several months.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We did not need to learn to speak or to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A good speaker took care of the preaching in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This idle way of letting others serve the Lord for us offends the Lord and offends the principle of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church is the Body of Christ, and just as every part of our body functions, all the members of the Body of Christ function.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Simply to invite people to a meeting is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We cannot expect that there will be many excellent speakers among us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It may even be that in a certain local church there are no good speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, that church must still do something to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Not everyone can be a good cook, but everyone can cook something.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>No family can survive simply by inviting good cooks to cook for them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Such a family will eventually starve.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Everyone can cook.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After cooking for a certain time, we will learn to cook well.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we cannot cook well, it is because we have not practiced.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To depend upon a great evangelist for fruit bearing is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There are not many big evangelists among us, and those who may be such persons should restrict their functioning in order to let all the saints exercise their function.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is not good for a shoulder to function in a way which annuls the function of the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The annulling of the functions of the members is a paralysis in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have to keep every part of the Body active and functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then the Body will be healthy.</S>
