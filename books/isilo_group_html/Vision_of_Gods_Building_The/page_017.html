Jacob had become a wanderer in the wilderness with no home and no rest. But one night in his wandering he saw in a wonderful dream a ladder set up with its base on this earth, a base which could be called the house of God or the gate of heaven. He saw the thing which brings heaven and God down to this earth (Gen. 28:11-22). Praise the Lord, on this earth there can be such a gate of heaven. We need not go to heaven: here on this earth the gate of heaven can be realized. Such a place is called Bethel, the house of God. How wonderful that God could have a house on this earth!<p>The Scripture&#8217;s first mention of the house of God was in Jacob&#8217;s dream. My hope is that we all may have such a dream. Oh, may we all see that presently on this earth there is the possibility of having the house of God!<p>I received much teaching as a youth from many dear Christian teachers concerning this earth as a foul and Godforsaken place. I was taught that God&#8217;s intention is to build something in the heavens. In due time, I was told, we will all be brought to our heavenly home, there to be built up by God, while the whole earth will pass away. However, if we say that the earth will pass away, we must realize that the heaven also will pass away (Matt. 24:35; Heb. 1:10-12). Indeed, Scripture clearly states that we will have a new heaven, and we will also have a new earth. And in this new environment. God will not be in the new heaven, but will come down to this new earth. The New Jerusalem will descend out of heaven (Rev. 21:2, 10). You may prefer to go to heaven, but God prefers to come down to the earth.<p>Praise God that Jacob had such a dream, that even on this rebellious, usurped earth there is the possibility for God&#8217;s house to stand. We must believe that in every city today it is possible to have a Bethel-God&#8217;s house. Let us not be misled by the erroneous teachings which say that it is all wondrously in the future and in the heavens, that we cannot have a proper church life on earth today. We cannot find any such teaching in the New Testament. Contrariwise, the Scriptures tell us of a church in Jerusalem (Acts 8:1), a church in Antioch (Acts 13:1), a church in Corinth (1 Cor. 1:2), a church in Ephesus (Rev. 2:1), and most of the other cities the Apostles visited. But there is not a single mention of a church in heaven. We must abandon these teachings. The church must be established on this earth as God&#8217;s Bethel, God&#8217;s expression. Oh, may we have such a dream! We are just like Jacob: we have been wandering long enough. It is time that we stop our wandering and see the house of God established on this earth, even in every city. Hallelujah, it is possible! You can have a prevailing and proper church life in your city, but you must continually dream about this possibility of having God&#8217;s Bethel on this earth.<p>Bethel is not only a place, but also a stone. The stone upon which Jacob rested his head is indeed interesting. Jacob set up that stone and poured oil upon it, saying, &#8220;This stone shall be God&#8217;s house [Bethel]&#8221; (Gen. 28:22). The house of God is not just a place, but a stone, upon which oil is poured. It is amazing how such a &#8220;supplanter&#8221; had this wisdom. Only God could have inspired him with this. Jacob&#8217;s act and words correspond completely with the entire revelation of Scripture. Oil is the symbol of the Holy Spirit. And the Holy Spirit is the last person of the Godhead, who comes and mingles Himself with us. The pouring of oil upon that stone signifies God being poured upon His creation.<p>As God&#8217;s creation, we human beings were originally made of clay; we were not a stone. When Peter recognized the Lord Jesus as the Christ, the Son of God, the Lord told him: &#8220;Thou art Peter&#8221; (Matt. 16:16-18). What the Lord meant was that Simon must have his name changed to Peter-a stone. This proves that by believing in the Lord Jesus we may be changed in our nature, changed from clay into stone.<p>The Apostle Peter in his Epistles later revealed that the Lord Jesus is the living stone, and that we also are living stones to be built up together as the house of God (1 Pet. 2:4, 5). We have been changed in nature. Originally we were clay, but today in Christ we are stones. In Adam we are clay, but in Christ we are stones. Jacob&#8217;s act of pouring oil upon that stone signifies the pouring of the Triune God upon regenerated people. Such is Bethel, the house of God. Whenever and wherever there is a group of regenerated persons poured upon with the Triune God, that is the reality of Bethel, the house of God. This can take place upon this earth today. Oh, do not look for a way to go to a future house of God in the heavens! Claim it today on this earth. Stand upon the dream of Jacob. His dream must be our dream. Tell the Lord: &#8220;Lord, I am part of this dream. I claim that even on this earth today, even in my city, You must have a Bethel.&#8221; Remember, Bethel is just a group of real believers anointed with the Holy Spirit and built together, believers who have been regenerated and transformed from pieces of clay into living stones, anointed and built into one by the Triune God. Oh, may we realize such a clear vision concerning the house of God!<p>The main points concerning Jacob&#8217;s dream are: firstly, the possibility that on this earth the house of God can be realized; secondly, the oil poured upon the stone to make it God&#8217;s house, signifying God being poured upon His people to build them together as His dwelling. Jacob, as Abraham&#8217;s third generation, saw God&#8217;s complete vision concerning His building more clearly.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Vision of God's Building &nbsp; pg 17</div><br></body></html>
