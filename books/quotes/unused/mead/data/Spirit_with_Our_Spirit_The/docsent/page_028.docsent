   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. The Seven Spirits 1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Sevenfold Intensified Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The book of Revelation reveals the seven Spirits as the sevenfold intensified Spirit for the church's degradation in the dark age.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even by the end of the first century, the church had become degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The apostles Paul, Peter, and John all dealt with this degradation in their writings particularly in 2 Timothy, 2 Peter, and the three Epistles of John.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the end of the first century, the degradation of the church began and has continued until today.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Throughout the past nineteen centuries, God has been carrying out His economy; on the other hand, Satan has been carrying out his chaos.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We published a book on this subject entitled The Satanic Chaos in the Old Creation and the Divine Economy for the New Creation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The satanic chaos and the divine economy go together.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Eventually, the satanic chaos will be done away with in the lake of fire, and the divine economy will consummate in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the universe there are both day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When you see the church in the day, in a wonderful state, you should be ready to take the night.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But when you are in the night, do not be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Soon the day will come.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because of the degradation in the dark age, God has intensified His Spirit sevenfold.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the Lord was on this earth for thirty-three and a half years, He did everything by the Spirit, but the Spirit was still just one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With the early apostles at the time of Pentecost, the Spirit was also one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But in the age of Revelation, the Spirit has been intensified sevenfold.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Such an intensified Spirit is for us to be vitalized, to be the overcomers in the degradation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the end of the first century, it was not easy to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today with us it is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this dark age we need the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many Christians appreciate what is recorded in the four Gospels and the Acts at Peter's time, but they should appreciate even more what we have today.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today what we experience is the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In order to be the overcomers, we need such a Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The book of Revelation is a book concerning the overcomers, and the overcomers are the martyrs.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Revelation 12 the man-child is a composition of all the overcoming martyrs beginning from Abel v. 5 . Then all the overcomers standing on the glassy sea in Revelation 15 were martyred by Antichrist during the three and a half years of the great tribulation v. 2 . The overcomers recorded in Revelation are martyrs to God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They lived as martyrs by the sevenfold Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>During the Boxer Rebellion in China, there were a number of Christians who were martyred for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One brother who was a young businessman in the old capital of Peking told me a story of one young person who was martyred there.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One day the Boxers were parading and shouting in the street.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All the stores had closed their doors, and he was within his store observing them through a crack in the door.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He saw a young girl in their midst singing and praising while being led to her execution by the Boxers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was amazed that such a young girl would not be afraid in such a terrifying situation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He resolved to find out what made this young woman so courageous.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because of this, he was saved by the Lord and became a preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Later he came to my hometown and told me this story.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How could such a young girl be that strong?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She could be that strong only by the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In order to be today's overcoming martyrs, we need to experience this Spirit.</S>
