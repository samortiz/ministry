   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>INTRODUCTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This book is a reprint of two booklets written by Witness Lee more than fifteen years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They were published in response to the criticism of a few concerning his teachings on the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first one, The Revelation of the Triune God according to the Pure Word of the Bible, was released in 1976.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is a statement of his scriptural stand on this issue.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In his statement Witness Lee cites several reputable authorities including Andrew Murray, Griffith Thomas, and J. Oswald Sanders.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The second booklet, What a Heresy Two Divine Fathers, Two Life-giving Spirits, and Three Gods! was published the following year.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This work challenged the heretical standing held by his critics and exposed their twisting of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These booklets were evidently ignored by the authors of The New Cults, who reprinted their same accusations in subsequent publications.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A number of their publications are still being circulated today by the Christian Research Institute CRI and others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is for this reason that we are compelled to republish these clear statements by Witness Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is a shame that writing done in the name of Christian research would deny the author's plain words!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These booklets remain a clear refutation of the critics' accusations and underline their reckless disregard for the truth of their publications.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Best of all, they will help the seeker to examine the truth for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the first booklet Brother Lee gave a balanced scriptural definition of the Triune God by citing the Bible's own words.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He then identified the real point of contention that all Three of the Triune God are one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One of the critics, Walter Martin, frustrated by his traditional understanding, considered this "confusing of the persons of the Trinity."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Yet by reading this booklet anyone can see for himself what the Bible plainly says.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord told the Pharisees, "You have deprived the word of God of its authority because of your tradition" Matt 15:6b .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>May we not make that same mistake today!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the second booklet Brother Lee focused upon the problems caused by forcing Scripture into traditional understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The result of denying the scriptural oneness of the Three of the Trinity issues in several heresies!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Witness Lee examined in detail the crucial passages of Scripture such as Isaiah 9:6, 1 Corinthians 15:45, and 2 Corinthians 3:17.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He exposed the twisting of the verses by his critics and charged them with heretical results.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He boldly issued a challenge, "Let us wait and see how they can clear themselves from this charge."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Cal Beisner, another of the critical authors, later attempted to deny the clear context of 2 Corinthians 3:17 by saying that "the Lord" there is not Jesus, even though seven verses later Paul writes that we preach "Christ Jesus as Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To date, none of the critics have issued one effectual argument to clear themselves of Witness Lee's charge of heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Another strong point of these booklets is the realization that God is triune, not just for doctrine, but that we could experience Him for the fulfilling of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Brother Lee concluded the first booklet, "The Triune God cannot be fully comprehended as a doctrinal matter by our limited mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Triune God is for our experience and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God as a Trinity is for His economy, that is, for the dispensing of Himself into us to be our life and our everything."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This truth seems to have escaped the tradition-bound understanding of his critics.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>May the Lord use these words with more effect upon each reader of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Dan Towle</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Anaheim, California February 1994</S>
