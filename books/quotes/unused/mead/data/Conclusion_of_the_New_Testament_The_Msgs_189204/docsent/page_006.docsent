   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED NINETY THE CHURCH THE HIDDEN MYSTERY IN GOD'S ETERNAL ECONOMY 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The church is the hidden mystery in God's eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous message we considered God's eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we come to the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>B. The Mystery of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The mystery of the universe is God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The mystery of God, the New Testament reveals, is Christ Col 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The mystery of Christ is the church Eph 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Actually these are simply three stages of one mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God is to be found in Christ, and Christ is to be found in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church, then, is the mystery of Christ, who in turn is the mystery of God, who Himself is the mystery of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Ephesians 3:4 Paul speaks of the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The mystery of God in Colossians 2:2 is Christ, whereas the mystery of Christ in Ephesians 3:4 is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God is a mystery, and Christ, as the embodiment of God to express Him, is the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ is also a mystery, and the church, as the Body of Christ to express Him, is the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to Ephesians 3:4, the church has a particular title the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we consider Ephesians 3:4 in context, we see that the mystery of Christ is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, Christ is the mystery of God, and the church is the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God is a mystery, Christ is the mystery of God, and the church is the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, the church is actually a mystery within a mystery, for the church is a mystery in the third stage.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first stage is God Himself as the mystery of the universe; the second stage is Christ as the mystery of God; and the third stage is the church as the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In God's economy revealed in the New Testament there are mainly two mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first mystery, revealed in the book of Colossians, is Christ as the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Colossians 2:2 Paul speaks of the "full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ is God's mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Himself God is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is real, living, and almighty; however, He is invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because no one has ever seen God, He is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This mysterious God is embodied in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, Christ is the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ is not only God, but He is God embodied, God defined, God explained, and God expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, Christ is God made visible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord Jesus said, "He who has seen Me has seen the Father" John 14:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The first mystery in God's economy is Christ, God expressed, as the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The second mystery, revealed in the book of Ephesians and explained in it, especially in chapter three, is the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ also is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Ephesians 3:4 Paul uses the expression "the mystery of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Furthermore, Colossians 1:27 says, "To whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As believers, we have Christ dwelling in us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But this Christ whom we have is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although Christ lives in us, worldly people do not realize that He is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To them, this is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But although Christ is mysterious, the church is the manifestation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As the Body of Christ, the church is the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we see the church, we see Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we come into the church, we come into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we contact the church, we contact Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The church is truly the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As a mystery, the church is in the Triune God, in the Father, in the Son, and in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>With the believers there is an amount of mystery, but not as much as with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The divine mystery is much more with the church corporately than with the believers individually.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church is a corporate unit produced out of Christ, who is the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This all-inclusive Christ is the mystery of the mysterious God, and such a Christ as the mystery of God produces a unit which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>By this we can realize that the church is the continuation of the mystery which is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Mystery surely produces mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christ, who is the mystery of God, brings forth the church, the mystery of Christ.</S>
