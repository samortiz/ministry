   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE STREAM OF THE WORK OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This stream is also the stream of God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Where the stream flows, there is the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is clear in the book of Acts, a book which speaks to us of the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What is that kind of work which is the work of God?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is a work in the stream of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Where the stream of living water flows, there is the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God works along the flowing of the stream of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you consider the whole record of the book of Acts, you will see the picture quite clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the day of Pentecost this stream of divine life flowed out of God Himself in Christ with ruling power from the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It began to flow from Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From there it flowed to Antioch, and then from Antioch it turned to the West; it flowed to Asia, and through Asia it flowed to Macedonia, to Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here is a picture of the flowing of the stream of divine life, and with the flowing of this stream is the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By flowing God works; by flowing God preaches His Gospel; by flowing God brings people to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is a stream which we could call the stream or the current of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Where it flows, there is the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Notice that there is no end, no conclusion, to the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There are twenty-eight chapters, but in the book of Acts in heaven today there may be twenty-eight hundred chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The twenty-eight chapters in our Bible are just the record of sixty or seventy years of history.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is an opening, but no closing, no conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is because this stream of life is still flowing and never stops flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The history of the church shows that this stream has continued to flow from generation to generation right up to this very day, and it is flowing still.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Where it flows, there is the life of God; where it flows, there is the fellowship of the Body; where it flows, there is the testimony of Jesus; and where it flows, there is also the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is the stream of life, the stream of fellowship, the stream of testimony, and the stream of the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brothers and sisters, we must be in this stream.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we are not in this stream, we are out of life, we are out of the fellowship of the Body, we are out of the testimony of the Lord Jesus, and we are out of the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Oh, if we are simply in this stream, we will have everything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>From whence does it flow?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It flows from the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What kind of a throne is this?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is the throne of the Lamb with God in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God is in the Lamb, and the Lamb is on the throne, and this stream flows out of this throne.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you have this stream, you have the throne, you have the Lamb and you have God within the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you have this stream you have everything.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you are in this stream, then you are in God, you are in the Lamb with the throne, you are in the life, you are in the fellowship, you are in the testimony, and you are in the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Are you in the stream?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You need to know.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you are not in the stream, you will have to make a turn; you will have to have a crisis.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must be in the stream!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the universe there is a divine stream which starts in the beginning of the Scriptures and flows throughout the whole Book.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We can trace this stream from the beginning of the Bible right to the end. In many places there is reference to this flowing stream.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is still flowing today.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is flowing, flowing all the time, and will be flowing to eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord said that the water He gives would be a well of water springing up unto eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This stream shall flow to eternity; it can never and will never cease.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Throughout the whole history of the Church there has ever been and still is such a divine stream.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This stream has flowed back to the Western world as a supply to His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We look to the Lord that it will be increasing in this country and even to all parts of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>May we remember this in our prayers, and may we be ready to go along with the Lord that this stream may have a free way to flow without any hindrance in us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must be faithful to the flowing of this stream of the divine life, of the fellowship of the Body, of the testimony of the Lord Jesus, and of the work of God.</S>
