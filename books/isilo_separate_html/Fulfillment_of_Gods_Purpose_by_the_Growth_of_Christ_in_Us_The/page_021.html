He will urge you to call more on His name, to praise Him more, and to speak for Him more. If you are talkative, the Lord will say, "Be quiet." The Lord would not allow you to talk. He would save you from being talkative. This is the Lord's salvation. I like to see the Canadians shouting praises, but I do not like to see the Mexicans shouting so much. We need to be saved in His life. By our life we live in a natural way, but by His life we live in a way which is absolutely versus our nature. I encourage you to go to the Lord and see what He would say to you. We need to go along with Christ as life within us. When the Canadians are excited, they will have the growth of life, but when the Mexicans shout too much, they will not gain the increase of life. We all need to be saved, not by outward doing, but by the inward life, by Christ as life. Christ is going to live within us another life versus our natural life.</P><P>Now you may wonder what you should do. You should simply go along with the inner life. Life saves. You need to be saved from every item of your natural being. If you are faithful and mean business with the Lord, the more you say, "O Lord" to take in the Lord, the more you will be saved from what you are. You will be saved from your being and from your behavior. Then you will know how to behave yourself, not according to your life, but according to Christ as your life within you.</P><P>We will eventually be saved to such an extent that we will become the highest people in life. As those who are for the Lord's testimony, for the Lord's recovery, and for the local church, we need the highest manner of life in our offices, our schools, and our neighborhoods. We need the highest behavior, not by our own doing, but by Christ as life. We will convince people not just by our shouting, our praising, our singing, or our calling, but by having our being on the highest plane.</P><P>You have to convince people not just by what you say or by what you claim to be, but by your being, by your saved behavior. Your being on the highest plane will cause people to look up to you. You will be on the highest plane because you are being saved by Christ being your life. You are living by Christ, the highest life. If we are like this, the Lord has a way to move on, and nothing can prevail against the Lord's way. So we look to the Lord for His saving by His life. We all need to declare: "Much more we will be saved in His life!"</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> </body></html>
