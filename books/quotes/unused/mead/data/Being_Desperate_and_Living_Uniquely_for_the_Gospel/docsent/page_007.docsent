   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One leading brother told me that he did not bring anyone to the Lord for twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, after he began to practice door-knocking in the new way, he baptized seventeen within four months.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>My burden is to wake you up because you have been drugged.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord says that as a branch, you have to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is serious.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you do not bear fruit, there is the danger that you will be cut off John 15:2, 6 .</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God even took away His kingdom from Israel because Israel was barren, fruitless, and gave His kingdom to another people, the church Matt 21:43; Luke 13:6-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But how about today's church?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Who is bearing fruit?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thirty-eight years ago, when I left mainland China, there were a little over three million Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then the Communists took over the country, and they tore down Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The organizations were closed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since 1970, the Lord began to use the young men born under communism.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many of them were in their twenties.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They picked up the gospel which we and other Christians had sown there, and they became prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I checked with some experts who researched the Christians' situation on mainland China, and I asked how many Christians there are today in mainland China.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Protestants have only increased by about nine million over twenty years since 1964, but within about fifteen years, the increase in mainland China has been about forty-seven million.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A good number of these are taking the way of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Who did this?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There were no chapels, cathedrals, ministers, or pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The gospel was preached mostly by pure Christian young people with no clergy, no hierarchy, and no organization.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, all the clergy, hierarchy, and organization needs to be torn down.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do you not think we have clergy?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do you not think we have hierarchy?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We do not call anyone a pastor, but actually we have "pastors."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have followed Christianity's way unconsciously.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We brought people in and we killed their function by our way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We say we do not control, but in many respects we do control.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The leading ones need to ask themselves if they are part of the clergy and the hierarchy among us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Let us all drop the old way, "the old coat!"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I am not only telling the elders to drop "the old coat."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All of the older generation must give up the taste of the old way and take the new taste of the new way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For the Lord's sake, we need to take the new taste.</S>
