<p>We also need to realize that the corporate leading in the work does not completely annul the Lord&rsquo;s personal leading. For example, when the serving ones seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading together, they may feel that a certain brother should go to Hualien, and, having the same feeling as the Body, he may go. If, after arriving in Hualien and praying, he feels to hold an eight-day gospel meeting, he does not need to check with us about this. This does not mean that he is acting individualistically; rather, he is being led personally, according to our corporate leading. Thus, the matter of personal leading is not annulled in the move of the work. As long as the brother is led by the Holy Spirit when he arrives in Hualien, he does not need to check with someone about every detail of the work. Sometimes it is not even possible to check with others. Can we even say that someone has the &ldquo;higher&rdquo; authority to answer his question? If a Christian mission work sent two missionaries to Hualien, their every action would first have to be reported to the mission board, but this would not make their actions to be according to the Lord&rsquo;s leading.</p>
<p>When Paul and Silas were led to go out, the brothers corporately sent them forward and commended them to the grace of the Lord (15:40). When they arrived in Asia, however, the Holy Spirit forbade them to stay (16:6). At this point, they did not say, &ldquo;The forbidding of the Holy Spirit is insufficient. We should write to the brothers in Antioch to see whether or not we should leave Asia.&rdquo; This would have been wrong. In the work&rsquo;s move, there should be the freedom for the personal leading of the Spirit. When Paul and Silas left Asia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but again the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them. As a result, they went west to Troas (vv. 7-8) in the direction of the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s leading and in the direction that corresponded to the allowance of the Spirit of Jesus. At this point, &ldquo;a vision appeared to Paul during the night: A certain man, a Macedonian, was standing and entreating him and saying, &lsquo;Come over into Macedonia and help us&rsquo;&rdquo; (v. 9). Then they became clear, and the gospel was spread to Europe.</p>
<p>In the fellowship among the local churches today, all the local churches, large or small, have equal standing before God. Even though some large local churches may be more experienced and may have been blessed more, they can only take the position of supporting the smaller churches, not of governing them.</p>
<p>We need to be clear that our oneness is in fellowship, not in organizational hierarchy. The church has no headquarters or even branches. Some saints seem to feel that the church in Taipei is the &ldquo;headquarters.&rdquo; This is a delusion that, in part, is based on the fact that the co-workers often gather together in Taipei. For example, sometimes the co-working brothers and sisters come together for the sake of the work, which is not a matter related to the church in Taipei. Taipei is used only because it is convenient. However, when we call a co-workers&rsquo; meeting in Taipei, we often include the brothers from the church in Taipei in order to take care of them, but the saints should not think that this means that Taipei is our &ldquo;headquarters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, this also does not mean that we can forsake the fellowship in the Body. If a small local church says, &ldquo;We do not need to consult with the brothers from other local churches because our standing is the same as theirs,&rdquo; we cannot say that this is wrong, but it is not sweet. The deeper the fellowship among us is, the better. Churches in various localities should stand before the Lord but also humbly consult with other churches to receive support and leading. If a co-worker who is led to a certain place can only tell others who his &ldquo;boss&rdquo; is, this is wrong. Nevertheless, it is good for him to learn to fellowship with other co-workers concerning his work so that he can receive a corporate confirmation.</p>
<p>In our going out to propagate the Lord&rsquo;s work, we need to be corporately led by the Lord in our service, yet we should learn to receive the Lord&rsquo;s personal leading. We must be like Paul and Silas, who accepted the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s forbidding and disallowing. Every worker of the Lord must learn this lesson as well as the lesson of fellowshipping with the local saints.</p>
<p>We have no organization; we only have the leading to serve the Lord together in the church. If we leave one local church, we still need to be led by the Lord in another locality. We do not have organizational relationships, but we should have fellowship in all things at all times and in all places. In Taipei the co-workers should have fellowship with the brothers in Taipei, and in Hualien the co-workers should have fellowship with the brothers in Hualien.</p>
<p>Forgive me for saying that the Western missionaries made a great mistake in their preaching of the gospel in China. They had the thought that the Chinese were too immature, and thus they did not fellowship with the Chinese saints. Instead, they checked with their mission boards in everything. According to the truth, after preaching the gospel in China and raising up native believers to serve the Lord, the missionaries should have sought the leading of the Lord with these brothers and sisters to determine how the work should be done. Similarly, we must fellowship with the saints in Taichung if we work in Taichung, and in fellowship we should look to the Lord concerning how to carry out His work in Taichung. We should not say, &ldquo;We have been sent by the brothers. You are immature, so we will not include you in our fellowship.&rdquo; This forsakes fellowship and upholds organization. There is no organization among us; there is only the fellowship that comes through serving the Lord together. We should fellowship at all times and in all places with the brothers and sisters who are with us according to the Lord&rsquo;s arrangement.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Vision, Ministry, and Leading of the Lord's Serving Ones &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
