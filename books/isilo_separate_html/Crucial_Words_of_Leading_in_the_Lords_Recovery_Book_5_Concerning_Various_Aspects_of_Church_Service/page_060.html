OF READING THE LIFE-STUDIES</h2>
<p>Whether a meeting is good or bad is not determined by a method but by whether we enjoy the Lord. After each meeting we must ask ourselves whether the Lord&rsquo;s word was opened to us and whether we touched the riches in His word. If the Lord&rsquo;s word was not opened to us and we did not touch the riches in His word, then we need to reconsider what profits us. We should use these two points as our criteria when we review our meetings.</p>
<p>Brother Lee has given us seven ways to read the Life-studies in a small group: reading a short portion, reading with expression, reading with emphasis, reading in a living way, reading with explanation, reading with prayer, and reading with songs. Everyone in the small group should read a short portion. When we read a long portion, it is difficult for others to join in. We should also repeat any crucial phrase or sentence. Even if someone has already read it, we can read it again, and the whole group can repeat it together. If someone feels that a certain phrase is important, he can read it with emphasis. This calls everyone&rsquo;s attention to the phrase. To read with emphasis is to deepen and strengthen our feeling toward the text. One person may emphasize one phrase, and another may emphasize a different phrase. When all the phrases are put together, the message becomes very rich.</p>
<p>We can also read the message in a living way. Reading in a living way requires the person who reads to be living. To read in a living way is to read with much expression so that others touch the Lord&rsquo;s living word. To read with explanation is to explain the meaning of the text so that others may understand. To read with prayer is to turn the text we read into prayer, and to read with songs is to use the crucial words to compose a song or to use a familiar tune to sing the words. This deepens our impression. It is easier to remember the text if we sing it a few times. Initially, these seven ways of reading the Life-studies may not feel spontaneous to us, but because there are few people in a group, if we practice, we can enjoy the riches in the word.</p>

<h2 class="head1">AVOIDING SEVEN THINGS<br />
WHILE READING THE LIFE-STUDIES</h2>
<p>In addition to paying attention to the development of the small groups so that they become the key to spreading and transmitting the truth, there are also seven things that all the saints should exercise to avoid.</p>
<p>First, we should not wait for someone to read. Rather than just beginning and joining in, we often wait for someone else to read, but they are waiting for someone else to read as well. When no one speaks, the small group cannot move. Therefore, we should not wait for one another.</p>
<p>Second, we should not attack others. In our reading we should not emphasize a phrase in a way that attacks others. Doing this embarrasses others, and they will not come the next time.</p>
<p>Third, we should not trouble others. It is difficult for some people to open their mouths due to their disposition. We should not force them to speak. This will trouble them, and they may not want to come again.</p>
<p>Fourth, we should not argue over terms. Some people like to ask questions and are even insistent. We should not engage in any argument with them. When a small group meeting enters into an argument, the spirit leaves. If a person asks a question that is bound to arouse an argument, instead of replying, it is best to smile and to refocus on the subject. We should also indicate our willingness to speak with him at a later time to respond to his question.</p>
<p>Fifth, we should not lecture and give orders. We should never use strong words as a stick to beat others or criticize them. For example, there may be a sentence in the message about Christianity or Catholicism. We should read it without using it as a pretext to criticize others.</p>
<p>Sixth, we should not do everything by ourselves. Some of us may feel so burdened that we read the Life-study message in all seven ways by ourselves. This hinders and even robs others of the opportunity to function.</p>
<p>Seventh, we should not be inflexible. We do not have to use a song to begin every meeting. To do so is to be inflexible.</p>
<p>As a conclusion, do not wait for each other, do not attack others, do not cause others trouble, do not argue over terms, do not lecture or give orders, do not do everything by yourself, and do not be inflexible. We should try our best to avoid these points in our practice of the small groups.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PAYING ATTENTION TO SEVEN POSITIVE PRACTICES</h2>
<p>After looking at seven things that we should avoid, we should now look at seven positive factors. First, we need to recognize the operation of the Holy Spirit. If we desire to read the message and bring it to life in the small group, we must recognize the operation of the Holy Spirit in the meeting. We need to know what the Holy Spirit has touched through the reading and then follow the leading of the Holy Spirit to speak. Even though we need to read from the message, we should be flexible and not rigid. In short, our spirit must be living, and we must recognize the operation of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Second, we need to be keen to sense others&rsquo; reactions. We should be able to tell from a person&rsquo;s facial expression whether he understands what he is reading. If we see that a person&rsquo;s expression or eyes indicate that he is confused, we need to explain the reading. Do not be afraid to do this. We must minister the word to others.</p>
<p>Third, we must learn to be flexible in using the hymns. Hymns are the best way to open people&rsquo;s hearts. We must also be flexible in selecting a hymn. There is no need to sing from the beginning to the end of a hymn, nor is it good to sing only stanza 1. We can select two or three stanzas according to the situation of the meeting. The new ones may not understand many terms in the hymns, so we need to explain the terms so that the new ones can understand and thus enter into the feeling of the hymn.</p>
<p>Fourth, we must pay attention to the actual needs of others. If we know that a brother in our small group is feeling down, we should pay attention to his reaction to the message and care for his inward need. At an appropriate time we should expound the reading to meet his real situation. In this way he will receive the help to deal with his circumstances. All the words in the Life-studies are able to meet our practical needs.</p>
<p>Fifth, we should apply God&rsquo;s word appropriately. All the words in the Life-studies come from the Bible. Hence, we should learn to bring people, especially the new ones, back to the Bible, to the Lord&rsquo;s word. We need to lead the new ones to find the appropriate verses in the Bible and to read the verses so that they realize the source of the words in the Life-studies.</p>
<p>Sixth, we should give testimonies from our experience. We should not be rigid when we apply God&rsquo;s word and use it in a living way. We should avoid abstract talk and give practical testimonies. Suppose we speak concerning the Son of God&mdash;a living person. To explain how He is a living person to us and how we can experience Him as a living Lord in our daily life require that we share our practical experiences. Then we can minister the word to others in a fresh way. As much as possible, we should give testimonies from our experience and not speak in the way of preaching.</p>
<p>Seventh, we should encourage the new ones to open their mouths. We must not make it difficult for them, but we must encourage them to speak. To open one&rsquo;s mouth does not necessarily mean that he should be loud when he releases his spirit. In a small group there may be some believers who have not met for over twenty years and some gospel friends who have been to only a few meetings. They might not be loud when they release their spirit. In principle, in every small group meeting we should make sure that everyone opens his mouth at least once. If a person finds it hard to open his mouth, someone can read with him. We can ask, &ldquo;Is it okay for us to read this section together?&rdquo; Once he opens his mouth, it will influence him. He will have a sense of participating in the meeting, which is totally different from what he would feel if he had never opened his mouth.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the seven positive practices include recognizing the operation of the Holy Spirit, being keen to sense others&rsquo; reactions, being flexible in using the hymns in a living way, paying attention to the actual needs of others, applying God&rsquo;s word appropriately, giving testimonies from our experience, and encouraging the new ones to open their mouth. These items are a matter of practice and skill. We should not be casual and careless in the meeting. In every meeting we need to strike the crucial points, and we need to work the riches into others.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_059.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_061.html">Next</a> </body></html>
