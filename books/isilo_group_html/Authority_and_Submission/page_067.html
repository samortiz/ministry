All the brothers have to submit to the elders. Titus 1 speaks of basic qualifications of an elder-self-control and submission. A lawless person can never execute the law, and a rebellious person can never make others submissive. An elder must exercise strict self-control. A common trait among many people is the lack of discipline. Hence, in appointing elders, we have to select those who are particularly exercised in self-control. God appoints the elders to manage the church. As such, they must be submissive and must exercise self-control. They must set their hearts to be a pattern to all in everything. God never appoints a person who loves to be the first among others (like Diotrephes) to be an elder. The elders are the highest deputy authority in a local church. For this reason they must be men with self-control.<p>First Timothy 3:4-5 speaks of another basic qualification of an elder-he must be able to manage his own house. Managing one&#8217;s house does not refer to managing one&#8217;s parents or wife, but it refers mainly to managing one&#8217;s children. An elder has to teach his children to walk soberly and to be obedient in all things. A man must first be a good father before he can be an elder. He must first be an authority at home before he can be an elder in the church.<p>An elder must not be an arrogant person. If a person becomes proud as soon as he assumes authority, he is not qualified to be an elder. An elder in a local church should feel as if he has no authority at all. If an elder is always conscious of his authority, he is not qualified to be an elder or to handle the affairs of the church. Only the foolish and the narrow-minded are proud. Such ones cannot stand the temptation of God&#8217;s glory, and they cannot bear God&#8217;s commission and assignment. Once such ones are entrusted with something, they fall into a snare. This is why a new convert cannot be an overseer (1 Tim. 3:6-in Greek this word means a novice in a trade. For example, among carpenters there are masters who have been in the trade for decades, and there are novices who have barely learned to handle a hammer.), lest he be blinded with pride and fall into the judgment suffered by the devil.<h2 class=head2>Concerning the Lord&#8217;s Workers</h2><p>Titus 2:15 describes the requirements of a deputy authority in the Lord&#8217;s work. Titus was not an elder in the church, but a worker of the Lord, serving in the capacity of an apostle. Paul charged Titus to exhort men. He should not only speak in public but also exhort men one by one. He should convict men with all authority. At the same time, he should not let others despise him in words and deeds. In order for others not to despise us, we have to sanctify ourselves. If we are the same as others in many things, and if we are loose, careless, and unchecked in our daily life, others will despise us. We must not be indulgent in anything. Only then will others respect us and honor us as an authority and a representative of God. This is what Paul told Timothy (1 Tim. 4:12). Although a worker should not seek after human glory or honor, he should neither be despised to the point of losing his sanctified stature.<p>In the entire New Testament, Paul wrote only two books which were directed toward young co-workers. They are 1 Timothy and Titus. In these two books Paul often said that a worker should not dishonor himself but should be a pattern in everything. Anything that leads to contempt should be avoided; one should refuse such things. There is a price to pay in being an authority. One has to separate himself from others. He has to be able to live alone. A pattern must be different from others; he must sanctify himself. If he is the same as the others, he is no longer a pattern. We should not uplift ourselves, but at the same time we should not make others despise us. We should always sanctify ourselves and should not jest lightly. We have to learn to separate ourselves in the Lord. A worker should not be arrogant, but neither should he give reason for others to despise him. Once a worker becomes too common, he is disqualified from his work. Once he becomes too common, his usefulness is gone, and his authority is lost.<p>A worker must also keep his standing and maintain God&#8217;s authority. Authority manifests itself in separation and distinction. The main thing about a representative authority is that he represents God, and being an authority has everything to do with being a pattern. This is a very serious matter. A deputy authority is one who &#8220;represents&#8221; authority, not one who &#8220;exercises&#8221; authority.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_066.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_068.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Authority and Submission &nbsp; pg 67</div><br></body></html>
