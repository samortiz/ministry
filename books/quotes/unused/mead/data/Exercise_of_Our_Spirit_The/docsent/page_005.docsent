   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Our Need to Have a Pure Conscience</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The conscience is the leading part of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to have a good conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When our conscience condemns us, we are unable to exercise our spirit properly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must also have a pure conscience 3:9; 2 Tim 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our conscience may be good because it is cleansed from anything sinful, dirty, or evil, but it may not be pure because of our self-seeking motive.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A pure conscience is a conscience that is within a heart that cares for nothing but God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As we pointed out in the previous message, a brother may be very good; morally there may be nothing wrong with him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From another angle, however, he may not be pure.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His conscience is good, but it is not pure because he is not for God alone but also for something else, such as the mission field, a congregation, a position, or his own glory, honor, and respect.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is nothing morally wrong with his work, but he has no purity because of his many motives.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Without a pure conscience, a conscience that is absolutely for God, it is difficult to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order to serve God, we must have a pure conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 2 Timothy 1:3 Paul said, I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers in a pure conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For Paul to say this meant that he was seeking only God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need this kind of a pure conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A Pure Heart Being a Mind, Emotion, and Will That Are Singly for the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First Timothy 1:5 also speaks of a pure heart.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The heart is a composition of the mind, emotion, will, and conscience Matt 9:4; Heb 4:12; John 16:22, 6; Acts 11:23; Heb 10:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that our mind, emotion, will, and conscience must be pure.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every part of our being needs to be pure.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many Christians today like to study the Bible according to its doctrinal teachings, but they have many differing opinions and concepts concerning these teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This indicates that their mind, emotion, and will are not pure; that is, they do not have a pure heart.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since their heart is not pure, their conscience also is not pure.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In order to have a pure conscience, we must have a pure mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A pure heart is a heart that is single and simple for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that our mind considers nothing but the Lord, our emotion loves nothing but Him, and our will chooses only Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In our mind, emotion, and will we are for nothing but the Lord and seek only Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is to have a pure heart and a pure conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Is our mind fully and wholly for God?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Does our emotion simply and fully love the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Is our will wholly for God?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we check with ourselves, we will admit that we are not pure.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In our mind there is much traffic in many directions.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Likewise, in our emotion we love the Lord, but we also love many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Similarly, our will may be for the Lord in the morning, but at noon it will be for something else, and in the evening it may be for yet another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that we are not pure in our mind, emotion, and will; that is, we do not have a pure heart.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A Pure Conscience Being Vital</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>for the Exercise of Our Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When all our inward parts are pure, our heart is pure and our conscience is also pure.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A pure conscience is vital for the exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If our conscience is not good, if there is condemnation in our conscience, our spirit will be deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we have condemnation, then regardless how much people encourage us to exercise our spirit, we will be unable to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, we may have a good conscience but not a pure one, so once again our spirit is unable to be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Within our conscience there may be the testimony that we are not pure and single for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What we are seeking is not evil, but it is not the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This kind of condemnation is not rough and coarse but deep, fine, and tender, pointing out to us that we are not fully and purely for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even this kind of condemnation weakens our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We may tell others that we are right, but we cannot tell this to our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The more we argue that we are right, the more troubling we will have in our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The wise way is not to argue with our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need to be pure in all our inward parts in our conscience, heart, mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we deal with these inward parts, we will have a pure conscience in a pure heart with a pure will, pure emotion, and pure mind.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then we will be able to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Otherwise, it will be difficult to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To exercise our spirit requires a preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must have a spirit of power in our will, of love in our emotion, and of soberness and soundness in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>These three inward parts must be under the control of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then our heart will be pure, and our conscience will be transparent and crystal clear.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It will be easy for us to exercise our spirit, and there will be a free way for our spirit to be released.</S>
