<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE PROPHECY CONCERNING ISRAEL'S<br>DESTINY IN THE GREAT WAR OF ARMAGEDDON,<br>IN THEIR HOUSEHOLD SALVATION,<br>AND IN THE MILLENNIUM</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. In the Great War of Armageddon</H2><P>Chapters twelve and fourteen show us many aspects of Israel's destiny in the great war of Armageddon.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Greatest War among Mankind</H2><P>The war of Armageddon will be the greatest war among mankind. It will terminate human government on earth at the end of the coming great tribulation, in the short period of time that will consummate the present age.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. A War at the End of the Great Tribulation</H2><P>This war will take place at the end of the great tribulation of three and a half years (Matt. 24:21; Dan. 7:25; 12:7; Rev. 11:2; 13:5).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. A War Motivated by Antichrist</H2><P>The war of Armageddon will be a war motivated by Antichrist to destroy Israel (Rev. 16:12-16; 9:13-16; 19:19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. A War Waged by Satan<br>through His Human Followers</H2><P>Although this war will be motivated by Antichrist, it will be waged by Satan through his human followers against God with His saints (Rev. 16:13-14; 17:14; 19:14; Zech. 14:5b). Satan has his followers, and God has His saints. For thousands of years, Satan has been exercising his devices to gain people for his army. God has also been working to prepare His chosen ones to be His army. Eventually, at the great war of Armageddon, there will be two armies&#151;Satan's earthly army and God's heavenly army.</P>
