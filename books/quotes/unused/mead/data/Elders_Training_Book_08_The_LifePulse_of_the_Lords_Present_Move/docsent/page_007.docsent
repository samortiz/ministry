   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEW TESTAMENT WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING IN THE PRINCIPLE OF INCARNATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must also realize that the New Testament way is in the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Do you believe that they spoke in tongues in the home meetings in every house, from house to house?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Did they speak in tongues only on the big occasions?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No doubt, they spoke in tongues before a big congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Acts 2 tells us that the many visitors from different countries heard some of the one hundred twenty speaking in tongues on the day of Pentecost vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>4, 6, 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They did speak in tongues before a big congregation, but there is no hint in the Word that they also spoke in tongues in the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>My point is this: in a big congregation, God borrowed the works of power of the coming age Heb 6:5 as evidence that what the apostles preached and ministered and how they acted were absolutely of God, not of man Heb 2:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God does not have any intention to do that much in a miraculous way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the New Testament God s doing is always in the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord Jesus lived on this earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When He was a carpenter, do you believe He performed miracles?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do you believe that He did not do any carpentry?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When Joseph asked Him to make a table, did He miraculously cause a table to appear?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must realize that God lived there in a man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I believe that Jesus did not do anything miraculous in those thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the three and a half years of His ministry, He occasionally did something miraculously, but I do not believe that He performed a miracle every day and everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the New Testament, God s move is always in the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Incarnation is not only that God mingles Himself with man, but also that God hides Himself within man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>During this 1986 elders training, the Lord has done a great deal, but it has all been done in a hidden way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Throughout church history, how much has really been done by the Lord miraculously?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the Bible translators could have translated all the Bibles miraculously, there would have been no need of any labor.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the Lord s move went to a certain country, was there a miracle performed to produce a new translation of the Bible instantaneously?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If that were the case, there would be no need for Bible translators.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But consider the tremendous amount of labor of the translators of the Bible to collect and train people to learn the foreign languages.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Spanish people could have asked the Bible translators, Where is your God?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Isn t your God almighty, omnipotent, and able to do everything?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Why wouldn t you fast and pray for three hours to get a version of the Bible in Spanish?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is superstitious.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many educated people become so superstitious in the matter of speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They resort to the human manufacturing of speaking in tongues to fulfill their superstition.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>PETER S MESSAGE ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the day of Pentecost three thousand one hundred and twenty believers began to meet from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I must believe that there was no tongue-speaking in those houses.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Probably they mainly taught that one message given by Peter on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To us Peter s message in Acts 2 may be quite familiar, but it was surely a shock to those three thousand new converts.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Peter s message, God s New Testament economy can be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord s incarnation, His living in humanity on this earth, His death and burial, His going into Hades, His resurrection, and His ascension are the points of Peter s message Acts 2:22-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Peter quoted Psalm 16 which says, You will not leave my soul in Hades, nor will You permit Your Holy One to see corruption Acts 2:27; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Psa 16:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Peter told people that while Jesus was buried, He went to Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then He came out of Hades and His body came out of the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What a description of the Lord s death and burial and what an interpretation of the Lord s resurrection!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It was prophesied in the Old Testament, but those blinded Jewish teachers never saw this light.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But on the day of Pentecost Peter saw this.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He also talked about the Lord s ascension when he said that God has made Him both Lord and Christ this Jesus whom you crucified v. 36 . Peter told the Jews that God exalted Jesus and uplifted Him to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the heavens He received the consummated Spirit and poured Himself out as the Spirit upon the hundred and twenty v. 33 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Peter was wonderful on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He knew how to quote Joel 2, but he quoted too much.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In Acts 2:19-20, Peter quoted from the book of Joel that God would show wonders and signs, but none of these wonders happened on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Joel 2 needs two fulfillments one at the beginning of the New Testament age and another at the end of the New Testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The fulfillment of Joel begins and ends the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The ending of the New Testament age is also prophesied in Zechariah 12.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At that time the Lord Jesus will come down from the air to rescue the Jews from Antichrist s persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Spirit is poured out again and they all repent.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Zechariah 12:10 says that God will pour out upon the house of David the spirit of grace and of supplications.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>That is a fulfillment of the pouring out of the Spirit in Joel the second time.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Peter also did not forget to quote that wonderful verse in Joel that says, And it shall be that everyone, whoever calls on the name of the Lord, shall be saved Acts 2:21; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Joel 2:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What a message Peter gave on the day of Pentecost!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Most Christians take Acts 2 for granted, but I believe that on the day of Pentecost all those new converts, after listening to this message, were talking about it constantly.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They probably had no heart to do anything except come together to have a gathering in every house to talk about this message.</S>
