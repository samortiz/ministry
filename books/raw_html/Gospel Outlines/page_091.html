<h1 class="title">THE WOMAN SEEKING THE LOST COIN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Luke 15:8-10</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Men are God&rsquo;s property
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Men are created by God; therefore, naturally, men belong to God.</li>
	<li>God considers men as His property, as His treasure, just like the woman who considers the ten pieces of silver as treasure.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Men are lost
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Men are born lost. To be lost is to be separated from the original owner. If you do not know to whom you belong, that is a proof in itself that you are lost.</li>
	<li>When you are lost, you fall into the dust. Here the dust represents sins. To fall into the dust is to fall into sins.</li>
	<li>So the result of being lost is to fall into the filth of sins, and to live in a heap of sins.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God comes to seek men
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The first parable in Luke 15 speaks about God as the shepherd coming to seek the lost sheep. This second parable speaks about God as the woman seeking the lost money. The shepherd seeks the lost sheep out in the field, whereas the woman seeks the money inside the house. The first parable is objective; the second is subjective.</li>
	<li>The woman seeking the lost money typifies the Holy Spirit coming into our heart to seek us. Just as the shepherd typifies Christ, so the woman typifies the Holy Spirit. In the first parable the objective seeking is the coming of Christ to this earth nearly 2,000 years ago. In the second parable the Holy Spirit comes into our heart, which is the subjective seeking.</li>
	<li>The steps the Holy Spirit takes to seek men:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The first step is to light the lamp. Because there is darkness, there is the need to light the lamp. The lamp typifies the enlightening of the Holy Spirit. This is related to the fact that within man is darkness. The Holy Spirit comes to enlighten us through the words of the Bible. Friends, the gospel which you are listening to today is the enlightening of the Holy Spirit.</li>
		<li>The second step is to sweep the house. The house represents man&rsquo;s heart. The sweeping represents the moving of the Holy Spirit. The heart which has not been swept is not only dark and dirty, but also quiet. After the Holy Spirit lights the lamp and sweeps the heart, the heart is tossed about and becomes restless.</li>
		<li>The third step is to seek diligently. The diligent seeking of the Spirit causes you to have a thorough consideration and a keen feeling. As the Holy Spirit enlightens and moves within you, you will begin to consider the past and the future.</li>
		<li>The fourth step is the finding. The Holy Spirit will seek until you are brought back to God.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to receive God&rsquo;s seeking
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Confess that you are a lost one.</li>
	<li>Repent and turn to God.</li>
	<li>Receive the enlightening and the leading of the Holy Spirit.</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
