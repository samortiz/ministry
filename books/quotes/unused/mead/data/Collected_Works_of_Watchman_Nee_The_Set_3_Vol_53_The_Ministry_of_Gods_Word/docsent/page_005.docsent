   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEW TESTAMENT MINISTERS OF THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE APOSTLES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is another kind of minister of the word in the New Testament the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The ministry of the word in the Old Testament was completely objective.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The ministry of the word in the Lord Jesus was completely subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Old Testament the ministry of the word was realized when the word came upon a man and the man's voice was used as a carrier.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Lord Jesus the ministry of the word was not through the visitation of the word but through the embodiment of the word as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The word took on not only the human voice but human thoughts, feelings, and opinions as well.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Everything that belonged to this man was being employed by the word, because every aspect of this man was in harmony with God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This man is the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we come to the apostles in the New Testament ministry of the word, we find a ministry with the same nature as that of the ministry of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We also find the element of the Old Testament revelation mingled with the nature of the Lord Jesus' ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The difference between the New Testament ministry of the word and the Lord's ministry of the word is this: In the case of the Lord Jesus, who was God's word becoming flesh, first there was God's word and then there was flesh to match this word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All of the feelings, thoughts, and consciousness of this man were in harmony with God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the case of the New Testament ministry of the word, however, first there is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We all have the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In order for this flesh to become a minister of the word, it has to be transformed to match the requirement of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that the thoughts, feelings, and opinions of the flesh have to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The flesh has to match God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, we can say that the New Testament ministry of the word is different from both its Old Testament counterpart and from the Lord's ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord Jesus' ministry was one hundred percent subjective; He Himself was the word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The New Testament ministry, on the other hand, is the ministry of the prophets plus the ministry of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is the visitation of God's word, the revelation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But there are also human feelings, thoughts, and opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Collectively, we can call these aspects the human elements.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The New Testament ministry of the word is divine revelation plus human elements.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Men chosen by God in the New Testament are different from the Lord Jesus, who is God's "holy thing" Luke 1:35 and God's Holy One.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Him there is not a hint of any mixture; His word was God's very word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>With the men chosen by God in the New Testament, we have a different story.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In addition to depositing His word into their being, God had to deal with the persons themselves; He had to build them up.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the one hand, God put His word into such persons.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the other hand, He dealt with them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God used their thoughts, feelings, and characteristics, yet at the same time He dealt with them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God dealt with the New Testament ministers of the word in their experience, speaking, feeling, thoughts, opinions, and characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He dealt with them before He used them to express His word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A New Testament minister of the word not only has God's word and not only releases God's word with his human voice but expresses God's word through his human life in its full dimensions.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God is pleased to put His word into a man and to allow such a man to express His word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord Jesus is the word becoming the flesh, while the New Testament ministers are those who express the word in a flesh that has been dealt with by God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>HUMAN ELEMENTS WITHIN DIVINE INSPIRATION</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some presume that no human element can ever be contained in divine inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They think that once the human element is involved, the divine inspiration is no longer divine.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Those who think this way do not understand the nature of inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God's inspiration does contain human elements.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In fact, His word is expressed through human elements.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although the human elements in the prophetic ministry of the Old Testament were minimal, one cannot say that they were completely absent.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At the least God used the human mouth to convey His message.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord Jesus was the Word becoming flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All the human elements within Him were God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today in the New Testament age, God secures ministers of His word by expressing His word through human beings with human elements.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If one reads the New Testament carefully, it is clear that Paul frequently used words that Peter never used.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>John used some words that Matthew never used.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some words are found only in Luke's writings, while others are found only in Mark's writings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In studying the Bible, we find that every writer has his special characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Gospel of Matthew is different from the Gospel of Mark, and the Gospel of Mark is different from the Gospel of Luke or the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Paul's Epistles were written in one style, while Peter's Epistles were written in another style.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>John's Gospel and Epistles contain the same subject; they are related.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For example, the first sentence of the Gospel of John says, "In the beginning..."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The first sentence of his first Epistle says, "That which was from the beginning..."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>One speaks of the beginning, and the other speaks of that which was from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The book of Revelation, which was also written by John, echoes his Gospel and Epistles and contains the same style.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Moreover, we can observe that every writer uses idiomatic expressions which are distinctly his own.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Luke was a doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In describing sicknesses, he freely used medical terms.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The other three writers of the Gospels only described these ailments in general terms.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The book of Acts was written by Luke as well, and we find the same free use of medical terminology.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Every Gospel has distinctive terminologies and themes.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>For example, Mark is unique in its use of the word immediately, Matthew, in the use of the phrase the kingdom of the heavens, and Luke, in the use of the phrase the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>All these are unique characteristics of the writers.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Every book of the Bible is impregnated with the marks of its writer, yet every book remains very much the word of God.</S>
