<h2 class="head1">SELF-CONTROL, ENDURANCE, AND GODLINESS</h2><p>In verse 6 Peter goes on to say, &ldquo;And in knowledge self-control, and in self-control endurance, and in endurance godliness.&rdquo; Self-control is the exercise of control over the self in its passions, desires, and habits. In our knowledge we need to develop such a self-control.</p><p>In our self-control we need to develop endurance. Self-control is related to the self, but endurance is related to others and to our circumstances. As to ourselves, we must have self-control, and as to our circumstances, no matter what they may be, we need endurance. We need to have endurance with the members of our family, with our neighbors, and with various things that disturb us. For example, when you are bothered by something in your environment, you need endurance. We need to develop endurance in order to bear with others and with our circumstances.</p><p>In verse 6 Peter also says that in our endurance we need to develop godliness. Godliness means God-likeness, that is, being like God and expressing God. The Christian life should be a life that expresses God and bears God&rsquo;s likeness in all things. As we exercise control over the self and bear with others and with circumstances, we also need to develop godliness so that we may be like God and express Him.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR A NOBLE LOVE</h2><p>In verse 7 Peter goes on to say, &ldquo;And in godliness brotherly love, and in brotherly love love.&rdquo; We have pointed out that in godliness, the expression of God, brotherly love, which is brotherly affection, needs to be supplied. We have also seen that the Greek word for &ldquo;love&rdquo; in verse 7 is <i>agape,</i> the word used in the New Testament for the divine love, which God is in His nature (1 John 4:8, 16). This kind of love is nobler than brotherly love, and it is stronger in ability and greater in capacity than human love.</p><p>The brothers and sisters in the church life may love one another, but their love may be rather superficial. In their love there may be no life supply and no &ldquo;antibiotic&rdquo; to foster healing. This means that their love is lacking in <i>agape.</i> But in Peter&rsquo;s love for the brothers there is another element, and this element is the divine love, a love that supplies us with wisdom to love the brothers in a proper way. Sometimes we love others foolishly, in a way that can spoil them. We do not have the wisdom to love them in a way that will enable them to receive the life supply and be nourished. God&rsquo;s love is not only nourishing, but also contains a spiritual antibiotic that fosters healing and prevents illness. If we love the brothers with divine love, we shall infuse such an antibiotic into them. For example, you may realize that a brother has a certain shortage or weakness. You know that teaching or correction will not help the brother. This brother needs to be loved with a noble love. If you love him with this kind of love, he will receive the life supply and an antibiotic that can kill the &ldquo;germs&rdquo; within him. In the church life we need to love one another with discernment, not foolishly. We need to love the brothers with the high purpose of nourishing them and helping them to be healed.</p><h2 class="head2">Love with Discernment</h2><p>God&rsquo;s love is always with discernment. Matthew 5:45 tells us that God sends rain upon both the just and the unjust. But He does this with wisdom. Sometimes He may withhold rain from a certain region. This does not mean that He does not love the people in that place. He loves them, but He loves them with discernment. Likewise, we should not withhold love from the saints. We should love all the brothers, but we should love them with discernment.</p><p>Our love for the saints should also always be according to a measure or within a limitation. If we love a brother excessively, that love may spoil him. We need to love him only to a certain extent. But another brother may be in need of a greater measure of love. To love others in this way is to love them not merely with brotherly affection but also with <i>agape.</i></p>
