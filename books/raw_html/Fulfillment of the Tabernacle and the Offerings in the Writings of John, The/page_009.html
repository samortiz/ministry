<h2 class=head1>THE DEFINED GOD</h2><p>When we have the living Word with the written Word, we have the defined God. Because God is abstract, mysterious, and invisible, there is the need for God to be the Word in order to explain Himself, define Himself, reveal Himself. The Word in John 1:1 refers to the defined God, the explained God, the expressed God, the revealed God, the God made known to human beings. This is the Word. The Word in John 1:1 refers to our Lord, the living Word, with the Bible, the written Word.<p>In Revelation 19:11-13 we have a picture of Christ judging and making war. Verse 13 says, “And He is clothed with a garment dipped in blood; and His name is called The Word of God.” The name on the Lord’s thigh may be likened to a badge, label, or sign. As He fights against the enemy, He wears a sign saying “The Word of God.” This indicates that the Lord Himself is the Word of God. Do you want to know God? In order to know God, you need to read Christ, study Christ, behold Christ, contemplate Christ, gaze on Christ.<p>However, we cannot know the Lord, the living Word, simply by studying Him or contemplating Him. We also need the Book, the Bible, the written Word. If we would know God, on the one hand we need to contemplate this living Person and, on the other hand, we need to study the Book.<p>We have seen that the Word in John 1:1 refers both to the living Word and the written Word. The Word in this verse is great! This Word is actually God Himself.<p>Throughout the centuries there has been much debate among theologians concerning John 1:1. We have pointed out that, according to John 1:1, Christ is God. Others claim that the last part of this verse should not be translated, “and the Word was God,” but should be rendered, “and the Word was deity.” Some who prefer this translation deny that Jesus Christ is the very God Himself. They may say that He is deity, but not that He is God. They may hold the concept that the Lord Jesus is the Logos and is deity, but deny that He is God Himself.<h2 class=head1>THE TRIUNE GOD DEFINED IN A LIVING PERSON</h2><p>The Word in John 1:1 is the Triune God defined in a living Person. That living Person is not only the Son of God—He is the entire God. Speaking of Christ, Colossians 2:9 says, “For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.” It is difficult to define the word “fullness” as it is used in the Bible. Can you explain the difference between fullness and riches? Some who are familiar with what we have written elsewhere may say that the riches are what Christ is and the fullness is what we become as Christ’s Body as a result of enjoying Christ. However, this explanation is not so helpful here. According to biblical usage, the significance of the word “fullness” surpasses that of the word “riches.” Fullness is more formal. First we have the riches and then the fullness. We may say, therefore, that fullness surpasses riches. Colossians 2:9 says that the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily. This fullness does not dwell in Christ theoretically or invisibly; it dwells in Him bodily.<p>What does the expression “the fullness of the Godhead” refer to? Does it not refer to the entire Godhead, to the complete Person of God? Yes, the fullness of the Godhead is the entire Godhead, including the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Godhead comprises the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. How, then, could we say that the fullness of the Godhead includes only God the Son and not also God the Father and God the Spirit? This would not be logical. Since the Godhead comprises the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, the fullness of the Godhead must be the fullness of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. As the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead, Christ is not only the Son of God, but, the entire God.
