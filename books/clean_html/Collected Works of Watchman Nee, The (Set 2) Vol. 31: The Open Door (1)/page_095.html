<h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Yang Shao-tang, Chu-Wo</h2><p>Brother Pu-yueh:</p><p>I received your card and was greatly comforted! After the Bible study in Lin-Jin, the Holy Spirit stirred up a love for the truth in people. Then I went to the Hong-Dong Missionary School for three days. Although I was only there a short time, the Lord's word gave people a desiring heart. Praise the Lord! I am now preparing to live in Houma. Mr. Ma Bu-ching is also preparing to come. I want to spend a month by myself to pray and study the Bible. May the Lord preserve the quietness of my heart, spirit, and environment. The outward situation is very tense, but praise the Lord for giving us peace. I can still sit calmly to write to the brothers. Missionary Rung and Miss Chui-lan have returned. Presently, Missionary Rung is in Hong-Dong and Miss Chui-lan is in Hou-Ma. Perhaps they will both go to Wen-Hsi to work with Feng-mei, or they might come to live in Chu-Wo. If you have time, please let us know where you are before communication is hindered so that we can pray for you. With regard to the work in Honan, I feel in my heart and spirit a desire for deeper fellowship with the Lord and deeper light. Please pray for me! May the Lord bless you with peace.</p><p>Remembering you,<br />Yang Shao-tang<br />February 26<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Duan Chai-ju, Tien-Shui</h2><p>Dear Brother Yu-chih in the Lord:</p><p>Since coming to the region of Lung-Nan and Tien-Shui in Kansu province, I have been meeting in the churches around here. There are more than ten churches, so I will not be able to go through them all until the end of the year. The Lord is working in every place. Unfortunately, I am a useless servant. I am dry in my spirit and lack love. However, what the Lord has given the brothers and sisters is precious and lovely. Most of the churches belong to the Independent denomination. The brothers are very poor. In some places there are many people, but they do not even have a meeting hall. When it is time for a meeting, they sit in the courtyard outdoors. They do not have chairs, so they put a few boards together to make benches. A few days ago, we were having the table meeting in one place when it suddenly started snowing. Three and four-year-old children and seventy and eighty-year-old grandfathers knelt on the ground together with us to break the bread and eat the Lord's supper in the snow and freezing cold. When I saw this, I could not stop my tears from rolling. May the Lord enlarge my heart to suffer for Him, and may I be more willing to travel for Him in poor regions, accommodate humble people, and remember the poor! How precious these ones are! Peace in the Lord! Please greet the brothers and sisters in the Lord for me.</p><p>Your spiritual brother,<br />Chai-ju<br />Twenty-second day after the Chinese New Year<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Recent Work in Ch'eng-tu</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Thank God for His grace. He brought us safely to Ch'eng-tu through the brothers' and sisters' prayers. I was on a bus for two days. Humanly speaking, I should have been dizzy with a backache, but God gave us exceptional peace. It was more than we could understand. After two days on the road, it was as if I did not feel anything. I was not tired, and my back did not hurt. I feel more and more that I am unworthy because God's grace treats me so well. The more I see my own corruption, the more I feel the greatness of God's grace! Indeed, when the prodigal son returned, he did not do anything but enjoy grace. I saw Brother Chao, Mrs. Chao, Mrs. Shen, and the rest. We were all rejoicing. I really hope to be edified and helped by the brothers and sisters here in Ch'eng-tu.</p><p>Yu-chih<br />March 4</p>
