   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE APPOINTMENT OF THE ELDERS AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE APOSTLES BEING ELDERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Question: According to the Epistles to Timothy, the elders must be appointed by people like Paul, Timothy, or Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Peter and John were elders in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Did James appoint them?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Or were they appointed by themselves when necessary?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Answer: I believe that all the elders need to be appointed; therefore, I mentioned that all the elders must be appointed by the workers when they are in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I want you to pay special attention to what Paul said to the elders of the church in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This church was different from the church at the center of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, they shared the same principle, which is that the Holy Spirit has placed the elders as overseers of the whole flock.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, when the workers and apostles appoint elders in other places, they must have a desire, a seeking, and prayer before God, with the assurance that the persons whom they appoint are the persons whom the Holy Spirit appoints.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Otherwise, the problems will be great.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Holy Spirit appoints one person, but the one you appoint is another person.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The problem this gives to the church is too great.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, as each goes down from the mountain, no brother can become loose or casual in appointing elders in other places.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul had the boldness to say in Ephesus that the Holy Spirit had appointed them as elders.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul did not say that he had appointed them but that the Holy Spirit had appointed them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He had considerable confidence to say that the Holy Spirit had appointed them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, we need to be in fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are afraid of people who are too bold.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should be in fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to see that the responsibility of deciding who are and who are not elders is very heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must have adequate consideration and prayer before God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only those who are appointed by the Holy Spirit are useful.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Otherwise, they will be useless and will sooner or later be problems.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The positions of Peter and John in Jerusalem were quite clear because they were apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The elders are appointed by the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Peter the apostle appointed Peter the elder, and John the apostle appointed John the elder because this responsibility was in the hands of the apostles, and at the same time there was a local need.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Perhaps, among those apostles, they might have all felt that at least these two should bear the local responsibility at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, they both became elders in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Toward the end James had passed away, and the other James remained.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the church in Jerusalem, he was definitely in the forefront.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Perhaps Peter and John were not appointed by him, but I dare not say.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, there hardly was a problem for Peter and John to be elders because they were already apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>BEING SENT MORE</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>IN THE ELEMENT OF FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Question: Peter and John went to Samaria, and the Bible says that the apostles in Jerusalem sent them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Paul and Barnabas went, and the Bible says that the brothers sent them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Why is this?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Answer: In this kind of sending, there is fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You dare not say that there was authority, but at least there was fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Story of Peter and John</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There were twelve apostles in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The matter of Samaria was brought to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Jerusalem knew the situation in Samaria, and they also saw that the believers in Samaria had not received the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Philip only did a part of the work; he did not do the work thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>So Jerusalem felt that Peter and John should go.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Perhaps, while twelve or more than twelve brothers were waiting and praying together, Peter and John felt that they should go, and the rest of the brothers also felt that they should go.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>So they sent Peter and John to Samaria.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is a very beautiful picture.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I dare not say that the matter of authority had no part, but I feel that the matter of authority did not occupy a major role; the greater part was the principle of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Suppose while there are a number of sisters eating together, they feel that one among them should go to a certain sister's home.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is not a matter of authority; rather, everyone considers together who should go.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The principle of fellowship has a greater part than the principle of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I do not say that it has no part, but I say that the greater part is the part of fellowship.</S>
