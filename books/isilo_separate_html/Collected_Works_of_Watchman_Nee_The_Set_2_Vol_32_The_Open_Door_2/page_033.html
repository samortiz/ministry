Later, I lodged temporarily in the little house behind Mr. Hsu's residence and ate elsewhere. I tried to preach the gospel a few times on Dah-Jin Street. A few friends were saved. This was truly the Lord's own work. I also did some edifying work for the brothers and sisters by preaching the message "Who Is Jesus?" It seems that I can only lift up Christ and attract many to Him. Christ has to gain them first before more can be done. I also met two brothers and a few friends in the Southwest United University and have given some of them my personal testimony. This morning, I plan to go to Shi-Ping because Brother Lin has written to me again.</p><p>Brother Chen Hsi-wen, July 11</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Witness Lee</h2><p>I should have left for Tientsin already. However, because of the arrangement by the Lord in the work and because of my health, I have not been able to go yet. Thank the Lord. The Lord willing, I will be going to Tientsin tomorrow and then to Peking. In every place I will stay for about half a month. During the recent months, the Lord has given me new leading concerning the gospel work in north China and in northwest China. It seems that the confirmation is becoming stronger. Thank the Lord! He is also turning much of my attention to the truth concerning the kingdom. I can only acknowledge my unworthiness in the face of all these needs. May the Lord supply us more and release us more! Issue No. 14 of The Christian is almost ready. The "Bible Study" column is the only article that is still pending. I truly hope that this magazine can come out bimonthly, as scheduled. Please pray for this!</p><p>The business of the brothers is generally good. Thank the Lord. Brother Chang Tze-jieh returned to Tsingtao at the beginning of the month. He has indeed grown, and the Lord has clearly used him. Thank the Lord. He will conduct some perfecting meetings in Tsingtao this week. Then he will go to Lai-Yang to preach the gospel.</p><p>Brother Witness, Chefoo, July 11</p><p>(Recently we received a letter from Brother Wang Jien-tang, saying that Brother Witness Lee and the family of his brother Lee Chang-en arrived safely in Tientsin on the morning of July 16. After conducting meetings for two days, he was slightly sick. Thank and praise the Lord, Brother Lee has recovered from the illness, and tonight he will continue to speak on the truth of Luke 14:17. Every night there is an enthusiastic and crowded audience. Many sit by the door, outside the door, and outside the windows. More stand during the whole time. We see the Lord's glory everywhere, and we truly have to praise the Lord&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Hwa Shi-bin, Chekiang</h2><p>Sister Lee:</p><p>Thank and praise the Lord that in the midst of such difficult times we can still proclaim the great grace of His love and redemption. May we accomplish the last part of His plan while we still have a little light. Whenever I read The Open Door and see how the Lord has worked through a few co-workers, I cannot help but give much thanks for the fresh fruit borne in the many inland provinces through our brothers. Hallelujah. In Chekiang to the south of the Yangtze River, the roads are very damaged, which causes much trouble in traveling. But most of the places are still meeting and preaching the gospel. A few of the local churches around Ning-Hai are somewhat revived. For example, we see much of God's work in Shen-Chen and Hai-You. There has been a meeting raised up near San-Men Bay also. When we see the newly saved ones, we rejoice and praise loudly for the great lovingkindness of the Father! Brother Lou Chuan-en and his family have now come to live in Ning-Hai. The Lord has used him to lead the brothers on. Beginning August 4, we will have a conference in Ning-Hai. We hope that Brother Lou will be responsible for this conference. I promised to visit Tai-Shun and Wen-Ling, but I cannot fulfill my promise because of the inaccessibility of the roads. The Lord willing, I will go to Wu-Yih in the fall. As far as my personal life is concerned, I have been very dry and thirsty. I very much wish that Jesus Christ, the source of life, would fill my heart so that I will only be satisfied with Him and not have merely a doctrine of the filling of the Spirit. This is all I will write for now. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>A weak brother in the Lord, Hwa Shi-bin, July 16</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> </body></html>
