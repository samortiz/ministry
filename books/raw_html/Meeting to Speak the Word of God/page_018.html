AND ATMOSPHERE OF THE MEETING</h1>
<h2 class="head1">OUTLINE</h2>
<ol class="upper-roman" start="7">
<li>Following the flow and atmosphere (the Spirit) of the meeting:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Not being insensitive to the feeling of the meeting nor acting independently.</li>
	<li>Not speaking too long, encroaching upon others&rsquo; portion, nor replacing others by doing everything.</li>
	<li>Learning to exercise the spirit, speaking from the depths of your being with a strong voice so that others can hear.</li>
	<li>Admonishing and correcting those whose speaking is too soft, repetitious, or time consuming, with a tender spirit and the humble and amiable tongue of a learner.</li>
	<li>Caring for the need of those attending the meeting, ministering the word according to the need, and if unbelievers are present, being flexible to make changes and minister the word of the gospel according to the situation in the meeting.</li>
	<li>Taking care of the supply of reality in every meeting, and whenever this supply is lacking, endeavoring to make up this lack, to strengthen the supply of the word, and to bring the meeting to a proper conclusion.</li>

<h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO BE ABLE TO SING THE HYMNS<br />
IN ORDER TO HAVE GOOD MEETINGS</h2>
<p>Hymn #837 is an excellent hymn. First, this hymn contains truth; it is a hymn on the truth related to the matter of building. After presenting the truth, it then brings in the matter of experience. Verse 6 of this hymn says:</p>
<p class="hbody">Here, Lord, we give ourselves to Thee;<br />
Receive us into Thy wise hands;<br />
Bend, break, and build together in Thee<br />
To be the house to meet Thy demands.</p>
<p>Verse 7 continues:</p>
<p class="hbody">Break all the natural life for us,<br />
Deal Thou with each peculiar way,<br />
That we no more independent be<br />
But with all saints are one for aye.</p>
<p>What is written here is all related to experience.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this hymn, with eight syllables per line, is composed of two groups of four stanzas that convey a very rhythmic feeling as we sing. A hymn composed of excellent words and matching rhyme coupled with a good meter and an appropriate melody is a very successful piece.</p>
<p>Let us now look at hymn #841. Although this is a hymn on the experience of life, it eventually leads to the building. The first two lines of this hymn are:</p>
<p class="hbody">Thou art all my life,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord, In me Thou dost live...</p>
<p>The final stanza of this hymn says:</p>
<p class="hbody">I would cease completely<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From my efforts vain,<br />
Let Thy life transform me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full release to gain;<br />
Build me up with others<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till in us Thou see<br />
Thy complete expression<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glorifying Thee.</p>
<p>I am speaking these things to you so that you can realize that in order to have good meetings we must know how to sing the hymns.</p>
