   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO UNDERSTANDING CHARACTER THE IMPORTANCE OF CHARACTER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Whereas our words represent our person, our character is our very person.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A person s usefulness, the things which can be entrusted to him, the responsibilities he can bear, and the things he is able to accomplish altogether depend on his character.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A carpenter determines the use of a piece of wood based on its quality.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Laziness ruins one s usefulness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Accordingly, character has very much to do with the Lord s service.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Consider those persons in the Bible whom God used.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They were used by God because they possessed a character that was fit for His use.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Their character was simply their person.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They became persons useful to God because their character could be used by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since Abraham, Moses, and Paul all had an excellent character, God greatly used them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The destiny of our usefulness to the Lord hinges on our character.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whether we are useful before God depends upon the suitability of our human character.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE CONSTITUTION OF CHARACTER</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our character is constituted of our inborn nature plus our acquired habits.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whereas disposition is inborn, character is cultivated.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A person s character is thirty percent nature and seventy percent habit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For this reason, a young person must pay full attention to character building.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A person over the age of fifty has a set personality with a definite pattern that has been developed over his lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In a young person, more inborn nature than acquired habit is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As he grows older, he displays less of his nature and more of his habits.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Consequently, acquired habits are more important than inborn nature.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Generally, the character of a person over the age of twenty already contains more habit than nature.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Never neglect your daily living, for it builds up your habits.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For example, if a child is placed in a Chinese home, he will be cast into a Chinese mold.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The same child placed in a family of another nationality will resemble a person of that nationality when he grows up.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In considering the matter of character, we must give heed to our daily life, which is able to mold our character.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The suitability of our character to God determines our usefulness to God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE CHARACTER ESSENTIAL</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>FOR THE LORD S SERVICE 1.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Genuine Being the Same Within and Without</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What is genuineness?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It denotes a consistency within and without.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In many instances no lying is involved, but there certainly is an absence of genuineness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A person who is not genuine is useless in the Lord s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Moses was a most genuine person.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When he came down from Mount Sinai, he broke the two tablets in anger.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He was the same within and without.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is impossible to find a case in the Bible where Moses was not consistent through and through.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A genuine person is solid and trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This does not mean, however, that a person should be free to lose his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To behave in a pleasant way when you are actually irate is to pretend and to be false.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some people speak on a subject to two people in two different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>While they may not have the intention to deceive, they do not speak genuinely.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Those who serve the Lord must cultivate a genuine character.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In confronting certain matters, we may refrain from speaking anything because of our fear of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, if we do speak, we must be genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Exact Being Absolutely Accurate</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is very difficult to be exact with respect to time, words, and numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many things are done in a just-to-get-by manner.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This more-or-less attitude is most damaging.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A person must not be more-or-less ; he must be accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Accomplishing ninety-nine percent of a task, leaving one percent undone, is the same as not having done it at all.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should develop a character that is not sloppy but absolutely accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must be exact both in word and in deed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Strict Taking Matters Seriously</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Genuineness makes one solid, and exactness makes one strong.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Strictness is the practice of genuineness and exactness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Genuineness and exactness can never be practiced by a loose person.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To do everything genuinely and exactly requires a strict character.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Whatever passes through the hands of a loose person becomes somewhat inaccurate and lacking in genuineness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Because a loose person is not strict, whatever he says must be discounted.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Even his study of the Bible is sloppy.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Those who are strict receive light while studying the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They never let things go.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When problems arise, they proceed to solve them, always tracing to the root of the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>A loose person, who usually is curious and lives in his imagination, can never solve problems.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>A strict person never meddles in matters that do not concern him, nor does he entertain idle thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He performs his task seriously and accurately.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Diligent Not Slothful</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>A strict person is always diligent.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Diligence is the most important characteristic of a servant of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Bible is full of teachings concerning diligence.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In Romans chapter twelve, Paul mentions consecration, serving in coordination, and gifts, and follows his word with not slothful in zeal v. 11 . One must be diligent in service.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Diligence is crucial because it builds up our spiritual reserve and thus enriches us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Spiritual wealth comes from diligence.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Laziness invariably produces poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He who is diligent is always soberminded, whereas he who is lazy is usually muddleheaded.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>All things exist in time.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>A successful person is one who seizes his time.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We must redeem our lost time.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Laziness is detestable because it causes our being to be squandered.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It swallows our time and will eventually devour our whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Diligence, however, cannot be a matter of legality or of regulation; it should be practiced spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We should be the same whether seen or unseen by others.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>As a person becomes diligent, he will require much more of himself.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>One who is lazy can never clean thoroughly, because he is stiff-backed and will not even bend his waist to sweep the floor.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>An unconcerned person is lazy, but he who is concerned yet does not take action is a person who has not been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Only the diligent know to work.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The Lord s servant must cultivate a diligent character and never let himself go easily.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Then he will be able to handle whatever God entrusts to him.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Only those who are diligent can do the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The more a person works, the more he will become humble, practical, and careful, and the more he will control his temper and reject his flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This is most profitable before God.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>One who is diligent finishes thoroughly all the work that is around him and has been committed to him.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>D. L. Moody said, I have yet to see a lazy person get saved.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Some people are actually too lazy to believe and to ask; thus, they miss such a great matter as their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>It is difficult to find a slothful person who has much spiritual pursuit.</S>
