   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I mentioned earlier that repentance can never be separated from faith; it is included in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before man repents, he cannot believe.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After a man has some faith, he must repent.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If a man has a certain amount of faith in God's word, he must repent.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One cannot cut the matter neatly with a pair of scissors, with one side being faith and the other side being repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This resembles the salvation experience of many people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you ask one hundred people when they were saved, perhaps only fifty can give you the exact date and year of their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The other half would not know when they were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They do not know how they received God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To them it matters little how they were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The important thing is that they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is all right if they do not know the date of their birth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As long as they are born, they feel that it is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, we can see that at the beginning, the word of God was first preached 2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If they had not believed, why would they be pricked in their hearts?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may ask that if they had indeed believed, why would Peter have said that they must repent and be baptized before their sins could be forgiven and the Holy Spirit be poured out?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If they had believed, why were their sins not forgiven yet, and why was the Holy Spirit not poured out yet?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we say that they had not believed, then why were they so concerned after they heard God's word?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Why did they ask what they must do?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have to realize that when the word of God is preached, different people have different reactions according to their own condition.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The condition in Acts was different.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some sinners feel that they have sinned, and they are sorrowful for their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we preach the gospel to such people, we may never mention repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But some people come to believe in Him without having realized their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Such people must be brought back to the point of repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, when we preach the gospel, we have to pay attention to this difference.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some have come to the Lord through repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We only have to ask them to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For others, we have to lead them to repentance and conviction concerning themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even after God has given them faith and they have believed, we still must persuade them to be baptized and have a heart of repentance before their sins can be forgiven and the Holy Spirit can be poured upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, we see that repentance can be included in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If a man does not repent, how can he believe?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If a man does not realize that he is sick, he will not be willing to see a doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Moreover, repentance can also be included in salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Man is to believe in God's word, be forgiven, and receive the Holy Spirit after he repents.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, we see that Acts 3 speaks of faith also.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This man is saved and healed by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is so clear that what is spoken of here is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we come to chapter seventeen we see something else.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Acts 17:30 says, "Therefore, having overlooked the times of ignorance, God now charges all men everywhere to repent."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Here, God does not tell man to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If it were up to us, we would surely have changed the word "repent" to "believe."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But what Paul was talking about in the following verses was not a question of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If he were to tell us that man has sinned and that the Son of God has accomplished the work of redemption and has solved the problem of sin, then he would have to mention faith.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But here Paul was talking about judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verse 31 says, "Because He has set a day in which He is to judge the world in righteousness by the man whom He has designated, having furnished proof to all by raising Him from the dead."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God has designated the Lord Jesus as the Judge to judge all men.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At the same time, in order to let everyone know that He has designated the Lord Jesus as the Judge, God has raised Jesus from among the dead as a proof of their faith.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is why it says that we have to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>So, this is not a question of faith here.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Through His resurrection from the dead, the Lord Jesus has become a proof of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is worthy of our belief already.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Now there is no need to talk about faith anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The resurrection of the Lord Jesus is here as a proof; it is clear and beyond doubt.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Now what we must do is repent for the things that we have done.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then we will be able to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord Jesus is worthy of our belief.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As long as we repent, we can believe.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Acts 26:19-20 says, "Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, but declared both to those in Damascus first and in Jerusalem and throughout all the country of Judea and to the Gentiles that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we read these two verses only, we would think that the only thing that Paul was preaching was repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Paul confessed before King Agrippa's judgment that his work was to cause men to repent and turn to God and do works worthy of repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If that was all, then the gospel according to Acts would not be a gospel of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In order to understand this verse, we must look at the previous passage.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We cannot take a portion of Scripture out of context.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is unfair to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Verses 14-20 say, "And when we all fell to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew dialect, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is hard for you to kick against the goads.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>And I said, Who are You, Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>And the Lord said, I am Jesus, whom you persecute.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But rise up and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you as a minister and a witness both of the things in which you have seen Me and of the things in which I will appear to you; delivering you from the people and from the Gentiles, to whom I send you, to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified by faith in Me. Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, but declared both to those in Damascus first and in Jerusalem and throughout all the country of Judea and to the Gentiles that they should repent." Why do they have to repent? It is because the Lord Jesus has accomplished the work of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>All those who believe in Him will surely obtain this redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Repentance is something for the believing ones.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Everything is done.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Now, all that is needed is to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>What is to repent?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Formerly, one says that there is no need to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Now, he says that he will believe.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Suppose I see a person today, and I preach the gospel to him, telling him that the Lord Jesus has accomplished everything.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I may say, "My friend, you have to repent and believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>As soon as you believe, you will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You have to have a different view towards sin.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>You also have to have a different view towards faith in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>You have to repent of your inward condition; in this way you will be able to believe."</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We can see that the repentance spoken of here is not a matter of works.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>How do we know that it is not a matter of works?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It is because repentance is included in God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Repentance is a part of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Not only does this repentance have nothing to do with man's work, but it becomes one item within the scope of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In the few verses that we just read, we can see one mysterious thing that repenting is a part of believing.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Without repentance, there cannot be faith.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Hence, faith includes repentance, and repentance is in faith.</S>
