   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Before we examine the significant aspects of Jacob's prophecy regarding Reuben, Simeon, and Levi, I wish to point out that according to Jacob's prophecy with blessing, it is possible for our natural status and disposition to be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Perhaps you were born good.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But do not be proud of your goodness, for you may become bad.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you were born bad, you should not be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Rather, you should have the faith that you will become good.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is both a warning and an encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As the firstborn, Reuben had the preeminence.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, he lost his preeminence, and his natural status, his status by birth, was changed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, we should neither be disappointed nor complacent.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Instead, we should be careful lest we lose our birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Moreover, although you were not actually born the first, you may become the firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Joseph was born eleventh, but he eventually became the first.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In most cases of the shifting of the birthright in the Bible, the birthright is shifted from the first to the second.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Upon hearing this word, a thoughtful person may say, "I was born neither number one nor number two.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I was born number eleven.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No matter how many times the birthright is shifted, it will never be shifted to me."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But be confident and be encouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although you may be number eleven, God still has a way to make you number one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He did it with Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Be impressed with the fact that it is possible for your natural status to be changed either for the better or for the worse.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not blame God for making you number eleven instead of number one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we try to blame God in this way, He may say, "Dear child, read Genesis 49 again.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although you were born number eleven, your status can be changed to number one."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Throughout the years, I have been speaking to the elders about their disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I admit that my word on this matter has been strong and sharp as a two-edged sword piercing into the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the elders ask me how they can be more useful, I always tell them that their usefulness depends upon their disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I have often told them that their natural disposition is the main reason they are not useful.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many have been disappointed by this word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But here in Genesis 49 there is some good news for those who have been disappointed about their natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this group of three brothers we see not only that our natural status may be changed, but also that our natural disposition can be used by God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, as we shall see later in this message, God can use our disposition only if certain conditions are met.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Jacob put Simeon and Levi together in his prophecy because they were the same in character and disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Their disposition was exposed in chapter thirty-four, the chapter that records the defilement of their sister, Dinah, and their revenge on Hamor and Shechem.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Simeon, Levi, and Dinah were all born of the same mother.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, these brothers dearly loved their sister.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When they learned that she had been defiled, their disposition was exposed by the way they killed all the males in the city of Shechem, plundered the city, and even hamstrung the cattle.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How cruel they were!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The cruelty of Simeon and Levi terrified Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In his entire life Jacob had never been as frightened as he was in chapter thirty-four.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Nevertheless, in God's sovereignty, the events in that chapter were a great help to Jacob's maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These events were the strong sunshine that helped to burn Jacob into maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, in chapter thirty-five we see a real change in Jacob's life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Jacob, however, could not forget what Simeon and Levi had done.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, in 49:6 Jacob said of them, "O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their company, my glory, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their self-will they hamstrung oxen" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The word "glory" "honor" in KJV refers to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What Simeon and Levi had done made such a deep impression on Jacob's spirit that he could not grant them any blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Deuteronomy 33, however, Moses did bless Levi.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The blessing in Genesis 49 was by a father who had a loving concern for his sons.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But the prophecy in Deuteronomy 33 was by an old man who represented the law.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whatever he prophesied was the judgment according to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Nevertheless, that judgment was filled with mercy, and Levi received a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Although Jacob loved his sons and was very concerned about them, he could not give a blessing to Simeon and Levi.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Genesis 49:5 says, "Simeon and Levi are brethren; their swords are weapons of violence" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The word regarding Simeon and Levi being brethren means that they were companions, that they formed one company.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Their swords were weapons of violence.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As we have pointed out, verse 6 reveals their cruelty.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In verse 7 Jacob said, "Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Jacob did not say, "Cursed be Simeon and Levi"; rather, he said, "Cursed be their anger and their wrath."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although they deserved to be cursed, their father did not curse them; instead, he cursed their anger and exercised judgment over them to divide them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The best way to deal with those who are cruel is to scatter them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Regarding Simeon and Levi, Jacob seemed to say, "Simeon and Levi were too cruel.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They showed no mercy or kindness.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Yes, Hamor and Shechem were wrong in defiling Dinah.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It would have been sufficient to kill them.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Simeon and Levi didn't have to kill all the males of the city nor to hamstring their oxen.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I will not allow them to stay together.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The best thing to do is to scatter them."</S>
