<div class='line'><b>1</b> Man's Creator has a purpose</div>
<div class='line'>For our being here on earth.</div>
<div class='line'>In His image we're created,</div>
<div class='line'>To express His rule on earth.</div>
<div class='line'>But man fell to Satan's tempting;</div>
<div class='line'>Thus God's goal was hid from view.</div>
<div class='line'>Still our God will have His Kingdom,</div>
<div class='line'>For His Son will see it through.</div>
</div>
<div class='chorus'>
<div class='line'>Jesus Christ will get His Kingdom</div>
<div class='line'>Inspite of Satan and his plans.</div>
<div class='line'>He's getting something real and solid</div>
<div class='line'>By growing in the hearts of man.</div>
<div class='line'>It's nothing like religion teaches,</div>
<div class='line'>"You have to wait until you die."</div>
<div class='line'>For the Kingdom Christ is building,</div>
<div class='line'>Is here on earth before our eyes.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>2</b> His Son, Jesus, is our Savior.</div>
<div class='line'>Once in human form He came.</div>
<div class='line'>Now as the Spirit He can enter</div>
<div class='line'>As the breath of life to man.</div>
<div class='line'>As a seed within our spirit</div>
<div class='line'>Christ takes root and starts to grow,</div>
<div class='line'>Spreading in our inmost being</div>
<div class='line'>Till His life we come to know.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>3</b> Time is short, oh brothers hear it.</div>
<div class='line'>Christ is longing for His Bride.</div>
<div class='line'>We can hasten His returning,</div>
<div class='line'>Simply by the growth in life.</div>
<div class='line'>No more struggling, no more striving,</div>
<div class='line'>Simply turn to Christ within.</div>
<div class='line'>See the seed begin to blossom,</div>
<div class='line'>Growing fully into Him.</div>
</div>
<div class='chorus'>
<div class='line'>Jesus Christ will get His Kingdom</div>
<div class='line'>By growing in a normal way.</div>
<div class='line'>It's not an instant transformation.</div>
<div class='line'>This growth goes on from day to day.</div>
<div class='line'>The seed of life is all-inclusive.</div>
<div class='line'>It's got everything we'll ever need.</div>
<div class='line'>Yes, our God's eternal purpose</div>
<div class='line'>Is all within this precious seed.</div>
