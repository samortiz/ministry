   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRODIGAL SON Issue No. 20 Scripture Reading: Luke 15:11-32</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I have spoken on this passage three times already.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Today I will not speak much about it again.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I am not going to cover the whole parable but only point out a few things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I will speak a little here and a little there in a fragmentary way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verses 17 through 19 say, "But when he came to himself, he said, How many of my father's hired servants abound in bread, but I am perishing here in famine!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I will rise up and go to my father, and I will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whenever a sinner becomes repentant through the operation of his environment, he has a certain evaluation concerning his own salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If a man does not want to be saved, he will not have any consideration concerning his salvation; he will not care about the matter or be bothered about it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But once he is awakened, he will begin to consider how he can be saved and what are the conditions for one to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you ask any sinner about the way of salvation, you will find out that he has his own idea of being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God has His way of salvation, and a sinner has his way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I am afraid that with a hundred sinners, there are a hundred different ways of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Everyone has his concept, and everyone has his evaluation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The prodigal son had his way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He thought that when he saw his father, his father would rebuke him with a stern face, and so he would answer, "The inheritance that you gave me has been spent.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I cannot use another penny of yours anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But you are a rich man and have many hired servants.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Just hire me as you have hired one of your servants."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For him, salvation was not to be a son but a slave only!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A sinner's way of salvation is by giving others what they deserve and receiving back what they deserve.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is by working for others and receiving wages from them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The amount of work one does is the amount of wages one receives.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is by being a slave and not a son.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verses 20 through 22 say, "And he rose up and came to his own father.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and was moved with compassion, and he ran and fell on his neck and kissed him affectionately.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But the father said to his slaves, Bring out quickly the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The prodigal son rose up to come to his father.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When he saw the father, he repeated the speech he had planned.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He said that he was not worthy to be called his son and was going to say more, "but the father said to his slaves."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"But the father."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Salvation is according to God's concept and not according to our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No one in the world is saved according to what he thinks but according to what God thinks.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The prodigal son's concept was to only be a hired servant.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our thoughts are filled with the law, which is always a question of doing something and receiving something back in return.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The prodigal son had prepared a speech for his father.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But when he saw the father and was touched by his love, the prepared sentence, "Make me like one of your hired servants," did not come out.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we read the whole passage carefully, we will see that he did not say these words because he was interrupted by his father and had no chance; it was not because he did not want to continue speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His father had heard enough and did not want to wait for him to finish his words.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"But the father said to his slaves, Bring out quickly the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Salvation tells us how God wants to treat us, not how we think that God should treat us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to our concept, we will always be a hired servant.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we remember the Lord, we think of ourselves as sinners, but God considers us as sons.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We think that we deserve to perish, but He puts us at the feasting table.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We cannot speak enough of God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even as we repeat it again and again, we are not afraid that it will occupy too much of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We may think that we are not worthy to be called sons, but He has done more than we can imagine.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thank the Lord that salvation is not according to our thoughts or our concepts but according to God's thought.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>While the prodigal was still a long way off, the father saw him and was moved with compassion.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Samaritan saw the man who fell among the robbers on his way to Jericho and was moved with compassion Luke 10:30-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What is compassion?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Only after a person has fallen into a low estate can compassion be exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Compassion is directed downward from above; it is applied in mercy towards someone.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If the son had come back in a grand manner, there would have been no way that the father could have shown compassion toward him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>How was compassion exercised?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When the father saw that the son had degraded into the position of a beggar and actually was a beggar, compassion was exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Only a beggar can become a son.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Only a beggar standing by the door can sit at the feasting table.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Only a beggar far from God can draw nigh to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When our condition becomes that of a beggar, God's compassion is moved.</S>
