   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MEANING OF FOOT-WASHING The Feet Touching the Earth,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Which Signifies the World</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now let us look at the meaning of foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We know that our feet touch the earth all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our hands, head, and back do not have to touch the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But our feet come into contact with the earth all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We can say that as long as we are men, we have to touch the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As long as we live on this earth, we will come into contact with this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The head is for thinking, the hands are for working, the heart is for loving, the legs are for exercising, the back is for resting, and the feet are for contacting the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here the Lord was not washing the hands.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Jews washed their hands before they ate.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yet the Lord washed the disciples' feet before they ate.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He did not wash the head, the back, or the hands; He washed the feet.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a profound lesson, and I hope that I can express it adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brothers, on this earth man is alienated from God because of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, this problem is solved through the Lord's shed blood on the cross; the sins that we committed as a sinner have been washed away.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After being saved and becoming a believer, the Lord's overcoming life enables us to overcome all sins.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The judgment on sin was settled on the cross, and today the power of sin can be overcome through Him as the overcoming life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, let me ask a question: Other than sin, is there anything else which separates us from God?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those who are honest will say that there are many things which separate us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These things may not be sin, but there may be worldly elements that are produced through our contact with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Defilement of the Feet Signifies Separation</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>from God through Contact with the World,</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>While Foot-washing Signifies the Recovery of</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Spiritual Freshness and Fellowship with the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Suppose this morning you had a quiet time before the Lord; you read the Word and prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The prayer time was sweet and the Lord's Word was precious.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You felt that heaven was so close to earth that you could almost touch it with your hands.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This was between five and seven o'clock in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By eight o'clock, numerous affairs of the day began to occupy you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some have to conduct their businesses; others have to teach at school or go to their offices.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some have to go to school, while others have to visit the sick, shop, clean the house, or do laundry.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There are many things which are waiting to be done.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When you read the Bible and prayed in the morning, you felt that heaven was very close.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But as a businessman who spends three to six hours in your office doing many seemingly "proper" things you may not have lied or sinned at all , are you still as close to God in the evening as you were in the morning?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No, you are not.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Students busy themselves in schoolwork at the schools, and housewives engage themselves in their household chores at home.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once a person occupies himself in these affairs, he feels as if heaven has moved away.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is no longer as close as it was in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He may still be able to set aside some time to pray, but he has nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He can only touch the superficial letter of the Word; he can no longer touch the inward reality.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the prayer meeting comes, he may want to pray, but he is short of words.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even when he does manage to think of some words to say, his conscience bothers him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He may still shout hallelujah, and the words and sounds may still be the same, but the meaning and taste are different.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He feels that something has separated him from God, but he cannot pinpoint any sin.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It seems as if confession does not help the situation either.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If he was separated from God through sin, he should deal with it through the application of the blood shed on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But this does not seem to be a question of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He only feels somewhat dimmed and has lost the former brightness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is the need of something else to deal with this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is different from ordinary sins.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What is needed is the foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What is foot-washing?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is dealing with everything apart from sin that separates us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This happens to us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We do not sin, but neither do we touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is understandable when a person is separated from God through sin.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But we do not know what to do when we have not sinned, yet cannot touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thank the Lord that He has not only washed us of our sins, but washed our feet as well.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is not the washing of our hands; the hands signify the things we do.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Whether or not we do things is our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is not the washing of our head; the head signifies our thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Whether or not we think certain things is our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is not the washing of our backs.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Whether or not we lie down is our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If our head, hands, or backs have a problem, we have sinned because the activities associated with these parts are under our control.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Our feet however have no choice but to stand on the ground; this is something that is not up to us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What do the feet signify?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The feet signify our contact with our family, business, and schools.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>These are unavoidable contacts in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As long as we are human beings and live in this world, we have to stand on the ground and touch the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This will continue until the day the Lord comes back to rapture us away.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When Jacob was about to die, the Bible says that he gathered up his feet into his bed Gen 49:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This meant that from that day on, he would no longer need to use his feet; he could go to his fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Before we go to our fathers, our feet are still on the ground; they are not gathered up into our bed.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The feet signify our inevitable and non-sinful contact with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This contact is not sinful, yet it can separate us from God and make heaven less near to us and our prayers less sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>While living on this earth, our feet are easily defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We have to use our feet whether we are standing up or sitting down.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Of all the members of our body, the feet tire us out the most easily.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I am not saying that the other parts of the body will not tire us out; but the feet tire us out most easily.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In the same way, it is very easy for a spiritual man to become defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>How many spiritual men sitting here tonight have feet that are defiled?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I know that many of our feet have been defiled.</S>
