   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE FIFTY-TWO THE GREAT PROSTITUTE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>SITTING ON A SCARLET BEAST 2</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous message we considered the great prostitute.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now we shall consider the scarlet beast upon which the prostitute rides, as described in Revelation 17.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE SCARLET BEAST A. Coming Up out of the Abyss</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have seen that the rider is the Roman Church and that the beast is the Roman Empire, especially Antichrist, the coming seventh Caesar of the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Revelation 17:8 says, The beast whom you saw was, and is not, and is about to come up out of the abyss and go into destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The beast, who is Antichrist, was in the person of Caesar Nero before John wrote this book.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is not at the time of John s writing, because Nero had died by that time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is about to come up out of the abyss.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This implies that Nero s spirit is now in the abyss and, as indicated in 13:3, is about to emerge from it to take possession of the body of the slain and resuscitated Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>B. Its Color</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The beast is scarlet in color 17:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Scarlet, a dark red color, is the color of the great dragon 12:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The fact that the beast and the dragon are the same color indicates that Antichrist will be one with Satan in appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>C. Full of Names of Blasphemy</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This beast is full of names of blasphemy 17:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The seven Caesars, symbolized by the seven heads of the beast, called themselves god.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This was sheer blasphemy against God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These Caesars assumed deity and called for their people to worship them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who did not worship them were persecuted.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>D. Having Seven Heads 1.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Seven Mountains on Which</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>the City of Rome Is Built</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 3 also indicates that the beast has seven heads.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 9 says, The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The city of Rome is built on seven mountains, signified by the seven heads of the beast on which the prostitute sits.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Seven Kings</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 10, speaking of the seven mountains, which are the seven heads of the beast, says, And are seven kings: five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he comes, he must remain a little while.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The seven kings are seven Caesars of the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to history, the Roman Empire had twelve Caesars; Antichrist will be the thirteenth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Out of the twelve Caesars, only six are included in the prophecy of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The first five have fallen; that is, they have died unnaturally Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>3:25; 2 Sam 1:10, 25, 27 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They were Julius Caesar.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero, all of whom either were murdered or committed suicide before John wrote this book.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The sixth one, Domitian, who was also murdered, was living when this book was written; therefore, it is said of him that he is.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The other, the seventh, who will be Antichrist, had not yet come at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When he comes, he must remain a little while and then will be slain and resuscitated with the spirit of the fifth, Nero, to be the eighth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 11 says, And the beast who was, and is not, he also is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goes into destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Antichrist will be the coming seventh Caesar.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But he also is the eighth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to 13:3, Antichrist will be slain and resuscitated.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In that resuscitation, the spirit of Nero, the fifth Caesar, which comes up out of the abyss, will animate the dead body of the seventh Caesar, Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This one, composed of the fifth and seventh Caesars, is the eighth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, he is of the seven.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is no wonder people will marvel at the sight of such an extraordinary being v. 8 .</S>
