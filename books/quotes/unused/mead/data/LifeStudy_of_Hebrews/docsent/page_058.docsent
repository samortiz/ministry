   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. A MUTUAL REST FOR GOD AND MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When God rested on the seventh day, Adam also rested.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Likewise, when God has no rest, man has no rest either.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In John chapter four, the Lord Jesus was laboring because He was hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Moreover, both He and the Samaritan woman were thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Was there any rest there?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No, there was no rest because man had not yet been gained by God for His expression and representation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Not until man has been gained by God to express and represent Him can God and man have rest.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If in the church life today all the brothers and the sisters go their own way and no one goes God s way, there will be no rest, even if we come together in a very active way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In such a case, there is not the wonderful church life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church life is a life in which man is gained by God on earth for His expression and representation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When this situation appears, we all shall be in the rest, because God will be satisfied to see Himself expressed and represented through a group of human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whenever this happens on earth so many angels in heaven will be rejoicing for God s satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How do we know when God is satisfied and at rest?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We know it because our spirit is satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now we know the real meaning of the Sabbath rest: it is the satisfaction of God with man in having gained man to express and represent Him on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever such a situation appears, that is the Sabbath, and both God and man are satisfied and rested.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the Sabbath rest.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A PROPHECY OF THE REMAINING SABBATH REST</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In type, this Sabbath rest was the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In actuality, however, this rest was not realized by the children of Israel when they entered into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, the psalmist prophesied of a remaining Sabbath rest for God s people Psa 95:7-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The book of Hebrews quotes Psalm 95 concerning the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What is this Sabbath rest?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In principle, it is the situation in which man is gained by God to express and represent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This situation did not come into being until the church came into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE CHURCH LIFE AS GOD S SABBATH</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In a positive and good sense, the proper church life is God s Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now we can understand why the book of Hebrews warns the believers not to miss the Sabbath, telling them to be diligent to enter into it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What is this Sabbath?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The writer seems to be saying, O Hebrew believers, don t go back to keep the old Sabbath, That is past.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the Psalms God prophesied of another day, the remaining Sabbath rest.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you read chapters three and four of Hebrews carefully, you will find this promise of the remaining Sabbath rest.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These two chapters speak of another day.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This another day is Today 3:7, 13, 15; 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This another day, Today, is the promised Sabbath rest that remains for us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The writer seemed to be saying, Hebrew believers, don t be foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Sabbath rest that God kept in Genesis 2 has been destroyed and will never occur again.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the Psalms, God has assigned another day, Today.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the remaining Sabbath rest for you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You must enter into it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What is this Sabbath rest?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Firstly, it is the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must enter into the church life so that God may be expressed and represented on earth today, be satisfied, and find rest.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When this happens, God and we shall have our Sabbath rest.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we do not get into the proper church life, we shall miss the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, as we shall see, this is not altogether the meaning of the Sabbath rest in Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Matthew 11:28-29 the Lord said, Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many Christians understand this verse in a very superficial way, thinking that it means they will find comfort whenever they are heavy laden and come to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although this may work for you the first time, it may not work after that.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you just take the Lord as your rest according to your natural, selfish concept, the Lord will eventually turn His face away from you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Many Christians experienced this kind of comfort at the beginning of their Christian life only to find that it did not work well later on.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Because Christ is not our life and rest for our individual enjoyment but for the building up of God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you want to enjoy Christ as your rest, you must come to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But where is He?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Where do we go to meet Him?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must come to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The rest, which is Christ Himself, is in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Why is this rest in the church?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Because in the church God is expressed and represented, and where God is expressed and represented, there is the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you do not believe this, try to take your own way and pray to Christ for comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you stay away from the church, you will probably find yourself unable to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Today there is only one good land the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Today s church is the good land because in the church God has His habitation for His expression and representation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God s throne, kingdom, and government are in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Thus, it is in the church that God is satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If He is not satisfied there, then where is He satisfied?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There is only one situation that can satisfy God: a situation in which a group of people has been gained by Him to be His expression and representation.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The angels do not have this privilege because they have not been ordained to express and represent God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But we have been destined and ordained to express and represent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Therefore, God s satisfaction and rest are in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Although many Christians are truly saved, they are not in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Likewise, many of the children of Israel were saved at the time of the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They struck the blood, ate the lamb, came out of Egypt, crossed the Red Sea, and were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But how many of them came into the rest?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Very few.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In like manner, although there are so many real Christians, those who have been truly saved, very few are in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Do you believe that all Christians are in the good land?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>No, many are wandering, and others still remain in Egypt, doing such worldly things as going to the movies.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Since they have believed in the Lord Jesus, we cannot say that they have not been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>However, they are in Egypt or in the wilderness, not in the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We need to be diligent to press on to enter into the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Where is our rest today?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It is in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>THE CHURCH LIFE AS THE HIGH GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>God is not the only one who desires to rest in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>So many unbelieving human beings are wandering, dissatisfied with their way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This is why we need to have the proper and high church life, the church life that will be the high gospel for the thirsty ones.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This is not a matter of having a Sunday morning eleven o clock service; it must be the proper church life in which God and man are satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>When the hungry and thirsty ones come to such a church life, they will see that this is what they have been looking for, that this is what they desire, and immediately they will enter into the Sabbath rest.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>All the believers as well must endeavor to enter into this rest.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>But today the book of Hebrews is closed to most Christians, and no one will touch it.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We all must realize that the book of Hebrews is a part of the full gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Let me say what is on my heart: I want to encourage all the young brothers and sisters to go to the campuses to preach the gospel according to the book of Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>They need to go and preach this high gospel for the proper human life.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>When I was preaching the gospel years ago, my favorite messages were on the meaning of life, vanity, and drinking at the fountain of life.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>On New Year s Day in 1932, I preached on the subject of vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>After preaching for only twenty minutes, so many people stood up even before I had finished my call because I had touched their inward feeling, the feeling of vanity in their life, the vanity in their being.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Although I did not preach very much on sin, eventually everyone repented of his sin.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Oh, we must go to the thirsty people, to the hungry people, and preach the high gospel of the church life that can satisfy the hunger and thirst in their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The church life must be today s Sabbath rest, the good land flowing with milk and honey.</S>
