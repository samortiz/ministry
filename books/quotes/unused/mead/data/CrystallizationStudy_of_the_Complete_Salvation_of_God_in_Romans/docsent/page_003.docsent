   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The burden of this crystallization-study on the complete salvation of God in Romans can be summarized with the following four statements:</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's complete salvation is based upon His righteousness and through our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By the two divine transfers: out of Adam into Christ and out of the flesh into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the one spiritual union of the Spirit of life with our spirit, forming a mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For us to reign in life by the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I hope that our entire being with our living will be occupied by these four statements, which are actually one long sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I. CARRIED OUT ON AND BROUGHT INTO</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE BELIEVERS BY THE POWER OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The complete salvation of God in the book of Romans is carried out on and brought into the believers of Christ by the power of God through His complete gospel Rom 1:16, 1 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Power of God in Romans 1:16 denotes a powerful force that can break through any obstacle.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This power is the resurrected Christ Himself, who is the life-giving Spirit, and it is unto salvation to every one who believes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The gospel of God, as the subject of Romans, concerns Christ as the Spirit living within the believers after His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is higher and more subjective than what was presented in the Gospels, which concern Christ only in the flesh as He lived among His disciples after His incarnation but before His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This book, however, reveals that Christ has resurrected and has become the life-giving Spirit 8:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is no longer merely the Christ outside the believers, but He is now the Christ within them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, the gospel in this book is the gospel of the One who is now indwelling His believers as their subjective Savior.</S>
