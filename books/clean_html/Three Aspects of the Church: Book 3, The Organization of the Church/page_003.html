<h2 class="head1">THE BIBLICAL VIEW CONCERNING<br />
THE ORGANIZATION OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Strictly speaking, the Bible does not use the phrase <em>the organization of the church</em>. This is because the church is not actually an organization. According to spiritual truth, it is wrong to say that the church is an organization. Nonetheless, due to the limitation of human understanding, it is necessary to use the term <em>organization</em> so that we can properly explain the church. Hence, according to spiritual fact, the church is not an organization, yet for the purpose of explanation and clarification, it seems necessary to use the term <em>organization.</em></p>
<p>Although the church is not an organization, it is a living Body, an organism. Therefore, it has an aspect of organization. A body is an organism, an organic entity, whereas a table is not. A table is made by joining many individual pieces of wood together. It is merely an organization. On the other hand, our body is an organism. Nonetheless, it resembles an organization because outwardly speaking, our body has a structure composed of sinews, joints, blood, flesh, and other elements that have been joined together.</p>
<p>The Bible clearly reveals that the church is the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23). Although a physical body looks like an organization, the most important characteristic of a body is not its organization but the life within. A mere organization has no life within. For example, both a table and a building are organizations. Regardless of size, they have no life within. A body, on the contrary, is not a mere organization, because it has life within.</p>
<p>Since the church is the Body, its main characteristic is not organization but life. Once the life in a body stops functioning, it becomes a dead organization. To speak bluntly, when the life within a body is gone, what remains is merely a corpse, and a corpse is merely an organization. An organism depends on life. An entity that has life within is not only an organization but also an organism. An entity without life is merely an organization and has none of the activities related to life. The reason we say that the church is an organism is because it has life. The church is the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>In appearance both a physical body and the church seem to be organizations. However, just as a body is composed of different members, the church as an organism is composed of many living parts. An organism consists not merely of a single part but of many parts. If we speak of the Body of Christ without referring to our physical body, it will be difficult for us to understand the church. A body is a single organism, yet it has many parts, many constituents, which are mutually joined together. We cannot say that a body does not have organization; however, it is inaccurate to say that a body is merely an organization. The church is an organism with many parts and constituents coordinated and organized together.</p>
<p>Not only does the Bible say that the church is the Body; it also says that the church is a household, a temple of God, and the dwelling place of God (2:19-22). There is an aspect of organization in regard to a body and even more in regard to a house. A house is constructed of many parts and elements; hence, it is an organization. However, the church as a house is not a dead house but a living house. Every stone in a physical building is dead because stones lack life, but every stone in the church is living because these stones have life. First Peter 2:4-5 says, &ldquo;Coming to Him, a living stone, rejected by men but with God chosen and precious, you yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house.&rdquo; The Lord Himself is a living stone, and all of us saved ones are living stones. We are living stones because we have Christ&rsquo;s life in us. We are joined together not merely through outward coordination and arrangement but by inward union and growth in life.</p>
<p>Not only are a person&rsquo;s arms and shoulders connected together, but they also share the same life and the same circulation of blood. In other words, they are not only connected but have also grown together. Glass windows can be installed in a house, but the different parts of the church cannot be installed; instead, they grow together into the church. Nevertheless, we cannot deny the fact that the church has an aspect of organization.</p>
<p>Although the Bible does not use the word <em>organization,</em> it often uses related expressions. For instance, Matthew 16:18 uses the word <em>build.</em> The Lord wants to build His church on Himself as the rock. Ephesians 2:22 says that the saved ones are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit. Building is something organizational. Without being organized, big piles of wood and stone cannot become a building. After being organized, a piece of wood is located on top of another piece of wood, and a stone is located on top of another stone. This means that they are built. This is why we say that a building is something that involves organization.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when we go to a local church, we may sense that there is a heap of stones piled up. We may have the feeling that the brothers and sisters have not been built together. In other words, they have not passed through spiritual organization. When we visit another local church, we may sense that some of the brothers and sisters are being built together and have some spiritual organization. Others, however, may be like stones being piled up next to the house. They are for the building of the house, but they have not yet been built into the house. In other words, some saints in the church have not yet passed through spiritual organization.</p>
<p>Furthermore, even though the Bible does not speak of organization in relation to the church, it does speak of blending, or coordination. As to the church being a house, it is a building; as to the church being the Body, it is a blending. First Corinthians 12:24 speaks of the Body of Christ and uses our human body as a metaphor. It says, &ldquo;God has blended the body together.&rdquo; Since this is a blending, or coordination, it certainly involves organization. God organizes everyone whom He blends together. When we come into the midst of some local churches, we cannot sense a condition of coordination; rather, we sense that what exists is a bunch of people coming together. They are not in confusion, but neither are they in coordination. This means that they have not been coordinated together, or organized, by God.</p>
<p>However, when we come into the midst of saints in another local church, we may sense their spiritual organization, that is, the blending carried out by God, and a beautiful order. This differs from a locality in which all the saints are scattered. In such a locality the saints may not argue or quarrel with one another but neither are they related to each other. Thus, <em>blending</em> is the spiritual term, whereas <em>organization</em> is the human term.</p>
<p>There is yet a third term that the Bible uses&mdash;<em>placed.</em> First Corinthians 12:28 says that what God has placed in the church is not merely one type of person but many types of people. Some are apostles, some are prophets, some are teachers, some are helpers, and some are administrators (v. 28). God has placed all these different types of people in the church. To use words that we can more easily understand, to be placed means to be organized. God&rsquo;s placing is His arrangement, and an arrangement is an organization. The gifted ones do not serve in a disorganized way, each doing his own thing. The apostles, prophets, and teachers do not serve independently. They do not speak their own thing. God&rsquo;s placing is orderly. In 1 Corinthians 12:28 there is a specific order. First there are apostles, second there are prophets, and third there are teachers. This is very orderly.</p>
