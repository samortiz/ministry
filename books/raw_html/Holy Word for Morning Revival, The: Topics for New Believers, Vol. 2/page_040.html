 <p><strong>WEEK 13 &mdash; DAY 4</strong></p>
<h2 class="head3u">Scripture Reading</h2>
<p><strong>Matt. 13:31-33 ...The kingdom of the heavens is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field, <em>and</em> which is smaller than all the seeds; but when it has grown, it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and roost in its branches. Another parable He spoke to them: The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.</strong></p>
<h2 class="head2"><em>The Three Aspects of<br />
the Kingdom of the Heavens</em> (continued)</h2>
<p>[Following the parable of the tares,] the second item in the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is [revealed in the parable of the] mustard [seed] growing abnormally into a tree (Matt. 13:31-32). Mustard is an herb, not a tree.<sup>250</sup> The church, which is the embodiment of the kingdom, should be like an herb that produces food. However, its nature and function were changed, so that it became a &ldquo;tree,&rdquo; a lodging place for birds. (This is against the law of God&rsquo;s creation, that is, that every plant must be after its kind&mdash;Gen. 1:11-12.) This change happened in the first part of the fourth century, when Constantine the Great mixed the church with the world. He brought thousands of false believers into Christianity, making it Christendom, no longer the church....The mustard is an annual herb, whereas the tree is a perennial plant. The church, according to its heavenly and spiritual nature, should be like the mustard, sojourning on the earth. But with its nature changed, the church became deeply rooted and settled as a tree in the earth, flourishing with its enterprises as the branches in which many evil persons and things are lodged. This resulted in the formation of the outward organization of the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>Since the birds in the first parable signify the evil one, Satan (Matt. 13:4, 19), the birds of heaven [in verse 32] must refer to Satan&rsquo;s evil spirits with the evil persons and things motivated by them. They lodge in the branches of the great tree, that is, in the enterprises of Christendom.<sup>251</sup></p>
<p>The third item in the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is [revealed in the parable of] leaven taken by a woman and hidden in three measures of meal (Matt. 13:33).<sup>252</sup> In the Scriptures leaven signifies evil things (1 Cor. 5:6-8) and evil doctrines (Matt. 16:6, 11-12).<sup>253</sup> What is leaven? Leaven is something which is added to flour to make the bread enjoyable and easy to take.<sup>254</sup> Once the flour is leavened there is no way to purge it, no way to purify it. We all must realize that we are still under a certain kind or a certain extent of leavening. All the truths we have heard and received in the past have been leavened by the enemy.<sup>255</sup></p>
<p>The church as the practical kingdom of the heavens, with Christ, the unleavened fine flour, as its content, must be a loaf of unleavened bread (1 Cor. 5:7-8). However, the Catholic Church, which was fully and officially formed in the sixth century and which is signified by the woman [in Matthew 13:33], took in many pagan practices, heretical doctrines, and evil matters and mixed them with the teachings concerning Christ, leavening the whole content of Christianity. This mixture became the corrupted content of the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>Meal, for making the meal offering (Lev. 2:1), signifies Christ as food to both God and man. Three measures is the quantity needed to make a full meal (Gen. 18:6). Hence, the hiding of the leaven in three measures of meal signifies that the Catholic Church has fully leavened in a hidden way all the teachings concerning Christ. This is the actual situation in the Roman Catholic Church. Such leavening is absolutely against the Scriptures, which strongly forbid putting any leaven into the meal offering (Lev. 2:4-5, 11).<sup>256</sup></p>
<p>Whereas everything in Matthew 5, 6, and 7 is real, pure, spiritual, and heavenly, everything shown in Matthew 13 is false, corrupt, mixed, and abnormal.<sup>257</sup></p>
