   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FROM A LOWER TO A HIGHER FORM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Stated in a simple and brief way, Jesus was God incarnated to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then He was crucified and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By crucifixion and resurrection, He was transfigured from a lower to a higher form.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For example, suppose we have a seed with life in it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The form is low, but if the seed is sown in the earth, it grows, through decay and death, from a lower degree to a higher see 1 Cor 15:37, 42, 43 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was a seed, but now it has become a flower.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The form of the seed is lower, while the stage of the flower is much higher.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was the same with Jesus when He was in the flesh before His crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His form was low, but by His crucifixion and resurrection, His form became higher, yet it still remained the same nature.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The nature and essence was the same, but the form was different.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He was flesh before His crucifixion, and He was still flesh after His crucifixion Luke 24:39 , but the form had changed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He did not through death and resurrection relinquish His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He still retained the flesh, but in a higher, resurrected form.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then from this resurrected and ascended Jesus, the Spirit of Jesus came forth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whatever is in Jesus, and whatever He has obtained and attained, are now all in this Spirit of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Suppose we have a teapot full of tea from which we pour a cup of tea.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Obviously, whatever is in the teapot will be exactly the same as what is in the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The tea in the cup is the same as that in the teapot.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Spirit of Jesus came forth from the very resurrected and ascended Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By this we realize that today the Spirit of Jesus has not only the divine essence, but also the human essence of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is not only divinity, but also humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must consider who this "Me" is in Jesus' words: "If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is not just the divine Person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is a man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, when we come to Jesus to drink of Him, we come to drink of this man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We drink not only of His divinity, but even the more of His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Tea has an abundance of water in it; but we do not call it water, we call it tea.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE NATURAL CONCEPT</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I am afraid that many of us still think that whenever we come to Jesus to drink of Him, we drink of Him only as a divine Person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Few Christians today have the concept that when they drink of Jesus, they are not only drinking of a divine Person, but also of a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They are not drinking only of the divinity of Jesus, but even the more of His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I have seen many who have received the so-called Pentecostal experience with the manifestation of gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The strange thing was that in their daily life there was no flow of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the meetings, they spoke frequently in tongues and exercised many of the gifts, but when they were in their homes, the flowing of life was missing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For many years I have been observing this situation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Of course, concerning those who love the world and do not care for the Lord's interest, it is understandable that they do not have the flow of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But what is the reason why those who are so much in the manifestation of the gifts do not have it?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I believe the answer is in John 7.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To have the flow of life, we all must drink of the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must drink not only of the Spirit of God, but of the Spirit of an exalted Person, the Spirit of an exalted Man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our understanding is that we drink only of the Spirit of God, but this is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we drink only water, we are still short of tea.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today we need to drink some "tea."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to drink of the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to drink of the resurrected and ascended man, Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is not only the Spirit of God, but also the Spirit of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The bountiful supply is not of the Spirit of God, but of the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 .</S>
