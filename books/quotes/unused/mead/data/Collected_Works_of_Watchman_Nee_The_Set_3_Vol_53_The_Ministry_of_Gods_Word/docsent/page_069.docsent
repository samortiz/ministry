   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Speaking according to the Words of the Scripture</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In preparing the outer words, we have to pay attention to the words of the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we have the inner words and try to release them to others, we often find that we are short of words.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For the most part, we aim our utterance in a particular direction and exhaust our words in a few minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The inner words are very condensed and compact.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our own utterance is not adequate to release such condensed and compact words.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we repeat the same word once, twice, or ten times, others will be bored by our speaking; they will not appreciate it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our speaking may be very concise, but it is ineffectual.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A man realizes the shortage of his own eloquence when he tries to be a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He can talk about many things, but as soon as he talks about spiritual things, he finds that he can do very little.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He runs out of resources in no time, while the inner words remain unreleased.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He can release his own words, but the inner words remain locked up.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the reason that we have to be familiar with the words of the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God uses us as His ministers of the word, yet He knows that our utterance is limited.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, He spoke to us in many portions and in many ways Heb 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the most, our thoughts can be expressed one way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But God has spoken to us in many portions and in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is why we have to be familiar with the words of the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to spend time to study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>During our study, we are equipped with biblical doctrines, knowledge, and teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our speaking must be founded upon the Bible; it must be supported by biblical teachings and biblical truths.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These things afford God's children a means and a basis for accepting our words.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After we have received light, thoughts, and the words, we may discover that a few portions of the Scripture identically match the revelation we have received and that many things in these portions are similar to our revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should make a note of these few portions and verbalize the word we received from God with repeated reference to these portions of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Perhaps the word that we received from God is only a few sentences long or at most a dozen sentences long.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But we can draw from our experience in the Word to utter the speaking that is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This utterance, though short, will pierce men's hearts and enlighten their understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the reason that we have to be familiar with the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to use the words of the Bible to facilitate our utterance of the revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is not to expound the Bible in an objective way but to explain it in a subjective way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are not presenting an exegesis; we are conveying the revelation which we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are using the Scripture only because that particular portion of the Word matches our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because Peter's words, John's words, the words of Genesis, or the words of the Psalms match the things we are about to speak, we can use them to present our point.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should ponder how Paul spoke on this subject and how Peter spoke on the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should ponder how David or Moses spoke on the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As we ponder, we should consider how the Lord wants us to speak on the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These men spoke on the subject in their own way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now we have to mold our word, the very word that we have received from God, according to their words.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have to do this in all sorts of ways.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The revelation and light we received, the burden and responsibility we have from God, form the basis of our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we repeat the subject over and over again with our own words, the inner words will be released.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Light will shine and the burden will be discharged.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our study of the Bible should not be for exegesis only.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A mere exegesis of the Bible is vain.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The words of the Bible are given for us to release the burden within us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Without these words, we could not enunciate our burden.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Words from the Bible discharge our burden.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There may be five, ten, or twenty different portions of the Word that can accomplish this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One portion is not enough to release our burden; we have to release our burden in a variety of ways.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Suppose we have a burden within, and we try to discharge it through one portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must ask ourselves whether or not our burden is discharged after the application of just one passage.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If our burden is still heavy, we may have to use a few more passages to discharge it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But if the burden is not that strong, fewer passages may suffice.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>After we have found the right passages, we must first try to relieve our burden one way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If the burden remains in us, we should try to relieve it another way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Perhaps we have to use five different passages before our burden is fully released.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The ministry of the word is related to the release of the inner word, the weighty word of God, through the release of the words of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In speaking for God, we must lay hold of the best tool the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Yet we must issue this warning: The Bible alone is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The mere letter of the Bible is only doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The basis of the ministry of the word is revelation; it is the inner word.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, when this word is released, it must be released through the words of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If a man lacks inner revelation yet immerses himself in pure Bible exposition, his activity will remain on a very low plane.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We cannot borrow Paul's riches and count them as our own.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We have to see something ourselves and speak according to what we have seen before we can have the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We must have revelation, the word, and the Scripture before we can speak.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we only have the word within, but not the Bible without, we cannot speak.</S>
