   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT TRUMPETING THE ONENESS AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>LIVING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>While I was in Houston for the Chinese-speaking conference, I got quite a burden for the Chinese population, especially the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It seems there is very little light; the sky is cloudy, foggy, and smoggy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I have heard that there are between twenty-five and thirty thousand Chinese in the Houston area.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Most of these have come within the last ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even among such a small population, there are some twenty-five to thirty Christian groups.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It seems anyone is free and has the right to set up a group.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I heard of a division that happened because a small number in a group wanted to put more emphasis on preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the others in the group were not in agreement, those concerned about the gospel left and formed their own group.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was so easy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It seems there is no one to trumpet the oneness of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I also have the impression from what I have heard that the activities of some of these Christian groups are mainly social.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Probably a number of their attendants are not even saved.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In such a place the church must be very strong and shining.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must blow the trumpet that the Body of Christ is one and that in any locality the expression of this Body as the church must also be one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is no excuse for Christians to be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Brothers, we ourselves need to learn, and then we need to train the saints in the recovery, how to preach this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must point out that Christians should not be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Any division big or small, old or new is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Catholicism, denominations, and free groups are all divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must condemn division.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But it is unwise to make a point of saying, without an adequate explanation to people, that only we who are on the local church ground are the churches and all who are not on this ground are not churches.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should avoid any talk that makes the sky cloudy by stirring up argument.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must learn to present the truth in a clear and prevailing way, leaving no loophole for the other side to argue or reject.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In presenting the truth, our understanding, expression, and wording must be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should have long talks with outsiders about the oneness of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From Matthew 16:18 on to the book of Revelation we can point out that the church should be one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Upon this oneness we can challenge their divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Can they justify division?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Why were they meeting with some others a short time ago and now there is a split?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Why didn t they stay with that group?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The church in Houston could even write a tract along this line and have the saints distribute it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Mail it as well.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What is the use of vain complaining about divisions?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You brothers, especially those from Houston, should do something.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Chinese saints in the church should do something.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Pray together and write a tract.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You may even print some posters and put them up in places where it is allowed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A TWOFOLD TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What I saw and heard during the Chinese-speaking conference surely confirms my concern; that is, the recovery of the Lord must be strong and shining in two things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One is that the recovery is a recovery of God s genuine expression.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The other is the excellency of Christ His superiority, His glory, His riches, and His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These are not superficial truths.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Brothers, as the leading ones in the local churches, you all need to get into these truths, experience them, and be trained to preach them to others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But this presenting of the deeper truths must be common to all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Not only the elders can do it; even the sisters can.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must endeavor to take care of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The New Testament shows us that all the believers are lights in the world Phil 2:15 and that every local church is a lampstand Rev 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Wherever we are, we should shine.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Individually and collectively we should shine.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The sky is dark because the light doesn t shine.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>No matter how small our number is, even if there are only ten, our locality should be enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Just to meet on the ground, to pray in the spirit, and to live in the spirit I feel is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must also sound the trumpet and shine forth the light.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the early years of the Lord s recovery in China, the trumpet was loud; the testimony was clear.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There was an atmosphere of spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We were opposed, but the opposers could not deny that we had a high standard of spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Though our numbers were small, we brought such an atmosphere into the community.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must live a life full of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When we say division is wrong, there should be weight to our words; the divisive ones should be able to see that we do have a measure of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We are not speaking lightly, vainly.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They know that we have given up the world and rejected ourselves and that we live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must be a living testimony; we should not be so quiet and so lacking in influence.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should be spiritually contagious.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Paul, you know, was accused of being a pestilent fellow Acts 24:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Jews implied that wherever he went, pestilence followed!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I feel that Houston has no pestilence !</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You brothers in Houston, especially the Chinese, should be a strong pestilence.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Go out to spread the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>At the same time, you should live a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This testimony is the testimony of Jesus; it is the embodiment of the Triune God; it is the lampstand.</S>
