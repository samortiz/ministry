<h2 class="head2">D. Not Letting the Stumbling Block of the Cross<br />Be Done Away</h2><p>In 5:11 Paul says, &ldquo;But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? Then has the stumbling block of the cross been done away.&rdquo; Circumcision foreshadowed the dealing with man&rsquo;s flesh; the cross is the reality of this dealing (Col. 2:11-12). The Judaizers endeavored to bring the Galatians back to the shadow; the Apostle Paul struggled to keep them in the reality.</p><p>Circumcision is a type of the cross of Christ. In typology, circumcision typifies the cutting off of the flesh. The true cutting off of the flesh is accomplished by the cross. Therefore, the cross is the fulfillment and the reality of the type of circumcision. Nevertheless, the Judaizers insisted on continuing the practice of circumcision, even though Christ had been crucified on the cross. Because the Judaizers insisted on circumcision and opposed the cross, they persecuted those, like Paul, who preached the cross of Christ. Paul taught that circumcision was a type, a shadow, fulfilled in the cross of Christ. Since Christ has been crucified, there is no longer any need for the practice of circumcision.</p><p>According to 5:11, Paul would not preach circumcision and thereby allow the stumbling block of the cross to be done away. Even by the time the book of Galatians was written, between A.D. 55 and 58, the cross of Christ had already become a stumbling block. Some did not dare to believe in the cross or to talk about it. This was due to the influence of Judaism, where circumcision was of great importance. The Judaizers belittled the cross and exalted circumcision. To them, the cross of Christ was a stumbling block, and those who preached the word of the cross deserved to be persecuted. Thus, verse 11 helps us to realize the situation when Paul wrote to the Galatians.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Letting the Troubling and Upsetting Ones<br />Bear the Judgment and Cut Themselves Off</h2><p>In verses 10 and 12 Paul has some strong words concerning those who were troubling the Galatian believers. In verse 10 he says that &ldquo;he who troubles you shall bear the judgment, whoever he may be.&rdquo; This word is virtually the equivalent of a curse. Paul was saying that those who troubled the saints in Galatia would be cursed. Paul used the word &ldquo;cursed&rdquo; in chapter one, where he says that anyone who preaches a gospel besides that which the Galatians received should be accursed (1:9). Here Paul says that the one who troubles the Galatians will be judged, condemned, whoever he may be.</p><p>In 5:12 Paul utters a very strong word: &ldquo;I would that those who upset you would even cut themselves off.&rdquo; The Apostle Paul wished that the Judaizers who upset the Galatians by insisting on circumcision would cut off not only their foreskin but even themselves. Their upsetting, disturbing self needed to be amputated.</p><p>The fact that Paul wanted those who upset the Galatian believers to &ldquo;cut themselves off&rdquo; indicates that he regarded them as flesh that needed to be cut. Paul was saying, &ldquo;Those who are disturbing you should not simply cut off a piece of flesh from their bodies&mdash;they should cut themselves off.&rdquo; In the eyes of God, the whole being of such ones is under condemnation and worthy to be cut off. The Judaizers must have been angered by such a word, angered enough to put Paul to death. How bold Paul was to utter such a word concerning them, treating them as flesh! When Paul was bold, he was really bold. Here we see his boldness in speaking of the Judaizers as flesh needing to be cut off.</p><h2 class="head1">II. NOT TURNING FREEDOM<br />INTO AN OCCASION FOR THE FLESH</h2><p>In 5:13 Paul says, &ldquo;For you were called to freedom, brothers; only do not turn the freedom into an occasion for the flesh, but through love serve one another as slaves.&rdquo; Paul&rsquo;s writing is not like an unturned cake (Hosea 7:8). Rather, he is balanced and even, first considering one side of a matter, then the other side. Our tendency, however, is to be an unturned cake, with one side raw and the other side overdone. In giving messages we may easily produce unturned cakes. But as Paul wrote the book of Galatians, he turned the cake again and again. He could be strong, then affectionate; rebuking, then mild.</p><p>We see Paul&rsquo;s balance in the matter of freedom. On the one hand, Paul tells us that we were called to freedom; on the other hand, he warns us not to use this freedom for an occasion for the flesh. While Paul encouraged the believers to enjoy their freedom in Christ, he was also concerned that they might misuse or abuse this freedom. If we over-indulge ourselves in our freedom, then we turn it into an occasion for the flesh. Although we are free, we still need to be limited in the exercise of our freedom. Freedom without limitation always results in the indulgence of the flesh. Therefore, we need to be balanced, to be free, yet restricted. If we are limited in the use of our freedom, we shall love others and through love serve them as slaves.</p><p>When Paul wrote the book of Galatians, he had a number of thoughts within him. He realized that the Galatian believers who had been distracted might return to their freedom and then begin to misuse it. They might have the attitude that since they are no longer under any kind of yoke, they are free to do what they please. Such an attitude damages the church life. Therefore, Paul charged the Galatians not to misuse their freedom. Yes, they had been called to freedom, but they should not turn it into an indulgence. On the one hand, they were free from the yoke of slavery, from the law, but, on the other hand, they should still care for others and serve them in love. When some saints, especially young believers, hear a message on freedom, they have the tendency to cast off restraint. They may have the attitude that, since they are free, no longer do they need to regard the word of the elders. This is to turn freedom into an occasion for the flesh. Instead of doing this, we should be limited in the use of freedom and be willing to serve one another as slaves. As Paul says in 5:14, &ldquo;The whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>In the verses we have covered in this message, Paul admonishes us to have a proper walk in the church life. He indicates that we need to be balanced and not be unturned cakes. In giving messages, we should cover both sides of a matter. We need to care for ourselves and also for others. We may enjoy the freedom we have and yet still be restricted in love for the sake of others that the church life may go on in a good way. Furthermore, we must learn not to be otherwise minded. Then we shall have a proper walk in the church life.</p>
