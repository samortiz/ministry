   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEUTRAL MIND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we need to consider these matters in more detail.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What does it mean to mind the things of the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And what does it mean to set the mind on certain things?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In these verses there are the mind, the flesh, and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Of course the flesh is something negative and very black.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The spirit is very positive and very white.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In between these two is the mind which is neutral and gray.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The flesh could never be neutral.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is always black; it could never be gray.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In like manner the spirit is always white; it could never be gray or neutral.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the mind in between these two sometimes turns to black and sometimes turns to white.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is neutral.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The mind is something turning all the day long.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What is the difference between minding and setting the mind?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may consider that both of these are green: one is light green, and the other is dark green.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Minding the spirit is light green, while setting the mind on the spirit is dark green.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means minding is not so strong as setting the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Setting the mind is much stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Romans 8 the mind is set either on the flesh or on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Where then is the neutral mind?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The neutral mind is found in Romans 7:25.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There Paul says, With the mind I myself serve as a slave the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The mind in this verse is a kind of independent mind, subject neither to the flesh nor to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may consider that independent mind as being in the color of gray.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is neutral.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many Christians have such a neutral mind.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The neutral mind will just make you a wretched man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It will make you a miserable, pitiful man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The neutral mind in chapter seven is not bad; it serves the law.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But the mind in 8:7 which is set on the flesh is against the law.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In other words in 7:25 there is a gray mind, but in 8:7 there is a black mind.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now the question is: How to make your mind black?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Or how to make your mind white?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It all depends what you set your mind on.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you set your mind on the flesh, you make your mind black.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you set your mind on the spirit, you make your mind white.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Not many can have a gray or a neutral mind.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is not so easy to keep your mind independent.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How can we practice setting the mind on the spirit so that we will have a white mind?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to realize that the beginning of the setting is the minding.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First, we mind the things of the spirit, and then we set the mind on the things of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>MAKING THE MIND ONE WITH THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Let us also read another verse, Ephesians 4:23: And are being renewed in the spirit of your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Here the spirit becomes the spirit of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>No doubt this means that the spirit becomes one with your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This tells us that our mind can be one with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>And our spirit can be the spirit of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Actually, such a mind with which the spirit is one is a mind set on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This means to set the mind on the spirit is just to have or to make your mind one with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Ephesians 4, it speaks of the spirit of the mind for renewing, and in Romans 8 it speaks of the mind of the spirit for interceding.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>How can you make your mind one with the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>By constantly minding the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In other words, how can you make the light green darker?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>By coloring it again and again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>By adding more color, the light green becomes darker.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>By minding the spirit again and again, your mind is eventually set on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In other words, it makes your mind one with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For many years I have been trying to practice being spiritual and to find a way or a secret to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A number of books have been written by Christian teachers telling people how to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After many years of experience I would say that the way to be spiritual is to set your mind on the spirit, making your mind one with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When your mind is one with the spirit, you are spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When you set your mind on the spirit, making your mind one with the spirit, it is at that time that you are really in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This can be proved by two verses on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Verse 7 speaks of the mind set on the flesh, and verse 8 speaks of those who are in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This indicates that if you set your mind on the flesh, you make yourself to be in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If you mind the flesh or set your mind upon the flesh, you are in the flesh.</S>
