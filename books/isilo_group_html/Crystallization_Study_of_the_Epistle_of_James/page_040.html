Here a hidden mixture is implied: a mixture of the regenerated persons in their regenerated humanity mingled with divinity, with the natural persons in their fallen humanity, in the producing and carrying out of the virtues of Christian perfection. In the church as the organic Body of Christ everything must be done by the regenerated persons, in whom is God's delight, and nothing should be done by the natural persons, for whom is God's condemnation.</li>	</ol><li>The tragic issues of James's mistake:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>The blinding of thousands of believers:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>From James's time to today.</li>		<li>From seeing the clear view concerning the economy of God that they may participate in the producing and building up of the Body of Christ as a precursor of the New Jerusalem.</li>		<li>The divine revelation in the Scriptures is progressive in different degrees, and its progression is according to the four different ages of the Scriptures:</li>			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Job's perfection (Job 1:1, 8) was according to the divine revelation of the age before the law, which was Job's goal in seeking after God and replaced God in Job's satisfaction; thus, Job was stripped by God of his perfection.</li>			<li>Saul of Tarsus's perfection (Phil. 3:6) before his salvation was according to the divine revelation in the age of law, which was opposing God's New Testament economy and was rejected by him after his salvation by receiving the vision of the divine revelation of the age of grace.</li>			<li>The perfection stressed by James was according to his vague view of God's divine revelation and was a mixture of the divine revelation according to the age of the law with the divine revelation according to the age of grace.</li>			<li>The genuine perfection is according to the pure vision of God's highest divine revelation of the age of grace and is brought forth by the fullness of the riches of the consummated Triune God and through the crucifixion of the cross of Christ for the bringing forth of the Body of Christ to consummate in the New Jerusalem as God's eternal enlargement and expression.</li>			</ol>		</ol>	<li>The snaring of the top apostle:</li>		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Paul, according to the pure vision of the divine revelation concerning God's eternal economy, rejected the law in Galatians 2:16, 19; 3:2, 5, 10-13; 5:1-4, 18 and condemned the Jewish believers who sinned willfully by going back to Judaism and offering the sacrifices of cattle in Hebrews 10:18, 26.</li>		<li>James persuaded Paul to go back to the law, even to enter into the temple and wait to offer sacrifices for the completion of others' Nazarite vow.</li>		<li>But the Lord did not tolerate it and came into the situation to blow away the whole deal.</li>		<li>However, that snare caused Paul to be arrested and eventually transferred to the prison of Caesar in Rome&#151;Acts 21:18-36; 25:10-12.</li>		</ol>	</ol><li>The wiping out by God:</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>By the thorough destruction of the city of Jerusalem with its temple in A.D. 70, God terminated the Jewish religious service to Him, symbolized by the temple, and the nation of the Jews, symbolized by the city of Jerusalem.</li>	<li>By the destruction of Jerusalem God also wiped out all the vague situation and mixtures among the believers caused by James's vague vision and mistake and separated the believers from the Jewish people and anything Jewish.</li>	</ol></ol><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_039.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_041.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crystallization-Study of the Epistle of James &nbsp; pg 40</div><br></body></html>
