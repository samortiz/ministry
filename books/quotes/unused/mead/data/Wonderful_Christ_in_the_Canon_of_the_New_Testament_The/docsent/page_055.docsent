   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTEEN TAKING CHRIST AS OUR PERSON Scripture Reading: Phil 2:5; 2 Cor 2:10b; 10:1; 11:10; Rom 8:4; Gal 5:25; 2 Cor 3:18 POSITIONED TO DRINK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By the baptism in the Holy Spirit, we were all put into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thus we were put into a position that fits His work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His intention is not merely to put us into Himself, but to put us into Himself for His working within us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After putting us into Himself, He started His work within us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is just like a school.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First of all we are enrolled, then we enter into the school.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The admission into the school is to put us into the position that the school may work on us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First Corinthians 12:13 says that we have all been baptized in one Spirit into one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is to be put into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Also we have all been made to drink of one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that we have all been put into a position to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To put us into Christ is one thing; to make us to drink Christ into us is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The main purpose is not only to put us into Christ, but to get Christ more and more wrought into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What we eat and drink is assimilated into our being and becomes something organic that belongs to our constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Eventually what we drink becomes us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>So to be put into Christ is to be positioned for Christ to work Himself into us day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To enter into school is for at least one semester, but to let the school work on you is a day by day matter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To be put into Christ is a matter once for all, and this has been accomplished through the baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now we are positioned for Christ to be wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is working Himself into us, and He is working by dwelling in us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In a sense He is in us, and in another sense He is getting more into us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is adding Himself into us more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today we may only have a little of Christ, but after two months we may have more of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Day by day He is adding Himself into us and multiplying Himself within us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is why we have both peace and bothering at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have real peace by the indwelling Christ, yet we do not have peace, because He is constantly bothering us!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If there is no bothering and troubling, there is no growth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Praise the Lord that we have all been baptized into Christ and have put on Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is our position and our standing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ is now the indwelling One, constantly working Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>CHRIST THE PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the last chapter, we saw that it pleased God to reveal His Son in us Gal 1:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God has revealed His Son in us!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is a great thing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Next we saw through Galatians 2:20 that we have been crucified with Christ, nevertheless we live, yet it is not we, but Christ who lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is really a strange language.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We live, yet it is not we; it is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is the One living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many Christians know this verse, but I am afraid that they do not see that this verse shows us that Christ is our person.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It does not say that it is no more I, but the life of Christ that lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It says that Christ, the person Himself, lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many Christians take the life of Christ, but they do not take the person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is a big difference.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By itself life does not bother us a great deal, but a person is always a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Marriage is a very good illustration of taking another person.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Marriage is wonderful; however, you not only get a helper, but a person.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Your husband is a person; he is not just a machine to take care of you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If he were a machine, that would not bother you.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But he is a person; so when he takes care of you, he takes care of you in his way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>And his way is not your way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A machine does not have a will.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You can irritate it, and it will never lose its temper because it does not have a temper to lose.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But your husband is a person with feeling, emotion, and temper.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The only way for you not to have any trouble with your husband is for you to take him as your person.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you do this, there is no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Marriage is a big responsibility, because you get a person who gives you a lot of problems.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There is no doubt that we do get help from our wives and husbands, but at the same time there is a real suffering in order to get the help.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The only way is to take your wife or your husband as your person.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then whatever they do will be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is why in all the weddings, Western or Eastern, the wife has a veil to cover her head.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Most people think that this is just a formality, but there is a deep significance.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It means that in marriage there can only be one person; the other one is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There can only be one head; otherwise there will be a divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The main reason for all divorces is the fact that one couple has two heads, two wills, two minds, two emotions, and two persons.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>No wonder they fight!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>One couple must have only one person.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Then there will be peace in the marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If the young people are not ready to take another one as their person, they should forget about marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Otherwise they will suffer.</S>
