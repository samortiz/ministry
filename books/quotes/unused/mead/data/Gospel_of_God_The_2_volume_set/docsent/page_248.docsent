   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MERCY AND JUDGMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We know that our God is a righteous God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the future, at the judgment seat, He will judge us according to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, though there is righteousness at the judgment seat, there is mercy also.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you show mercy to others, the Lord will be merciful to you.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you are unforgiving toward others, and if you are so righteous and unyielding toward others' failures and weaknesses, the Lord will deal with you in righteousness in that day.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you are merciful to others, the Lord will show mercy to you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Luke 6:37 says that if you do not pass sentence on others, sentence will not be passed on you; if you will not judge others, you will not be judged, and if you forgive others, you will be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some Christians are too mean today.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When they criticize others they scrutinize every mistake others make.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When they do their best to criticize and judge others, they have to be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the future God will deal with them in the same way they deal with others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>With what measure you measure to others, it will be measured to you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you give to others good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, the Lord will give to you in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He who forgives will be forgiven, and to him who shows mercy, mercy will be shown.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, the Bible says that mercy triumphs over judgment James 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is one thing which even judgment cannot triumph over a person showing mercy to others throughout his entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We cannot be without mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But if we show mercy to others today, God will be unable to deal with us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many Christians are not able to lose in their dealings with others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They argue all the time with others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They give little ground to others and grant themselves all the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But we should rather show mercy to others today.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the time of judgment comes, there will be some whom even the Lord of judgment will not be able to hold anything against.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This does not mean that man can purposely change God's commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It simply means that if you are merciful to others while you are living on earth, God will be merciful to you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Your mercy today will triumph over your judgment tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The way you judge others will be the way that you will be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This grace is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The way you treat others will be the way that the Lord will treat you.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The way you treat others will fashion for you a vessel, with which God will measure out judgment to you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>James 2:13 says, "For the judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those who show no mercy to others will be judged without mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But those who show mercy to others will triumph over judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Your mercy will surpass the judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is an amazing fact.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Matthew 18 shows us clearly that God's children can still fall into the hand of the torturers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If they do, they will have to remain there until they pay off all their debts.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Of course, there is no way to pay off all the debts.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But at least one day they will learn to be merciful and to forgive others in the same way that the Lord showed mercy to them and forgave them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By then they will still have to show mercy to others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, in verse 35 the Lord says, "So also will My heavenly Father do to you if each of you does not forgive his brother from your hearts."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This portion of the Word is not spoken to unbelievers, but to Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It shows the relationship between the heavenly Father and His children and the relationship between the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Prior to this portion of the Word, Peter asked the Lord, "How often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Up to seven times?"</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Matt 18:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord told him that he should forgive up to seventy times seven.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then the Lord spoke the word about the two slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Peter will face chastisement if he does not forgive his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The word of the Lord shows Peter that there is the possibility that he could be thrown to the torturers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is the possibility that he could be put into prison.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If there is the possibility for Peter to be thrown to the torturers and cast into prison, there is the possibility for us to be treated the same way also.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>That is why the Lord used the plural "you" in verse 35.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>His word is not for Peter only; it is for everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we do not forgive each one of our brothers from our heart, the heavenly Father will do the same to us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Please remember that our eternal salvation in the new heaven and new earth is unshakable.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Thank the Lord that this is by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But if our problems today are not dealt with specifically, we will still suffer specific punishment in the future kingdom.</S>
