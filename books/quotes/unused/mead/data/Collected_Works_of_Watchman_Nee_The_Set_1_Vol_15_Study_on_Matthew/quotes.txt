[2]  After 1931 Brother Watchman Nee led the church in Shanghai in a study of the Gospel of Matthew intermittently for several years.
[3]  This volume consists of notes taken during those studies that were later edited and polished.
[4]  Verse 1: "The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham."
[5]  In the beginning of this chapter, in the first verse, Jesus Christ is mentioned.
[6]  This chapter may be divided into two sections: verses 1-12 are concerned with Herod's plot to kill, and verses 13-23 describe Jesus' flight.
[7]  "The star which they saw" was the same star they saw the first time.
[8]  If we want to know the certainty of God's leading, we need a second revelation of the star after its first revelation.
[9]  This is a principle: the second appearing of the star is a confirmation that its first appearing is correct.
[10]  If we took the first step, yet we do not have "I will show thee" as the second step, we were probably wrong in our first step.
[11]  If one who believes in the Lord is not affected by the Lord in his inward emotions and feelings, he is not worthy to be called a Christian.
[12]  Verses 1-12 give a record of John's preaching of repentance; verses 13-17, of Jesus' being baptized.
[13]  When we come to Matthew 3, a problem arises because of different views concerning the kingdom of the heavens.
[14]  In studying the Word of God, first we must reject our preconceived ideas; second, we must have the Lord's view.
[15]  Concerning the kingdom of the heavens, the Lord promised that it will be revealed to infants Matt 11:25 .
[16]  Matthew 1 and 2 show us that the Lord is related not only to the Jews but also to the Gentiles.
[17]  The millennium consists of two parts: one is the kingdom of the heavens and the other, the kingdom of Messiah.
[18]  The kingdom of the heavens pertains to the Lord's relationship with the believers, which is spiritual; whereas the kingdom of Messiah pertains to the Lord's relationship with the Jews, which is physical.
[19]  1 It has nothing to do with the Jews: "Do not presume to say within yourselves, We have Abraham as our father" v. 9 . 2 It must be an organized entity whereby people can flee from the coming wrath v. 7 . 3 It requires holy and righteous conduct v. 8 . 4 Whoever does not have a relationship with the kingdom of the heavens will be cast into the fire v. 10 . 5 For people to be baptized is for them to believe in the One who is coming v. 11 . Hence, believing in the Lord is the initiation.
[20]  This causes people to stand in the position of sinners.
[21]  Regret is linked to confession, for when a person recognizes his position, spontaneously he will confess his sins.
[22]  Verse 7:"But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, Offspring of vipers, who prompted you to flee from the coming wrath?"
[23]  The Pharisees were self-proclaimed adherents of fundamental doctrines; actually, they were dead.
[24]  On the other hand, the Sadducees did not believe in anything.
[25]  The self-proclaimed fundamentalists believed only in creeds; they did not know the power of God.
[26]  John said that the Lord "will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire" because at that time two groups of people were standing before him: one group belonged to the Lord and the other was not truly seeking the Lord.
[27]  This chapter includes two important things: 1 the Lord's being tempted vv.
[28]  Verse 3:"And the tempter came and said to Him, If You are the Son of God, speak that these stones may become loaves of bread."
[29]  The Lord does not need to prove Himself, because He has God's testimony Matt 3:17 .
[30]  Adam was defeated because he did not do what God had commanded him to do; Christ was victorious because He did not do what God had not commanded Him to do.
[31]  The Lord's answer was completely opposite to Satan's proposal.
[32]  Satan was on one line, but the Lord changed to another line to deal with him.
[33]  In chapter three John the Baptist declared the kingdom of the heavens, in chapter four the Lord proclaimed the kingdom of the heavens, and in chapter five the Lord spoke concerning the law and principle of the kingdom of the heavens.
[34]  Is this portion, Matthew 5 7, spoken to Christians?
[35]  1 In verses 1-2, although there were crowds, only the disciples went up to the mountain with the Lord.
[36]  To be righteous is to give one what he deserves.
[37]  Verses 17-20:This section is on the importance of the law.
[38]  1 Verses 17-18 say that the Lord did not come to abolish the law; 2 verse 19 refers to people in the Old Testament; and 3 verse 20 refers to people in the New Testament.
[39]  Verse 17 is the Seventh Day Adventists' basis for keeping the law; but to keep the law in this way is like committing suicide.
[40]  "To fulfill" v. 17 is to fill up that which is lacking in the law; it does not refer to what He would accomplish on the cross.
[41]  John 10:28 says, "They shall by no means perish forever."
[42]  This means that those believers who commit sins and do not repent will temporarily suffer what the unbelievers will suffer.
[43]  They will be released when the official criminals arrive.
[44]  James 5:12 says, "Above all things, my brothers, do not swear."
[45]  Verses 1-18: This section, the main subject of which is righteousness, is divided into three subsections: 1 alms-giving, 2 prayer, and 3 fasting.
[46]  Verse 1: "Take care not to do your righteousness before men in order to be gazed at by them."
[47]  Verse 8: "Your Father knows the things that you have need of before you ask Him."
[48]  Some say that since God already knows our need before we ask, we do not need to pray.
[49]  They also say that it is better not to pray than to have short prayers.
[50]  However, this verse does not mean that we should not pray.
[51]  Verse 13 tells us that since we stand for the kingdom of God and truly want to keep the teachings on the mount, we should ask God to deliver us from the hand of the evil one.
[52]  "For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever."
[53]  The word "for" indicates that this sentence follows the preceding passage and is very precious.
[54]  We pray this and that because the kingdom, the power, and the glory all belong to God and not to Satan.
[55]  "Kingdom" is the sphere in which God rules, "power" is the operation of God, and "glory" is the effulgence of God, which shines out from God Himself.
[56]  Verses 25-34: The main subject is on not being anxious concerning food, drink, or clothing.
[57]  The serving of mammon probably starts with the anxiety for food, drink, or clothing.
[58]  "Is not the life more than food, and the body than clothing?"
[59]  Verses 1-5: "You...be judged" is the opposite of "you judge."
[60]  Here it does not say that "you...be judged by others" but simply "you...be judged."
[61]  We know that this refers to being judged by God 1 Cor 4:4 .
[62]  The Lord said clearly that the Pharisees were hypocrites Matt 23:13 , but He also said that He did not come to judge the world John 12:47; 3:17 .
[63]  The dogs and hogs here, and especially those mentioned in 2 Peter 2:22, are the people mentioned in 2 Peter 2:21.
[64]  These people are like those who stay at the entrance of the church and have received some spiritual education.
[65]  Verse 14: "Because narrow is the gate and constricted is the way that leads to life, and few are those who find it."
[66]  The way is constricted because it is the way of God's will.
[67]  It is so narrow that it takes only God's will, and it is so constricted that it takes only God's will.
[68]  Nothing of the flesh, the world, or today's glory can be brought in. "Few are those who find it." This shows that truth is usually among a small number of people.
[69]  That the narrow gate and the constricted way need to be found shows that there are many people who do not even know that they exist.
[70]  Verse 21: "Not every one who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens."
[71]  Verse 1: "And when He came down from the mountain, great crowds followed Him."
[72]  Verse 2: "And behold, a leper, coming near, worshipped Him, saying, Lord, if You are willing, You can cleanse me."
[73]  Concerning verse 2, Spurgeon said that if someone is a leper yet he does not come to worship the Lord, his leprosy must be very serious.
[74]  In Mark 9:22-23, the man said, "If you can...."
[75]  It was a questioning of the Lord's power, and that is why the Lord rebuked him.
[76]  The leper did not doubt the Lord; he just did not know whether or not the Lord was willing.
[77]  Verse 17: On one hand, the word spoken through Isaiah, that "He Himself took away our infirmities and bore our diseases," was fulfilled at that time when the Lord healed the sick.
[78]  On the other hand, the actual fulfillment of Isaiah's word was at the time when the Lord was on the cross.
[79]  There are two groups of people with two extreme views: 1 The scope of the Lord's bearing of our diseases is as wide as the scope of His bearing of our sins.
[80]  The Lord today does bear our diseases, but it is different from the bearing of our sins in scope, in degree, and in significance.
[81]  In verses 2-17 several miracles are specifically put together.
[82]  Verses 18-27 are a record showing the effect of the Lord's presence.
[83]  However, the winds and the sea by themselves have no consciousness; the Lord was rebuking the demons behind the winds and the sea.
[84]  Verse 1:"And stepping into a boat, He crossed over and came to His own city."
[85]  Mark 2:1 says that people heard that the Lord was at home, so they brought the paralytic to Him.
[86]  Verse 12:"Now when He heard this, He said, Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are ill."
[87]  The Lord's word here implies that the tax collectors and sinners knew their own position and therefore drew near to the Lord, but that the Pharisees were self-righteous and therefore blamed the Lord for being gracious toward the tax collectors and sinners.
[88]  Verse 13:"But go and learn what this means, I desire mercy and not sacrifice,' for I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners."
[89]  Verse 20:"And behold, a woman who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years approached from behind and touched the fringe of His garment."
[90]  The daughter who had just died was twelve years old, and the woman here had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years.
[91]  This shows that the year the daughter was born is the first year that the woman began to suffer from the hemorrhage.
[92]  This signifies that when the Jews were receiving grace, the Gentiles had nothing to do with God.
[93]  Verse 1:"And He called His twelve disciples to Him and gave them authority over unclean spirits, so that they would cast them out and heal every disease and every sickness."
[94]  The Lord wants the disciples to preach the gospel of the kingdom of the heavens, so He does the things of the kingdom of the heavens.
[95]  Verse 23:"And when they persecute you in this city, flee into another.
[96]  For truly I say to you, You shall by no means finish the cities of Israel until the Son of Man comes."
[97]  Verse 30:"But even the hairs of your head are all numbered."
[98]  Concerning us, nothing is too small for Him to care for.
[99]  The number of our hairs recorded in heaven is the same as the actual number of hairs we have.
[100]  Verse 1:"And when Jesus had finished giving instructions to His twelve disciples, He departed from there to teach and to preach in their cities."
[101]  It seems that John should not have asked in this way because he clearly knew from the beginning what kind of person the Lord was.
[102]  The blind receiving sight signifies the opening of our spiritual eyes; the lame walking signifies that we are enabled to walk in God's way; the lepers being cleansed signifies that the charges of sins against us are removed; the deaf hearing signifies that we are enabled to know God's will; the dead being raised signifies that we have passed out of death into life; and the poor having the gospel announced to them signifies that we all who have nothing to do with God have the gospel preached to us.
[103]  Verse 13:"For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John."
[104]  Instead, he pointed out the Lord to people, "Behold, the Lamb of God!"
[105]  Chapter one tells us, on the one hand, that Jesus is Emmanuel, and on the other hand, that He will save His people from their sins.
[106]  In chapter two the word concerning Jesus being born as the King of the Jews was spoken from the mouths of the Gentiles.
[107]  In chapter three first it says to the Jews that they should produce fruit worthy of their repentance.
[108]  According to the chronological sequence, the incidents in chapter twelve concerning the disciples' picking ears of grain and concerning the Lord's healing the man with a withered hand took place prior to chapter eleven.
[109]  Why then in this book are they placed after chapter eleven?
[110]  This is to show us how the Lord was rejected, so that the book can continue on to chapter thirteen.
[111]  Verse 6:"But I say to you that something greater than the temple is here."
[112]  Since the Lord is the place that is filled with the glory of God, what He did for the glory of God was guiltless.
[113]  The Lord is greater than the priests and also greater than the temple.
[114]  The Lord said that He was David; this refers to His person.
[115]  The Lord said that He was the priest and the temple; this refers to His work.
[116]  Verse 16:"And He charged them not to make Him known."
[117]  Those who came because of His fame or because of their curiosity were not necessarily trustworthy.
[118]  Hence, the Lord did not want them to make Him known.
[119]  Binding the strong man is by the Spirit of God.
[120]  The casting out of demons needs to be done in the name of the Lord, and the Holy Spirit is the power of the name of Jesus.
[121]  The Lord did not mean to say that the disciples could violate the Sabbath.
[122]  Chapters 1 4:The preparation for the Lord to come as King and the temptation of the Lord.
[123]  Chapters 5 7:The moral nature of the kingdom of the heavens.
[124]  Before we go further to see the matter concerning the kingdom of the heavens, let us first review what we have covered earlier.
[125]  After the Lord was born, there was one who pioneered the way for Him.
[126]  That one was John, and he preached, saying, "The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near."
[127]  After him, the Lord also preached this, and He sent out the apostles also to preach the same thing.
[128]  The kingdom of the heavens has three aspects: 1 the outward appearance as the boundary, as presented in chapter thirteen; 2 our learning to go on by righteousness and grace under the authority of God this is the aspect of spiritual conduct and is spoken of in chapters five through seven; and 3 our reigning together with the Lord Jesus in the future, in the millennium this is the future reward spoken of in chapters five through seven.
[129]  Although in the first aspect the kingdom of God is equal to the kingdom of the heavens, the kingdom of God includes an additional period; that is, the sovereignty of God spoken of by the prophets in the Old Testament refers to the ruling of the kingdom of God, not the kingdom of the heavens.
[130]  In world history the church today has only the Roman Catholic Church, the state churches, and the private churches.
[131]  The Roman Catholic Church says that all believers in the world are under her regardless of the country in which they live.
[132]  The state church, such as the Anglican Church, claims that every citizen of that nation belongs to the church.
[133]  As far as the outward appearance, or boundary, is concerned, if someone claims to be a Christian, we cannot cast him out of the kingdom of the heavens, because the Lord has not permitted the collecting of the tares today.
[134]  In this parable the Lord did not say, "The kingdom of the heavens is or, has become like...," because the work of sowing the seed was done by the Lord Himself.
[135]  Verses 5-6:The second kind of seed is the seed that fell on the rocky places.
[136]  These are places where there are rocks underneath and shallow soil on top.
[137]  The deeper the seed is sown, the later it will grow; the shallower the seed is sown, the earlier it will grow because the shallow one is the first to receive the sunlight.
[138]  For example, in John 2, many believed into the Lord when they saw the signs which He did.
[139]  However, their believing was different from the believing mentioned in John 3, and the Lord did not entrust Himself to them John 2:23-24 .
[140]  Many zealous ones crowd around the Lord, but they do not touch the Lord.
[141]  The good seed are the sons of the kingdom v.
[142]  In the previous parable the seed is the word of the kingdom; in this parable the good seed are the sons of the kingdom.
[143]  When the seeds are sown into the ground, one by one they become wheat; when the word falls into our heart, we become sons of the kingdom.
[144]  Verses 27-28:When the slaves were wondering about the appearing of the tares, the master said that it was done by an enemy.
[145]  To collect in Greek means "to root out by violent force."
[146]  Rooting out is done not by a peaceful means but by a violent means; it is to cut off Prov 2:21-22; Deut 29:28 .
[147]  The first month is the time of Christ's working, and the second month is the time of the Spirit's working.
[148]  After this there is a gap, a period with no feasts.
[149]  Then in the seventh month there are feasts again.
[150]  Two passages of the Bible reveal the direct requirements for rapture.
[151]  First, Revelation 3:10 mentions the keeping of the word of the Lord's endurance.
[152]  When people revile the Lord today, the Lord endures and does not strike them to death with lightning.
[153]  We need to stand in the same position with the Lord Rev 1:9 , not loving glory, because the Lord has not received glory and was silent when rejected Isa 53:7 .
[154]  Matthew 13 speaks of three kingdoms: 1 the kingdom of the heavens referring to the realm v. 11 ; 2 the kingdom of the Son of Man v. 41 , referring to the millennial kingdom on the earth, which is for the Gentiles and the Jews; and 3 the kingdom of the Father v. 43 , referring to the heavenly millennial kingdom, which is for the believers and at which time the righteous will shine forth like the Lord as the Sun of righteousness.
[155]  This is a principle in the Bible that cannot be overturned.
[156]  Since the Lord did not explain the treasure, we can find the explanation from other portions of the Scriptures.
[157]  The treasures or, storehouses mentioned in 1 Chronicles 27:25 represent the glory of the kingdom of David.
[158]  The parable of the pearl should be interpreted as follows: The pearl signifies the beauty of the church.
[159]  The beauty of the pearl is the expression of life, not something of human work.
[160]  The stress of the treasure is more on the Israelites; another interpretation of the field is that it refers to the Jews.
[161]  "Gathering from every species" refers to all the Gentiles see Ezek.
[162]  "Brought onto the shore" means that they were gathered by the word of God, and everyone was forced to leave his own place.
[163]  Verse 1:"At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning Jesus."
[164]  This section is on the rejection of the Lord by the ruler, Herod.
[165]  And they took up what was left over of the broken pieces, twelve handbaskets full."
[166]  Only after the loaves had been broken did the crowds all eat and become satisfied.
[167]  When the Lord gives to people, He gives until they are fully satisfied.
[168]  This chapter gives us a hint concerning the heart of God.
[169]  The book of Matthew and the book of Mark both have the same goal, which is to cause people to know God's heart He so loved man that He gave His only begotten Son.
[170]  The Lord Jesus did not say directly that He is the Son of God, because He wanted to give people a hint concerning this.
[171]  The Lord has already done many things in the past, but now He will continue to do things in order to give us sufficient evidence to know Him as the Son of God.
[172]  Verses 15-20:"This parable" is the parable of a blind man leading a blind man, referring to the washing of hands.
[173]  The traditions of the Pharisees require people to wash their hands until they are clean and white, but such traditions ignore the fact that the people's heart remains defiled.
[174]  One does not need to go to Africa to find a savage; savages are everywhere in America, England, China, Japan, etc. This section shows 1 how defiled man's heart is, 2 how loving God's heart is, and 3 that it is the heart that needs cleansing; this is not an outward need.
[175]  Verses 29-31:The Lord returned to the midst of the children of Israel.
[176]  The Jews need to repent and the Gentiles need to believe.
[177]  Realizing that they are sick, the Jews will come to the Lord.
[178]  Verse 1:"And the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and testing Him asked Him to show them a sign out of heaven."
[179]  The Pharisees and scribes were not absolutely opposing one another, but the Pharisees and the Sadducees were opponents of one another, yet they came in one accord to test the Lord.
[180]  Verse 15:"He said to them, But you, who do you say that I am?"
[181]  Today the Lord is asking us also, "How would you answer?"
[182]  Are you a religionist, a social worker, a philosopher, or a revolutionist?
[183]  Even if you say that He is a prophet, He is still not satisfied.
[184]  People's observation of the Lord and their discussion about Him were inaccurate because they did not have the revelation of God.
[185]  These keys of the kingdom of the heavens were given not only to Peter but also to the other disciples.
[186]  Only when we have the keys do we have the authority to bind i.e., not to open and the authority to loose i.e., to open .
[187]  Verse 22:"And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, God be merciful to You, Lord! or, God forbid it, Lord!
[188]  Verse 26:"For what shall a man be profited if he gains the whole world, but forfeits his soul-life?
[189]  Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul-life?"
[190]  Why take the trouble to gain the whole world, that is, the wealth and glory of the world, yet lose the glory of the kingdom of the heavens?
[191]  The words "there are some" in Matthew 16:28 refer to Peter, James, and John.
[192]  "His kingdom" refers to the kingdom of the Son of Man.
[193]  Verse 6:"And when the disciples heard this, they fell on their face and were greatly frightened."
[194]  Verse 7:"And Jesus came to them and touched them and said, Arise, and do not be afraid."
[195]  Verse 18:"And Jesus rebuked it, and the demon came out from him; and the boy was healed from that hour."
[196]  This is to say that the demon ought not to do that.
[197]  Verse 1:"In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?"
[198]  "In that hour" can be translated "at the same time."
[199]  The fishing there indicates that the Lord covers His own glory and manifests His own grace.
[200]  The first section of chapter eighteen indicates how the believers in the present life should imitate the Lord in hiding their own glory, manifesting grace, and giving up their privileges.
[201]  On this occasion the disciples were arguing because: 1 nine people had been left at the foot of the mountain 17:1 ; 2 Peter was called Petros 16:18 , the rock for the building; 3 the keys of the kingdom of the heavens were placed in Peter's hands 16:19 ; and 4 the Lord had paid the temple tax for Peter 17:27 .
[202]  Verse 8:"If your hand or your foot stumbles you, cut it off and cast it from you; it is better for you to enter into life maimed or lame than to have two hands or two feet and be cast into the eternal fire."
[203]  If he will not stumble, others will not be stumbled by him.
[204]  Verse 18:"Truly I say to you, Whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven."
[205]  The meaning of this verse is similar to that of Matthew 16:19, which is a kind of indirect forgiveness.
[206]  God would bind or loose through the church or through Peter.
[207]  Verse 24:"And when he began to settle them, one who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him."
[208]  To "owe" speaks of the believers' indebtedness to God.
[209]  We do not know if the "ten thousand talents" is gold or silver, but we know that it is an enormous amount.
[210]  Verses 1-2:"And when Jesus finished these words, He departed from Galilee and came into the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan.
[211]  And great crowds followed Him, and He healed them there."
[212]  Verse 11:"And He said to them, Not all men can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given."
[213]  The amount that one can receive depends on the capacity one has.
[214]  To compel others to divorce is sin, and to compel others not to marry also is sin.
[215]  Verse 21:"Jesus said to him, If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens; and come, follow Me."
[216]  This young man's attitude was most vigorous; he thought that there was not one good thing he could not do.
[217]  Therefore, the Lord pointed out one good thing that he was unable to do to sell all and give to the poor.
[218]  Verses 1-16:"For the kingdom of the heavens is like a man, who is a householder, who went out early in the morning to hire workmen for his vineyard.
[219]  And having agreed with the workmen for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
[220]  And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the market place, and to those he said, You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.
[221]  The Lord needed to deal with two things in answering Peter's question: 1 to express agreement by saying that one who has forsaken all for the Lord will receive a reward, and 2 to deal with Peter's wrong attitude his self-righteousness, his commercial mentality, and his working for reward and not out of love for the Lord.
[222]  Verses 17-19:"And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, He took the twelve disciples aside privately, and on the way He said to them, Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes.
[223]  And they will condemn Him to death, and deliver Him to the Gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify Him, and on the third day He will be raised."
[224]  This shows that His death was not a martyr's death.
[225]  Martyrdom occurs as an incidental matter, but the Lord knew how and when He was to die.
[226]  Verse 1:"And when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage at the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples."
[227]  Verses 15-16:"But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonders that He did and the children who were crying out in the temple and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David, they were indignant.
[228]  And they said to Him, Do you hear what these are saying?
[229]  Verses 31-32:"Which of the two did the will of the father?
[230]  Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you that the tax collectors and the harlots are going into the kingdom of God before you.
[231]  For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the harlots believed him.
[232]  The parable in verses 1-14 is again a parable that cannot be applied fully in the human sense, because it is unreasonable for one to kill his slaves; the king cannot be so free as to socialize with the poor people; and he would never send an army to kill the ones he has called.
[233]  Verse 1:"And Jesus answered and spoke again in parables to them, saying."
[234]  This parable is very much related to the parable of the wicked vinedressers, which refers to God's rejecting of the Jews because they had rejected the Lord.
[235]  Verse 11:"But when the king came in to look at those reclining at table, he saw there a man who was not clothed with a wedding garment."
[236]  Verse 23:"On that day some Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection, came to Him and questioned Him."
[237]  The two parties departed and the Sadducees appeared on the scene; this is like a round-the-clock war.
[238]  The Sadducees believed that there is no resurrection and that a person is completely terminated after he dies.
[239]  Chapter twenty-three is the easiest chapter in the Gospel of Matthew.
[240]  Verse 9:"And do not call anyone on earth your father, for One is your Father, He who is in the heavens."
[241]  The word "father" here does not refer to the father in a family but to a father in the church, one who is in authority, such as the "fathers" in Catholicism.
[242]  The following "Father...who is in the heavens" proves that the "father" here denotes a religious father.
[243]  Unfortunately, by the second century the church fathers had come into being in the church; these were actually the disciples of the apostles.
[244]  For you cleanse the outside of the cup and the dish, but inwardly they are full of extortion and self-indulgence."
[245]  The above passage speaks of the Pharisees' avoiding the important issues and dwelling on the unimportant ones.
[246]  In order to understand Matthew 24 and 25, we must first understand the rapture.
[247]  After we have understood the rapture, we still need a considerable foundation before we can understand Matthew 24 and 25.
[248]  These two chapters are prophecies concerning 1 the Jews, 2 the church, and 3 the Gentiles.
[249]  In Matthew 21:43 the Lord prophesied about the taking of the kingdom of God from the Jews, and in 22:21 the Lord commanded the Jews to submit to the Gentiles.
[250]  Verse 1:"And Jesus came out from the temple and was going away, and His disciples came to Him to show Him the buildings of the temple."
[251]  When the disciples looked back to see the temple, they felt that it was most glorious.
[252]  On the mountain in Matthew 5:1 although it does not mention specifically the mountain's name , the Lord spoke concerning the law of the kingdom of the heavens, the prerequisite for entering into the kingdom of the heavens, for the future reigning with the Lord.
[253]  The second question of the disciples concerns the coming of the Lord.
[254]  Concerning His coming there are three Greek words that we need to differentiate: 1 parousia, 2 epiphaneia, and 3 apokalupsis.
[255]  The disciples asked the Lord about the sign of His coming.
[256]  In the original text there is another word worth noting concerning the Lord's coming again.
[257]  It is erchomai, which means "to come"; it is an active verb.
[258]  Parousia means "presence"; since it is a matter of presence, there must be two persons, and hence the rapture is implied.
[259]  What is emphasized in Luke is the holy city; what is emphasized in Matthew is the temple.
[260]  Luke 21:20 says, "But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that her desolation has drawn near."
[261]  The question in Luke concerns the signs before the destruction of the temple.
[262]  The second section, verses 7-14, refers to the things in the beginning.
[263]  Verses 15-31 refer to the things during the end time.
[264]  So between "the end" in verse 6 and verse 15, approximately nineteen hundred years have passed.
[265]  During these nineteen hundred years, God has not acknowledged the position of the Jews.
[266]  But in the future the situation will be restored to that which existed when the Lord was on the earth.
[267]  Verse 10:"And at that time many will be stumbled and will deliver up one another and will hate one another."
[268]  The stumbling, killing, and hatred are inevitable results of the persecution see John 16:1-2; Matt 10:36; Mark 13:12-13; Luke 21:16 .
[269]  Verse 11:"And many false prophets will arise and will lead many astray."
[270]  The record in the book of Daniel is very detailed in regard to the desolation caused by Antichrist see Dan 11:30-31 .
[271]  The holy covenant refers to the Ten Commandments, which is the covenant between God and the people of Israel.
[272]  Those who break the covenant are the rebellious Jews.
[273]  Verse 15:"Therefore when you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place let him who reads understand ."
[274]  The period of time from the setting up of the idol in the temple to the appearing of Christ is three and a half years.
[275]  Once the idol is set up in the temple, the destruction of the temple is not far away.
[276]  God allowed the temple to be defiled and destroyed because the Jews themselves defiled it first Jer 32:34; Ezek.
[277]  Verse 26:"Therefore if they say to you, Behold, He is in the wilderness, do not go forth; Behold, He is in the inner rooms, do not believe it."
[278]  False Christs and false prophets have already been mentioned several times in verses 5, 11, 23, 24, etc. Here they are mentioned again to emphasize the importance of this subject.
[279]  Concerning the wilderness, a place far from the world, it is easy for people to think that this is a likely place for Christ to be found.
[280]  "They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory."
[281]  In the first coming of the Lord, He manifested authority such as in casting out demons and healing the sick and glory.
[282]  The second coming of the Lord will manifest power and glory.
[283]  Verse 35:"Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words shall by no means pass away."
[284]  The word of the Lord endures longer than heaven and earth.
[285]  This means that before heaven and earth pass away, His words will be fulfilled.
[286]  The word "heaven" has two usages: 1 In the singular it means heaven in contrast to the earth.
[287]  2 In the plural it means the kingdom in which the Lord rules, which is the universe.
[288]  Verse 39:"And they did not know that judgment was coming until the flood came and took all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be."
[289]  Just as the situation was in the days of Noah, so it is today.
[290]  As the flood came suddenly, so the coming of the Lord will also be sudden.
[291]  Verses 40-41:"At that time two men will be in the field; one is taken and one is left.
[292]  Verse 42:"Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord comes."
[293]  If we connect verses 40 and 41 to verse 42, we can see that the distinction lies in being watchful or not being watchful.
[294]  If this were not the only distinction, the Lord would not use "therefore" and also would not warn us to be watchful.
[295]  If the condition for the rapture were based merely on regeneration and not on the watchfulness and work after regeneration, there would be no reason for the Lord to exhort us to be watchful.
[296]  Verse 44:"For this reason you also be ready, because at an hour when you do not expect it, the Son of Man is coming."
[297]  Some people, such as Scofield, consider this to be the Lord's addressing the Jews as the Son of Man, with no reference to the church.
[298]  However, the Son of Man is also the name of the Lord in the kingdom, and it is also used in His addressing Christians.
[299]  He too saw the Lord as the Son of Man Acts 7:56 .
[300]  In Hebrews 2:6 the "son of man" refers to the Lord receiving glory in the kingdom see also Heb 2:9 .
[301]  Verses 48-51:"But if that evil slave says in his heart, My master delays, and begins to beat his fellow slaves and eats and drinks with the drunken, the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour which he does not know, and will cut him asunder and appoint his portion with the hypocrites.
[302]  In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth."
[303]  Verses 48-51 are also divided into four sections: 1 Is the evil slave a Christian?
[304]  Whether he is a faithful slave or an evil slave depends on how he serves. b Identifying the Lord as "my master" shows that he has a personal relationship with the Lord, and "in his heart" also substantiates this fact just to confess with the mouth may not prove his relationship .
[305]  Editor's Note: The following study concerning the rapture is similar to the four articles entitled "The Rapture and the Tribulation" published in Notes on Scriptural Messages, Issue Nos.
[306]  43, 49-50, and The Christian Resumed , Issue No. 1, which appear in Volume 19 of the Collected Works.
[307]  The advocates of this school think that 1 Revelation 2 and 3 refer to today's church age, 2 Revelation 4:1 refers to the church, 3 the twenty-four elders in Revelation 4:4 signify the church's being raptured and glorified, and 4 Revelation 5 and 6 then go on to mention the beginning of the great tribulation.
[308]  But Revelation 4:1 does not address the whole church; it addresses only John when it says, "Come up here."
[309]  As to the twenty-four elders being the glorified church, this is truly nonsensical because: 1 Twenty-four is not the number of the church, but seven and multiples of seven are numbers referring to the church for example, the seven churches.
[310]  They thought that the four Gospels, the Acts, etc. were not written for the Gentile believers.
[311]  Scofield said that the Sermon on the Mount is exclusively for the Jews.
[312]  However, he forgot Matthew 28:20: "Teaching them the nations to observe all that I have commanded you," and John 14:26: "And remind you of all the things which I have said to you."
[313]  F. "This gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole inhabited earth...and then the end will come" Matt 24:14 . They say that there is a difference between the gospel of the kingdom and the gospel of grace.
[314]  Luke 21:36 also proves that not all, but only a portion, of the church will be raptured before the tribulation.
[315]  The records of Luke 21 and Matthew 24 are approximately the same, but Matthew emphasizes the Lord's coming and the tribulation, whereas Luke emphasizes the destruction of Jerusalem and the tribulation.
[316]  There are seven sections in verses 1-13: 1 ten virgins going to meet the bridegroom v. 1 ; 2 two kinds of virgins vv.
[317]  2-4 ; 3 their history or experience vv.
[318]  Prudence or foolishness does not refer to one's nature but to the difference in outward behavior.
[319]  We can prove this from one instance in the New Testament.
[320]  However, they have much in common: 1 they were all virgins; 2 they all carried a lamp, signifying their outward behavior; 3 their lamps were lighted, signifying a conduct that glorified God; 4 there was oil, representing the Holy Spirit, in their vessels; 5 they all went out to meet the bridegroom, that is, they were all waiting; 6 they all slept; 7 they all heard the midnight cry; 8 they all arose, signifying resurrection; and 9 they all trimmed their lamps, that is, they all prepared the oil.
[321]  They speak concerning the history of the foolish virgins.
[322]  The bridegroom's delay in coming was intended as a test to see who is prudent and who is foolish.
[323]  Those who consider the Lord to be tarrying are the evil slaves, and those who expect the Lord to return soon are the foolish ones.
[324]  1 At that time there is still the possibility and opportunity to buy oil.
[325]  Note that this does not mean that dead people still have the opportunity to be saved after their resurrection.
[326]  Verse 10:"And as they were going away to buy, the bridegroom came; and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast.
[327]  Eventually, the five foolish virgins needed the oil, and so they had to go and buy.
[328]  Unfortunately, when they went to buy, the Lord came.
[329]  Verse 13:"Watch therefore, for you do not know the day nor the hour."
[330]  The Lord told them to watch, showing that all the virgins had life.
[331]  The Lord did not say to the virgins that they needed to be born again to obtain salvation.
[332]  Verse 15:"To one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one, to each according to his own ability.
[333]  It is usually said that a talent is property, position, power, time, life, personal attributes, a good mind, good health, position in the church, etc. However, a talent is a gift, not a natural ability.
[334]  The Lord gave talents only to His slaves, and not to the slaves of others.
[335]  Let us compare the parable of the talents with the parable of the ten virgins.
[336]  The parable of the talents indicates the importance of using the gifts of the Holy Spirit, whereas the parable of the ten virgins shows the importance of being full of the Holy Spirit.
[337]  Oil is for ourselves, and talents are for the Lord.
[338]  Those who have talents should use them to serve God in building up the church; they should not use them for themselves.
[339]  Verse 21:"His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful slave.
[340]  You were faithful over a few things; I will set you over many things.
[341]  If we read only verse 20, it would seem that the reward depends solely on the gaining of other talents.
[342]  Verses 24-25:"Then he who had received the one talent also came and said, Master, I knew about you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not winnow.
[343]  And I was afraid and went off and hid your talent in the earth; behold, you have what is yours."
[344]  This does not mean that anyone dares to speak in this way.
[345]  Here, the Lord was trying to reveal man's hidden intentions.
[346]  Verses 31-46 give the parable of the sheep and the goats.
[347]  According to the Scriptures there are three categories of people: the Jews, the church, and the Gentiles.
[348]  Since in chapters twenty-four and twenty-five the Jews and the church have been covered, this portion describes the prophecy concerning the Gentiles at the end of time.
[349]  However, presently there are two interpretations regarding this parable: 1 that it refers to the future universal judgment at the end time, and 2 that it refers to the judgment of Christians.
[350]  Verse 31:"But when the Son of Man comes in His glory and all the angels with Him, at that time He will sit on the throne of His glory."
[351]  The names of the Lord in chapter twenty-five are all meaningful.
[352]  The Bridegroom is in relation to the virgins, the Lord is in relation to His slaves, and the Son of Man is in relation to the Gentiles; all of these describe a relationship with man.
[353]  Verses 35-36: "For I was hungry and you gave Me something to eat; I was thirsty and you gave Me a drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in, naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me."
[354]  The difference between the sheep and the goats lies here.
[355]  The reason that the sheep can receive the kingdom is because they gave food, gave hospitality, provided clothes, and visited the sick and those in prison, or performed similar good deeds.
[356]  At the judgment seat the believers will be judged by their faithfulness, and the Jews by whether they worship the beast or not.
[357]  The judgment for them is based on the way they treat the Lord, that is, the way they treat the little brothers of the Lord.
[358]  For I was hungry and you did not give Me anything to eat; I was thirsty and you did not give Me a drink; I was a stranger and you did not take Me in; naked and you did not clothe Me; sick and in prison, and you did not visit Me. Then they also will answer, saying, Lord, when have we seen You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister to You? Then He will answer them, saying, Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as you did not do it to one of the least of these, neither have you done it to Me." The evil ones are punished solely on the ground that they did not treat the Christians well.
