   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE FALL OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The man God created is very different from the other things that God created.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Man, like the angels, has a spirit, and like the lower animals, also has a soul.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When God created man, He gave man an absolute free will.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He did not make man a machine which can only turn according to His direction.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After observing the way God commanded man in Genesis 2 concerning what to eat and what not to eat, we can see that the man God created is not a dead machine under God's manipulation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Rather, he has a free will.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If he wants to obey God, he can obey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If he wants to disobey God, he can disobey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He has an absolute sovereign power over himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Both obedience and disobedience are at his discretion, and he can choose either at will.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the most important point.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have to realize that in our spiritual life God never robs us of our freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, without active participation on our part, He will not do anything for us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whether it be God or the devil, no one can work on us without the consent of our will, because man's will is free.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The spirit was originally the highest part of man, and the soul and the body were subject to it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Under normal conditions, the spirit is like the lady of a house, the soul is like the steward, while the body is like the servants.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the lady of the house needs something done, she charges the steward, and the steward in turn directs the servants to do it accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The lady gives the order in private, while the servants take the order from the steward.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Outwardly, the steward seems to be the master.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But actually, the real master is the lady of the house.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Unfortunately, man fell, failed, and sinned, so that the original, proper order of the spirit, soul, and body was overturned.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God has given man sovereign power over himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Man's soul is indeed endowed with many gifts from God, among which the most important ones are the mind and the will, or the consciousness and the volition.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God's original goal was for man to receive and digest God's spiritual life with the truth and reality in this spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God has given these gifts to man in order that man would live for Him according to His knowledge and His will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If man's spirit and soul were as perfect, healthy, living, and normal as when they were created, his body would have remained forever and would not have changed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If he had exercised the will in his soul to take the fruit of life, God's own life would have entered into his spirit; it would have saturated his soul and would have changed his body, so that he would not have needed to die or see corruption and would have received the "eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If that were the case, the soul-life would have been fully filled with the spirit-life, and man's whole being would have become spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Contrary to this, when the order of the spirit and the soul was destroyed, the inner man became darkened, and man's mortal body became no longer enduring.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Soon everything that belongs to the body will go into destruction and corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We know that between the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, man's soul did not choose the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Instead, he chose the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Genesis 2:17 God forbade Adam to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and told man that in the day he ate of it he would surely die.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Yet in the preceding verse God had promised that the fruits of all other trees could be eaten.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We see in this chapter that God purposely mentioned the tree of life first and then the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He also promised that the fruit of all trees except the tree of the knowledge of good and evil could be eaten freely.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Was it not God's purpose that Adam should eat of the fruit of the tree of life?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Who can say that this was not His purpose?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is the fruit that uplifts man's soul and dampens man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The knowledge of good and evil constitutes the work of the soul in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God forbade man to eat of this fruit, not only for the purpose of testing man, but because He knew that within man was the spiritual life and the soulish life, and that if man were to eat of this fruit, his soulish life would develop, and his spiritual life would die.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This means that he would lose the knowledge of God and would die to God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This was God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The knowledge of good and evil is wicked in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Knowledge comes from the intellectual part of man's soul.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When man ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, surely his soulish life developed and was uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once the soulish life develops and is uplifted, the spiritual life is suppressed, loses the knowledge of God, and becomes as dead.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Most servants of God would agree that the tree of life here is the life that God gives to man in His Son Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>That is, it is the eternal life, God's own uncreated life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Here are two trees, one to develop the spiritual life and the other to develop the soulish life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Although man was without sin, he was neither holy nor righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Man was in a neutral position: he could receive God's life and become a spiritual person, sharing God's nature, or he could develop his own created soulish life, making himself soulish, and thus put his spirit to death.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Man's tripartite nature is fully balanced by God, and if any one of his three parts experiences inordinate development, the other parts will unavoidably suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we understand the origin of the soul and the principle of its life, we will be greatly helped in our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The spirit comes from God and is given by God Num 16:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The soul, however, does not have such a direct relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The soul was produced when the spirit entered into the body.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The characteristic of the soul is that it is associated with the creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is a created life, a life in the natural realm.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If the soulish life remains forever in the place of a steward and allows the spirit to be the "lady of the house," its use will be very great, because by its resolve, man is able to receive God's life and to be related to God in life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, if this soulish life develops, it will suppress the spirit and subject all of man's conduct to the natural realm of the creature, thus disabling man from joining himself to God's supernatural and super-created life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When man ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, his soulish life developed, and he fell into the place of death.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Satan's temptation began with a question.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He knew that once a question was raised, Eve would have to exercise her mind to think.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If Eve had been willing to be subject to the control of the spirit, she would have rejected this question.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Once she decided to answer the question, she had to exercise her mind, and her soul had to act contrary to the spirit and beyond its limit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Moreover, Satan's question was full of mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He asked in this way in order that Eve would correct his mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In this way, her mind became more active.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But Eve did more than this; she changed God's word in her answer and in her conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The enemy tempted her by telling her that if she would eat, her eyes would be opened, and she would be like God, knowing good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>"And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise" Gen 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This was Eve's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>At the beginning Satan stirred up the mind in her soul.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Now he went one step further to gain her will, and she sinned.</S>
