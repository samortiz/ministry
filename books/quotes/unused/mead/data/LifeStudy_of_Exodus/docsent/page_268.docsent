   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE VISION OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN A TRANSPARENT AND CLEAR HEAVEN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The scene in chapter nineteen was dark and threatening.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But suddenly, in chapter twenty-four the thick cloud passes away, and the sky becomes clear and beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Exodus 24:9 and 10 say, Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of transparent sapphire, and as it were the body of heaven in its clearness lit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>. Beneath God s feet they saw something that had the appearance of a large transparent stone.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because human words cannot describe this scene, verse 10 says that they saw as it were a paved work of transparent sapphire, and as it were the body of heaven in its clearness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The words as it were indicate that human language cannot adequately describe this marvelous sight.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Moses could only liken what they saw under God s feet to a transparent sapphire stone, which was like the body of heaven in clearness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 11 goes on to say, They looked upon God, and did eat and drink lit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>. While they were looking upon God, they ate and drank.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As they experienced a most wonderful sight, they were refreshed by eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those on the mountain saw something no one had ever seen before.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God s redeemed, terminated, and replaced people were given a wonderful view of Him, even of His feet.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To see such a vision of God is to worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Exodus 24:1 says that those who went up the mountain with Moses were to worship afar off.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But in the following verses nothing further is said about the worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we read this chapter carefully and thoughtfully, we shall wonder when they worshipped Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The worship in this chapter consists of beholding God and of eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is true worship, the worship God desires.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God does not want us to worship Him by prostrating ourselves before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He wants us to enjoy Him and to worship Him out of this enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Have you ever been in a chapel or cathedral where the people worshipped God by eating, drinking, rejoicing, and enjoying the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This kind of worship is altogether contrary to our religious concept.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Yet this is the worship described in verse 11: They looked upon God, and did eat and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was the way they worshipped Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not try to analyze the Bible according to our natural mentality, and we should not try to systematize biblical doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>John 1:18 says that no one has seen God at any time, but Exodus 24 says that the seventy elders and the others who were with Moses saw God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They even saw God s feet.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Moses does not say that a paved work of transparent sapphire was under God s feet; he says that what was under His feet was as it were a work of transparent sapphire.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Colossians 1:15 Paul speaks of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How can the invisible God be seen?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Questions like these remind us that the Bible is divine, spiritual, and mysterious and cannot be systematized or analyzed by the natural mind.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to apply the record in Exodus 24 to our spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have been redeemed, we have experienced the termination of the cross, and, at least to some extent, we have experienced being replaced by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We can testify that we have been brought into fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At first, this fellowship is somewhat obscure.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But eventually, during the course of our fellowship with the Lord, the sky becomes clear and even beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then it seems that a certain spiritual element comes into view.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This element can be compared to transparent sapphire, which is as clear as the body of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we experience such fellowship it is difficult to say where we are.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is beyond words.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you have experienced the Lord in this way, it is a sign that your fellowship with Him has been enriched and uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have pointed out that in chapters nineteen and twenty the fellowship between the children of Israel and God was obscure, for a cloud of thick darkness was present.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But in chapter twenty-four, after the blood of the covenant was sprinkled on the people, the sky immediately became clear.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There was no thunder and no sense of threat, tension, or uneasiness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The entire atmosphere became tranquil and peaceful.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Have you not entered into such an atmosphere in your fellowship with the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Have you not experienced this kind of situation in your contact with Him?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I can testify that many times I have had a vision of the Lord like that described in Exodus 24.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The sky above me was clear, and in front of me there seemed to be something like a beautiful, transparent sapphire like the body of heaven in its clearness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There, in such a spiritual environment, I saw God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When some hear us testify of seeing God in this way, they may find fault and say, This is absurd and even heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Bible tells us that no one has ever seen God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God is invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How can you claim to have seen Him?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord Jesus said, Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God Matt 5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Certainly He was not in error in saying this, and He did not contradict the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In my fellowship with the Lord I like to have a clear sky and to see a work of transparent sapphire underneath Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I am happy when there is nothing between me and the Lord, when there is no cloud, shadow, or obscurity and everything is clear.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Those who have had a certain amount of experience with the Lord can bear witness to what I am speaking concerning the vision of God in a transparent and clear heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Only when we are in such a clear atmosphere can we receive the heavenly vision of the building of God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This was necessary for seeing the vision of the tabernacle in the Old Testament, and it is necessary also for seeing the vision of the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The vast majority of the people, however, were at the foot of the mountain and could not see this view.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They might have seen something, but they did not have as full a view as did those who were with Moses on the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Those who see God according to the scene described in Exodus 24 are nobles among the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They are particular people who have entered into a particular state.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They have seen God in a transparent and clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This experience itself is very noble.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Have you not had such a noble time with the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Many of us can testify of having had this kind of noble experience.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Those who have had this experience of seeing the Lord under a transparent and clear sky will not trade it for anything in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Nothing can compare with it.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If you have not had the kind of spiritual vision described here, it may indicate that you have not yet come to Mount Sinai in your experience with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You need to come to Mount Sinai and stay there with the altar, the sacrifices, and the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then in your fellowship with the Lord, the sky will eventually become clear and transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It will seem that in front of your eyes there is something which resembles the body of heaven in its clearness.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Then, in such an environment, you will see God and the heavenly vision concerning the desire of His heart to have a dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The reason there is virtually nothing said among Christians today concerning God s dwelling place is that many believers have never come to Mount Sinai to receive the vision of God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Many of those who are truly saved have not yet come up the mountain to behold the Lord in a transparent and clear heaven.</S>
