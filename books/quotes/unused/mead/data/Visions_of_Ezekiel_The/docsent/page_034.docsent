   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN THE POSITION AND CONDITION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF ISRAEL Scripture Reading: Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>20:6; 6:9; 11:12b; 13:4-5, 17-18; 14:3, 5; 22:25-30; 3:7; 2:3-4, 6; 22:13-19</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Old Testament, Israel was God's chosen and elect people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God had delivered them out of Egypt and brought them into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His putting the people of Israel into the good land typifies that God has put us into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our good land is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Ezekiel 20:6 says that the good land is the glory of all the lands.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ is the glory on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God has put us into the glorious Christ Who is flowing with milk and honey.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The people of Israel experienced three stages of the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the first stage, they enjoyed Christ in Egypt as the Passover lamb with the unleavened bread and bitter herbs.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the second stage, they enjoyed Him in the wilderness as heavenly manna and as the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Finally, in the third stage, they enjoyed Christ as the land, full of rich produce.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These three stages match our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we were saved, we enjoyed Christ as the Passover lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Afterward, we began to enjoy Christ as our daily manna.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, the ultimate enjoyment is to enjoy Christ as the good land with all His unsearchable riches in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eventually, Israel, God's chosen people, were living in the good land with the temple and the city.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The temple signifies God's house, and the city signifies God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's presence is in His house, and God's authority is in His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today in the church life, we have God's presence and God's authority because we are God's elect, living in Christ and enjoying all that He is.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE POSITION OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to consider the rights, the privileges, and the standing of the people of Israel.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Among all the peoples of the earth, Israel was chosen by God to be His unique people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Israel was also God's vine for the accomplishing of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God always grants His rich visitation with sunshine, air, rain, rich soil, and many other things which are necessary so that the vine can grow and produce something.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The vine in God's economy should produce grapes and wine which can satisfy God and can cause people to rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As God's elect and chosen people, Israel was also God's vine for His economy.</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Genesis 2:18 says that it is not good for man to be alone.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Likewise, it is not good for Christ, for God, to be alone.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ desires to have a Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to Ezekiel 16 and 23, Israel was God's Bride in the Old Testament.</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE CONDITION OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These were the rights, privileges, and the standing of the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But unfortunately, their actual condition was very poor.</S>
