   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOSPELIZING AND TRUTHIZING TAIWAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today Taiwan is prosperous, advanced, and educated.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All of these aspects are commendable and can be considered quite outstanding in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This provides us with a good situation and an excellent opportunity to gospelize and truthize Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to teach the saints the truth and to go and teach others the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We can teach our relatives, friends, classmates, and neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We all have relatives and friends who need us to teach them the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In addition, when we take any kind of public transportation, we can speak the truth to those around us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whether we are taking a short trip or a long trip on the road, even in the train, we can speak with those around us concerning the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The function of the church as a golden lampstand is to shine on people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should consider whether our church as a golden lampstand is shining.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we are not shining brightly, it may be that the gospel and the truth are not going forth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the meetings in Taipei, the singing is strong and the atmosphere is uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>With such an atmosphere, one thousand saints should be willing to go out to preach the gospel and speak the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The strength displayed in our singing needs to be brought into our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should be strong in the meetings as well as at home.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can sing a hymn to our relatives and speak the truth to them based on the hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we are unable to speak the truth, we will need to take the way of Christianity and invite our relatives to listen to a message on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, regardless of how wonderful the message is, it may not apply to them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, we should avoid this way and instead speak the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before visiting Taiwan this time, I received a letter from you, which said that many saints have a burden to go to different places in the world for the propagation of the Lord s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, we first need to truthize Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This can be compared to an apprentice who is learning to be a barber.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A person learning to be a barber should first cut simple hairstyles.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should learn and practice to speak the truth in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When I began to serve the Lord full time in 1933, I knew that I would take this way my whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Before this I was an accountant; I never attended a seminary.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, I knew that in order to serve the Lord full time, I had to be able to preach, so I practiced aggressively.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I learned as an apprentice and practiced by speaking to the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This kind of exercise truly helped, but the effectiveness was not evident, because the object of my preaching, the sea, could not respond.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, our situation is different.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There are people for us to practice with everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We can speak in the meetings and in our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can speak to our parents, our relatives, and our friends.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No matter where we are, we can practice and learn to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to speak all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we will receive this word and practice for two months, we will make progress.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In order to teach, we must first learn; without learning we cannot teach.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I am burdened for us to see that we must learn the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The word of the truth saves us and releases us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It also sanctifies us and builds us up.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After we learn the truth, we will be able to speak the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then the truth, the Lord s word, will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The more the truth grows, the more it multiplies.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we preach the gospel and teach the truth, our speaking will cause the Lord s word to spread on the island of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Eventually, everyone will know the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This will be a beautiful situation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The island of Taiwan is approximately three hundred and ninety kilometers from north to south, and the east and west coasts are divided by the Central Range mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It has a population of over nineteen million who reside in concentrated regions.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is a good environment.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should not consider that when we speak to someone, we are speaking only to that person.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If the person we are speaking to thinks that our words are reasonable, he will repeat what we say to other people.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In this way, our speaking will spread from one person to ten persons, and from ten persons to a hundred persons.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We surely need to rise up and speak.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>PREACHING THE GOSPEL IN ONE ACCORD</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we first came to Taiwan, we preached the gospel in one accord, and our whole heart was to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hence, there was some success.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At that time, we printed thousands of gospel tracts for the entire population of Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then the brothers and sisters distributed the gospel tracts to every house.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We divided the city of Taipei into several districts, and the saints went to every street and put gospel tracts in every mailbox.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In this way, every household in the city of Taipei received a gospel tract.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We also printed gospel banners, such as, God so loved the world, Jesus is Lord, and Jesus came to the world to save sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We posted these banners in train stations, bus stops, and at major intersections.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The brothers and sisters also hung banners on their doors.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When we saw a house with a big banner hanging on the door, we knew that one of the saints lived there.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In addition, we sent out gospel teams on gospel marches.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They went out during the day, and sometimes in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Every Lord s Day afternoon the gospel teams marched from the meeting hall on Renai Road to New Park.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They would beat big drums, shout the banners, and sing You need Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There was an amphitheater in the park that could seat three thousand people, and people would come out and fill the amphitheater almost every Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We collected at least five hundred names at every gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>On Monday evening we distributed the names to the saints, and they visited the people on their list.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Many elders and deacons in the churches in Taiwan were saved during those gospel gatherings.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Many people were saved in those days.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>One Saturday evening we baptized about four hundred people in three halls in Taipei and then baptized another three hundred the next morning.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We baptized over seven hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>By preaching the gospel in this way, our number reached fifty thousand in six to seven years; this was a hundredfold increase.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We need to be aggressive in preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We have been in Taiwan for thirty-five years.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In the first seven years our number increased from five hundred to fifty thousand, but since then our number has not increased.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If our rate of increase had continued at a hundredfold, we would now have five million saints.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If there are fifteen thousand saints in Taiwan who endeavor in the gospel, what would be our rate of increase?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If it were only thirty-fivefold, there would be 500,000 saints in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Therefore, our goal for the next seven years should be to increase to 500,000.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If we think that this is too many, we should at least aim for half of that number, which is 250,000.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If we are faithful, our number can reach 250,000 in seven years.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This depends on the endeavor of the young brothers and sisters and on the cooperation of the older brothers and sisters.</S>
