   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MOTHER THE HELPER IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that the mother, who, as the wife, should have been the helper in life, became a pillar of salt because of her worldliness 19:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When Lot's family came into the cave, there was no function of life, for there was no function of the proper wife.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As a result, they turned to incest, using such a sinful thing to replace the lost function of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is also the situation among many so-called Christian groups.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They have lost the function of the Body of Christ, the proper function of life, and use worldly methods to fill the gap.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Like Lot's group, they cannot produce the proper "Isaac" for the fulfilling of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because they use incest to secure seed, they produce "Moabites" and "Ammonites."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE DAUGHTERS THE MEMBERS</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have seen that the leader was drugged and befuddled and that the function of life was lost.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But the daughters, the members of this free group, still wanted to bear fruit and have the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although they had neither the proper leadership nor the function of life, they had an evil way of acquiring the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The same is true among many free groups today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order to bear fruit, we should live by Christ, live out Christ, pray, and help people to receive the living word of God so that they might be reborn.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the way to bring forth the proper fruit to be the "Isaac" for the fulfilling of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But look at today's situation: some groups use rock music, dancing, drama, movies, and games to satisfy their desire of securing the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the eyes of God, this is spiritual incest.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The free groups adopt these methods because the wife, being worldly, has lost her function.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the churches we need the function of life to produce seed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once people have lost the proper wife with the function in life, they use ugly and worldly means for securing the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the way of "incest" which brings forth "Moabites" and "Ammonites."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>HAVING LOST THE SENSE OF MORALITY Lot's daughters had lost their sense of morality, having been drugged with the wicked current of the evil world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If they had had any sense of morality, they never would have considered lying with their father.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first daughter laid with her father without any sense of shame and encouraged her sister to do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They talked peacefully with one another about this without any feeling of guilt.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When they were all in Sodom, Lot even proposed sacrificing his daughters to satisfy the Sodomites who were indulging in their sodomitical lust.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How could a man with a proper sense of spiritual morality have proposed such a thing?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He should have said, "Let them kill me and my guests, but I will never do this to my virgin daughters."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Where was Lot's sense of morality?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Lot had been drugged.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The result was that his daughters had no sense of morality and that their humanity was degraded to the lowest level.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some free groups today have also been drugged with the wicked current of the evil world and only care for success, not for the means.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They need the de-drugging of God's sobering word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>DESIRING TO HAVE THE SEED REGARDLESS OF THE MEANS Lot's drugged daughters were desirous of having seed regardless of the means 19:31-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They cared only for the goal, not for the way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many Christian groups are like this.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They say, "What is wrong with preaching the gospel in this way as long as we bring people to Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have won a great many people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How many souls have you won?"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They care for soul-winning, but they do not care for the proper way of doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>HAVING COMMITTED INCEST Lot's daughters committed incest, breaking the governing principle ordained by God 19:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Here we need to refer to Matthew 7:21-23.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord said that when He comes back, some so-called Christian workers will say, "Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name do many works of power?"</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Matt 7:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If they had not done these things, they would be unable to talk like this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord will not deny that they did such works.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But in Matthew 7:23 the Lord said that He will "declare to them, I never knew you; depart from Me, workers of lawlessness."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>For the Lord to say, "I never knew you" means "I never approved of you because you are a worker of lawlessness."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The runners in a race must stay in their lane.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However fast they run, they are not permitted to run lawlessly outside the boundaries of their lane.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Likewise, we need a governing principle for our spiritual activity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is not a matter of prophesying, casting out demons, or working miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is a matter of the Father's will Matt 7:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our spiritual activities must be the doing of the Father's will.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our preaching, loving one another, and all we do must be the Father's will.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we lack the assurance deep in our spirit that what we are doing is the Father's will, we should not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we do things without this assurance, we shall break the governing principle and commit spiritual incest.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is lawlessness in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord will never approve of such lawless workers.</S>
