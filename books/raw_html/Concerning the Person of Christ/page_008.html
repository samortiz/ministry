<p>After Peter had received the revelation from God, he declared, &#147;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God&#148; (Matt. 16:16).</p><p>At the time of the Lord’s transfiguration on the mountain, God spoke out of the cloud and said, &#147;This is My beloved Son, in whom I delight&#148; (Matt. 17:5).</p><p>The centurion and they that were with him at the Lord’s death said, &#147;Truly this was God’s Son!&#148; (Matt. 27:54).</p><p>When the Pharisees said that Christ is the Son of David (Matt. 22:42), the Lord said, &#147;How then does David in spirit call Him Lord?&#148; (Matt. 22:43), quoting the word (v. 44) from Psalm 110:1, proving that David in spirit had called Him Lord. Here He admits that He is the Lord of David. Although He became flesh and was made a son of David, He is actually the Lord of David because He is God.</p><p>Matthew 28:19 says, &#147;…baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.&#148; In this word to His disciples the Lord placed Himself one with the Father and the Holy Spirit, thus proving that He has the same divinity and Godhead as the Father and the Holy Spirit.</p><p>A passage in the Gospel of Mark says, &#147;He said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, thy sins be forgiven thee. But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their heart, Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?&#148; (Mark 2:5-7). This not only proves that the Lord Jesus is God who can forgive sins, but also indicates that the Lord confesses Himself to be God, the God who alone can forgive sins. Later in the same passage He also showed those who criticized Him that, just like God who searches men’s hearts, He knew the reasoning in their hearts and stood on the position of God to exercise God’s authority to forgive men’s sins (vv. 8-12).</p><p>Further in the Gospel of Mark it says, &#147;And when he was gone forth…one…asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?…And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God&#148; (Mark 10:17-18). The Lord Jesus’ word here proves that He admits He is God who alone is good. By saying this, the Lord wants the one who confesses that He is good to confess also that He is God, the only good One.</p><p>The Gospel of John states, &#147;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God&#148; (John 1:1-2). According to verse 14, the Word here is the incarnated Lord Jesus. He not only was with God in the beginning, but He is the very God.</p><p>The Gospel of John further states, &#147;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him&#148; (John 1:18). This tells us that the Lord, being the only begotten Son of God, is the expression of God. No man has ever seen God, yet He declares God. The Father is the invisible God, the hidden God; the Lord Jesus is the manifest God.</p>
