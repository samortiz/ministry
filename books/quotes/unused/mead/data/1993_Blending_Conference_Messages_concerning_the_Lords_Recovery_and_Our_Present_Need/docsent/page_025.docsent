   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MESSAGE THREE THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 1:3-14, 19-23; 3:8-11; 4:3-6 OUTLINE The Body of Christ is an organism of the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is constituted with the processed and consummated Triune God as its essence, element, and source, mingled with the regenerated and transformed tripartite believers as the counterpart of the constituting Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is the Body of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ as the fullness, the expression, of the all-inclusive and all-extensive Christ, who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Its constitution is through the dispensing of the Father's life and nature, of the Son's element brought forth by His redemption, and of the Spirit's essence through His sealing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Its constitution is also by the transfusion of Christ in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Its formation is through the baptism of the Spirit in the economical Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Its growth is by the increase of the Triune God within all its members, who grow into the Head, Christ, in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Its building up is by the bountiful supply out of the Head through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, which causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Its growth and building up both are in the realm of the genuine oneness of the Spirit, in which all the members of the Body should attain to the oneness of their common faith in Christ and of their common knowledge of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As the organism of the Triune God, it is also the fullness, the expression, of the consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this message we want to see what the Body of Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to see the Body of Christ from the angle which is revealed in the book of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A number of teachers of the Bible have said that the book of Ephesians is a book on the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But we need to see that Ephesians is not merely on the church but on the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Ephesians 1:22-23 says that Christ was made Head over all things to the church, which is His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Ephesians stresses the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today even the non-Christians are familiar with the term church, and they, along with many Christians, think that the church is a physical building with a bell tower.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They say that they are going to church or are in church, referring to a physical building.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They do not know that the church is not a physical building but the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to see what the Body of Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to Ephesians, the Body of Christ is something so mysterious that we cannot comprehend it with our natural understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If someone were to ask us what the Body of Christ is, we might only be able to tell them that the Body of Christ is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If they went on to ask us what the church is, we might only be able to tell them that the church is the gathering of the people called out by God from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Of course, this is true, but this is not the Body of Christ revealed in the book of Ephesians.</S>
