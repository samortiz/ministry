   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. Aspiring to Be a Praying Person</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to have the ambition to be a praying person, a person with power before God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some people are powerful before God, while others are not.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When some people speak, God listens.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When others speak, He does not listen.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What does it mean to be powerful before God?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It simply means that God listens to the person when he speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is as if God is happy to be influenced by such a one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some people can influence God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Being powerless before God means that God does not listen to the person when he speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Such a one may spend much time before God, but God ignores him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must have the desire and the aspiration to see that God often answers our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No blessing can be greater than God answering our prayers all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have to pray to Him, "May every request of ours be pleasing to Your ears."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is a most glorious thing for God to incline His ear to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is a tremendous thing for God to trust us to the extent that He can give us whatever we ask.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You have to present to the Lord the names that you are burdened with and pray for them one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>See how long it takes for God to save them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If your prayers are unanswered after a long period, you have to deal with yourself and with God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order for your prayers to be answered, it is often necessary to go through specific dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Unanswered prayer means that there is sickness somewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you do not mean business in this matter, you will always fail.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is why you need a record book.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The record book will show you whether or not your prayers are answered.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many people do not know whether their prayers are answered because they do not have a record of anything.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Newly saved brothers and sisters should learn to have such a record book.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then they will know whether or not their prayers are answered.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They will know whether there is a problem between them and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They will know also when they have to deal with themselves and when they have to deal with God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you have prayed for a long time and there is still no answer, you should realize that there must be some hindrance.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The hindrances always occur because there is sin in your conscience or there is a problem with your faith.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>New believers need not worry about the deeper aspects of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They need only to pay attention to their conscience and their faith.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before the Lord, we have to confess, deal with, and refuse our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the same time we have to genuinely and fully trust in God's promises.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we do this, we will see people being saved one by one, and our lives will be full of answers to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>F. Praying Daily</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You have to pray for those around you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Is there no one who needs your prayers?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How many colleagues do you have?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How many neighbors do you have?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How many relatives and friends do you have?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Always ask the Lord to place one or two special persons in your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the Lord places a person in your heart, He intends to save this person through you.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You should write down his name in your record book and continually bring him to the Lord through prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You need to set aside a fixed time daily for this work of intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whether it be an hour, half an hour, or a quarter of an hour, it must be a fixed time.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If there is no fixed time for prayer, there will not be definite prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As a result, there will not be any prayer at all.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hence, always fix a time for prayers, whether it is a quarter of an hour or half an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do not be too ambitious; do not plan for two hours and end up not being able to carry it out.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is more practical to set aside one hour, half an hour, or a quarter of an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Always fix a time to pray for those who need your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do not relax.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do this every day.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After a while, you will see sinners saved one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>G. A Few Examples of Intercession</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We will mention a few stories here to show you how others have done this work.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A Boiler Worker</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Once a boiler worker in a ship was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He asked the brother who led him to Christ, "Please tell me the first thing that I must do for the Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The brother replied, "The Lord will choose a few of your companions and put them in your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You will have to pray for them."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There were more than ten persons working together at his place.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He remembered one person in particular and prayed for him daily.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>That person found out about this, and he became angry.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Later, an evangelist came by and preached the gospel to the men there.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After the meeting he stood up and said, "I want to believe in Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The evangelist asked, "Why do you want to believe in Jesus?"</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He said, "A person has been praying for me for some time.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I have to believe in Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The boiler worker had been praying for this man.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Although he did not like this in the beginning, the power of prayer overcame him, and in the end he accepted the Lord.</S>
