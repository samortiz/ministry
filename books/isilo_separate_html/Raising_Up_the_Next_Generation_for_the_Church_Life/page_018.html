<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S ORDAINED WAY<br />
BEING TO GAIN HOUSEHOLDS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 2:39; Josh. 24:15; Gen. 7:1; Exo. 12:3; 2 Sam. 6:11; Luke 19:9; Acts 16:31; 1 Cor. 7:14; Eph. 1:4-5</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>In considering the exercise and practice of the God-ordained way to preach the gospel, we must include the unit of God&rsquo;s salvation; God&rsquo;s promise of salvation takes the household as a unit, not the individual as a unit&mdash;Acts 2:39; 16:31:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Concerning eternal life, the Bible takes an individual, not a household, as the unit; however, concerning salvation, it shows that men are saved household by household&mdash;1 John 5:12; Gen. 7:1.</li>
	<li>We hope that all the children who are born among us will not need our extra effort in the future to bring them to salvation and to rescue them out of the world; some have already been born into our fleshly family; we should make sure that they are born into our spiritual family also&mdash;Psa. 87:5; 2 Tim. 1:5.</li>
	<li>Whether or not the church will go on in the next generation depends on whether we can bring our own children to the Lord; if we lose as many as are born to us, our second generation will be gone&mdash;Psa. 127:3-5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>If generation after generation all those who are born into our midst stand fast and if we also have some increase from the outside, the church will be strong and its number will increase&mdash;2 Tim. 1:5.</li>
		<li>We must never give birth to a child only to lose it later; instead, those who are born to us must be regenerated&mdash;Psa. 127:3.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The basic principle in the Bible is that God saves men household by household:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the Old Testament:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The whole house entering the ark&mdash;Gen. 7:1; 1 Pet. 3:20.</li>
		<li>The whole house being circumcised&mdash;Gen. 17:12-13.</li>
		<li>A passover lamb for each household&mdash;Exo. 12:3-7.</li>
		<li>The priesthood being for the household&mdash;Num. 18:1, 11.</li>
		<li>The household salvation of Rahab the harlot&mdash;Josh. 2:19; 6:17.</li>
		<li>The household being blessed&mdash;2 Sam. 6:11.</li>
		<li>Rejoicing with the household&mdash;Deut. 12:7; 14:26.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In the New Testament:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The household of Zaccheus&mdash;Luke 19:9.</li>
		<li>The household of a nobleman&mdash;John 4:53.</li>
		<li>The household of Cornelius&mdash;Acts 10:2; 11:14.</li>
		<li>The household of Lydia&mdash;16:15.</li>
		<li>The household of the jailer&mdash;v. 31.</li>
		<li>The household of Crispus&mdash;18:8.</li>
		<li>The promise of the Spirit being to you and your children&mdash;2:39.</li>
		<li>Peace to a house&mdash;Luke 10:5-6.</li>
		<li>The household of Stephanas&mdash;1 Cor. 1:16.</li>
		<li>The household of Onesiphorus&mdash;2 Tim. 4:19; 1:16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In the Bible the head of a family has the special responsibility before God for bringing his whole household to the Lord and to His service; the head of the household can decide for his entire household&mdash;Josh. 24:15:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We should declare with faith that we have decided that our family will be a family that worships God and that our family will be a family that believes in the Lord; if we exercise our authority to take the lead, our children will go along&mdash;2 Cor. 4:13; Mark 2:4-5.</li>
	<li>The household is ours, and we have the power to decide whether this house will serve the Lord; when we take this stand, everyone who is under us will come to the Lord; they will have no other way to take&mdash;1 Cor. 11:3.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Household salvation is one of the greatest principles in the Bible; once you are saved, your whole household should be saved; as an individual you must first stand firm for the Lord, and then your household will change&mdash;7:14:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When we invite people to come to a meeting of the church, many will come by themselves; if we go to visit people in their homes, we will reach their whole household&mdash;Luke 19:5-9.</li>
	<li>One of the greatest failures of the Protestants is that they are too loose with their next generation; they allow their next generation to have the freedom to choose their own faith&mdash;Prov. 22:6.</li>
	<li>We may be selfish even in praying for the salvation of our children; not to pray for our children is wrong, but to be fully occupied with prayer for them in a selfish way is also wrong; the matter of the salvation of our children and their spiritual welfare is also a test to us&mdash;11:25.</li>
	<li>We should raise up our children according to the Lord&rsquo;s teaching; this is our duty and we should do it, but eventually their salvation and seeking of the Lord depend upon God&rsquo;s eternal choosing and predestination&mdash;Eph. 1:4-5.</li>
