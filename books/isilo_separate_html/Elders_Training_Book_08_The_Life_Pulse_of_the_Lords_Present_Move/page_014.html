<p>We must spend a long time to train the saints in every locality. You need to speak on these matters continuously as a kind of training for at least seven days; it is better to take two weeks. Then hopefully we may have a new start. Otherwise, whatever you do according to what you heard was going on in Taiwan and according to what you heard from my messages will just be a mere copying. That will be just like the tongue-speaking sister upholding the dead body to get it to walk. This will not work. Please keep in your good memory the contents of Book 7 regarding the principle of the genuine oneness. Based upon that fellowship, train the saints in your locality for two weeks with much prayer plus fasting. Train them with the fellowship in this book, Book 8. Take more time to demonstrate and to illustrate until all the saints in your locality get a full knowledge of the real way revealed in the New Testament concerning our meetings.</p>
<p>To teach the saints to meet according to the way revealed in the New Testament needs some time. Do not just change the way of your meetings. That does not work. You must stir up every member in your locality to rise up to be profitable persons for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, telling them that we are not here in any way or in any aspect to repeat the poor history of Christianity. We hate to see that repetition. We like to see a real restoration, a real revolutionizing in everything in the recovery. In studying the Bible we do not follow the old way. In prayer we do not follow the old way. In our service we do not like to follow the old way. In our meeting life, even the more, we do not like to follow the old way of Christianity. We refuse to repeat the pitiful, degraded history of Christianity.</p>
 <h2 class="head2">Meeting in Newness of Life</h2>
<p>I am not speaking anything to criticize anybody, but I cannot avoid telling you the truth that we must be renewed! I say again&mdash;we must be renewed! Romans 6 shows us that to be baptized means to be renewed, to have a new life and a new living (v. 4). We need to live, to behave, to act, to work, and to do everything in newness of life. Our meeting has to be in newness of life. We have probably applied Romans 6 to our daily life, but we probably have never applied it to our meeting. We need to meet in the newness of life, not in the oldness of the old history of Christianity.</p>
<p>You need to explain to the saints what it is to be in the oldness of the old history of Christianity. Sometimes we refer to the Lord&rsquo;s Day as Sunday. Sunday is an idolatrous term. We should not use the word Sunday since it is related to idolatry. We have to say &ldquo;the Lord&rsquo;s day&rdquo; (Rev. 1:10). The meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day may be at 10 a.m. We may look at our watch at 9:20 a.m. on the Lord&rsquo;s Day and still consider that it is quite early. One brother may say to another brother, &ldquo;How is your nephew, John? Where is he? Does he have a job? I&rsquo;m very concerned for him.&rdquo; Then these two brothers would proceed to talk about the nephew. After their talk about the nephew, they might begin to talk about the political situation abroad and in the United States. Eventually, one of the brothers realizes that it is five minutes to ten, and he tells the other brother, &ldquo;We have to go. The meeting will start in five minutes. Let&rsquo;s go to the meeting.&rdquo; Then when they come to the meeting, they look around to see what might be the best place for them to sit down. Then they go to that place to sit and listen. This is an example of the oldness to repeat the pitiful history of Christianity.</p>
<p>A brother may sit there, showing his &ldquo;godliness,&rdquo; his &ldquo;piety.&rdquo; He may pray a little bit, waiting for someone to open the meeting. He may be expecting one of the elders to open the meeting. We need to tell the saints that this is the natural act to keep the oldness of the pitiful situation of Christianity. This is to bring the degraded Christianity into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. It is a shame! We have to cast out this dead oldness. We should not tolerate the pitiful situation that has invaded the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. In the past ten years the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been somewhat invaded and polluted. This is to destroy, to mar, to ruin, to corrupt the temple of God (1 Cor. 3:17).</p>
<p>Early in the morning on the Lord&rsquo;s Day you should rise up and say, &ldquo;Lord, thank You for a new day, even a day of the Lord. Lord, fill the day with Yourself! Fill me for this day; even fill me with Yourself for the church meeting! Saturate me and soak me! I like to be fully one with You to go to the meeting with You! I believe You are with me and You are in me, and I am going to the meeting a half hour early!&rdquo; If every member of the local church would be like this, what kind of wonderful meeting in the heavens we would have! This is what we mean when we say that we need to have a fresh meeting, full of newness of life. This will put the enemy to shame, and this gives much glory to the resurrected and ascended Christ. This will be very convincing to newcomers and very attractive to the backsliders. I hope that in your locality you will begin to practice what I have been speaking to you.</p>
<p>It is not worthwhile for us to pay attention to tongue-speaking. Let us talk about Christ. Our prophecy must be full of Christ. When many Christians talk about 1 Corinthians 14 they forget what Paul spoke of in the foregoing chapters, especially chapters one through three. They isolate chapter fourteen to fit into their concept. At the beginning of 1 Corinthians Paul stressed that Christ is God&rsquo;s center, that Christ should be our portion, our enjoyment (1:9). We all have been called into the enjoyment of this dear Son of God, and this One has been given as wisdom to us from God to be our righteousness, our sanctification, and our redemption (1:30). We have to enjoy this One who is the very mystery of God. We have to understand the wisdom concerning this mystery (2:6-7). Then when Paul came to chapter eleven and to chapter fourteen, he charged the saints to practice the meeting life with the very Christ he revealed in the foregoing chapters. I hope that all the elders will be deeply impressed with these things, not to copy anything in your locality but to practice the best thing on the proper standing of the genuine oneness of the Body of Christ.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> </body></html>
