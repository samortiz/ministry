   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOUR PICTURES The Portrait of the Man-Savior</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 22:47 23:25 we need to be impressed with four pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first picture is the portrait of the Man-Savior, the portrait of the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Due to the surrounding persons, the portrait of the Man-Savior is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this portrait we see the God-man, the One who is perfect, dignified, and full of divine splendor and of human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As we consider the picture presented by Luke of the Man-Savior from the time He was arrested until He was sentenced to death by Pilate, we see the portrait of the Lord Jesus as the perfect and complete God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Often we have pointed out that as the God-man the Lord Jesus is the complete God and a perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, perhaps we have not appreciated before the portrait of the God-man that is presented in this portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I hope that in reading this section of the Gospel of Luke all the saints, especially the young people, will have a clear view of this portrait of the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord Jesus in 22:47 23:25 is portrayed as the true God and a real man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This God-man was arrested, mocked, blasphemed, despised, and judged.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But as He passed through all this, He was fully portrayed as having the highest standard of morality, as possessing the human virtues with the all-surpassing divine splendor.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here we see not only the Man-Savior s divine attributes; we also see His divine splendor.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this One we see the true God and a proper man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He was fully qualified to be the Substitute for the sinners for whom He intended to die.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to Luke s record here, He was ready to die for sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Portrait of the Disciples</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The second picture we see in this portion of Luke is that of the Man-Savior s followers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From what we see in this picture, we cannot give any credit to the eleven disciples, especially to Peter, John, and James, in their natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If credit can be given, it should be to the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The eleven were altogether natural; they acted as if they did not have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Peter, for example, said that he would never deny the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was he who took up a sword and cut off the ear of the high priest s slave.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It was he who denied the Lord three times.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How natural he was!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, as we view the picture presented here of the Lord s disciples, we need to realize that this is a picture of us as well.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here we have a portrait of what we all are in the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Picture of the Religious People</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The third picture we see is the picture of the religious people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They were false, deceitful, and full of pretense.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They worshipped God, taught people about God, and apparently tried to keep the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But they came to arrest the Lord not in the daytime but at night, and not in a public place but in a private place.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Knowing that they would arrest Him in this way, the Lord deliberately went to the Garden of Gethsemane, a private place, so that they might arrest Him in their deceitful way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Actually, they did not arrest Him; He gave Himself over to them to be arrested by them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>With these religious people we see nothing but falsehood and deceit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Picture of the Roman Rulers</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Finally, we have a picture of the Roman government and its rulers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>With these Roman rulers there was no justice.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this picture we see the darkness and corruption of Roman politics.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>DEATH, RESURRECTION, AND JUBILEE</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As we consider these pictures, we can understand the situation in the midst of which the God-man went to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to realize that He was not brought to the cross He went to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the cross He laid down His soul life purposely to accomplish an all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This death ushered Him into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Through His death and resurrection the jubilee is accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Furthermore, the Man-Savior brought His followers with Him into death.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In this way He terminated them so that they could be replaced and germinated.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then in His resurrection they could enjoy Him as their jubilee.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Moreover, in His resurrection the Lord s followers become His Body as His continuation, His reproduction.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In resurrection they are one with Him to enjoy the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We cannot receive such an understanding of the Lord s death simply by reading the Gospel of Luke itself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Luke, we should remember, received his impression regarding the Lord s death and resurrection from Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, in order to have a fuller understanding of the Man-Savior s death and resurrection, we need Paul s Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we read the Gospel of Luke in the light of the Epistles of Paul, especially the book of Hebrews, we shall see that a fuller enjoyment of the jubilee, the Sabbath rest, will be in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As we have pointed out in previous messages, the enjoyment of the jubilee in the coming age depends on our enjoyment of the jubilee in this age.</S>
