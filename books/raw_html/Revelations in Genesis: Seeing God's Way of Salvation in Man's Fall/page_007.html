        <h2 class="head2">Being Constituted a Sinner and<br />
Having a Record of Sin</h2>
<p>The fourth result of man&rsquo;s first fall is that man was constituted a sinner. When man&rsquo;s soul was corrupted, man&rsquo;s body was transmuted, and man&rsquo;s spirit was deadened; his whole person was damaged. This is the condition of a sinner. All the persons in the world are sinners because they have Satan&rsquo;s life within and have been corrupted by Satan. The life of Satan is the sin that dwells in man, the evil that is present with man (Rom. 5:19; 7:17, 20-21). Therefore, man is constituted a sinner.</p>
<p>When man fell and was fully corrupted, God could not ignore this matter. He had to deal with sins because He is not only a Lawmaker but also an Executor of the law. Since man sinned and violated God&rsquo;s commandment, man had a record of sin before Him. Thus, there were two major problems after man fell: first, man had a sinful life, a sinful nature within him, and second, man had a record of sin before God.</p>
<p>In both the East and the West, past and present, many sages have debated whether man&rsquo;s nature is good or evil. Some believe that man&rsquo;s nature is evil, and others believe that man&rsquo;s nature is good. There is a debate because there are indeed two elements in fallen man, a good element and an evil element. Man&rsquo;s good element comes from God&rsquo;s creation; man&rsquo;s evil element comes from Satan&rsquo;s life. Before a person is saved, he has the elements of good and evil in him even though he does not have God&rsquo;s life. Sometimes we really have good thoughts and intend to honor our parents. This is related to the element of good in us. But at other times, our heart is filled with murderous thoughts, envious hatred, and disobedience to parents. This is related to the element of evil in us. This is the reason that sages throughout time have debated about the nature of man.</p>
<p>Under God&rsquo;s shining we know that such a debate is unnecessary, because man has both the good created life as well as the corrupt fallen life. The element within our created life is good, and the element within our fallen life is corrupt. The good element is from God&rsquo;s created life; the corrupt element is from Satan&rsquo;s corrupt life. Although man can still manifest the good element, he manifests the corrupt element much more. Therefore, as a vessel, man has been corrupted.</p>
<p>Not only is fallen man corrupt in himself, he has a record of sin before God. Man&rsquo;s sinning always has these two aspects. For example, a mother may tell her children not to play with their drinking glasses, but when she leaves them alone, they ignore her words, play with their glasses, and break them. When the mother returns, she can tell from their actions that they have violated her word. Thus, the children have a record of sin, a transgression, before her. This transgression, however, does not have anything to do with the physical being of the children. The mother may also tell her children not to drink a substance in a bottle lest they be poisoned, but when she leaves them alone, they may taste the substance out of curiosity. This transgression has a different consequence because now they have taken a poisonous substance into their body. Their drinking not only violates the mother&rsquo;s commandment, which results in a transgression outside their body, but also it has poisoned their body. If it were merely a transgression outside their body, the mother would need only to forgive them. However, since a poisonous substance has entered into their body, the problem cannot be solved by outward forgiveness alone. The mother must seek emergency medical treatment.</p>
<p>The fall of our forefathers in the garden of Eden can be likened to both examples. After man fell, he had both a record of sin before God, having a transgression outwardly, and Satan&rsquo;s poisonous nature in his body inwardly.</p>
<p>As Adam&rsquo;s descendants, we all have Satan&rsquo;s poisonous nature within us, whether we are Chinese or foreign, educated or illiterate, good-natured or ill-natured. Whether we believe this word or not, the facts speak for themselves. We need to consider all the instances in our lives when we acted against our inward desire and will. Often we have an inward desire to not do evil, to not fall, or to not do devious things, but at a certain point, there is a driving power within us that pushes us to do immoral things against our will. We often do many dishonorable things against our will, and even though this makes us unhappy, we have no ability to refrain from doing them. There is a power in us that takes us captive. This power is Satan&rsquo;s poisonous nature. This proves that we have been corrupted inwardly, having a poisonous sinful life with its corrupting element.</p>
<p>Just as an empty vessel is designed to contain something, Adam was made to contain God. However, Satan came into man first. After this, man became complicated and corrupt. Man first acted in violation of God&rsquo;s commandment; therefore, he has a record of sin. However, man also has the activities of the devil within him. When we are careful, the devil may be constricted a little, but the devil can come out with just a little inward stirring. I once aspired to improve myself, and I had great ambitions in my childhood. As I grew, however, the more I wanted to improve, the more of a mess I became, and many devious tricks were manifested in me. I know that many people have even more tricks than I, but all these are the result of the devil coming into man and corrupting him inwardly.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
