But the prophecy in vv. 15-31, concerning the remnant of the Jews, definitely will be fulfilled in the last three and a half years of this age, the time of the great tribulation, the second half of the last week prophesied in Dan. 9:27, which will begin with the setting up of Antichrist&#8217;s image (the idol) in the temple (v. 15) and will end with Christ&#8217;s open coming (v. 30).</p><p>15<sup>2</sup> Abomination denotes an idol (Deut. 29:17). Here it refers to Antichrist&#8217;s image, which will be set up as an idol in the temple of God (Rev. 13:14-15; 2 Thes. 2:4) at the beginning of the great tribulation (v. 21). Hence, this idol will be another sign of the consummation of this age.</p><p>15<sup>3</sup> Lit., causing desolation, desolating. The abomination, the image of Antichrist, will cause desolation. Antichrist is called &#8220;the destroyer&#8221; (Apollyon-Rev. 9:11); he will do much destroying (Dan. 8:13, 23-25; 9:27).</p><p>15<sup>4</sup> Holy place here refers to the sanctuaries in God&#8217;s temple (Psa. 68:35; Ezek. 7:24; 21:2).</p><p>20<sup>1</sup> Winter is a time when escape is difficult.</p><p>20<sup>2</sup> On the Sabbath one was allowed to walk only a short distance (Acts 1:12), a distance not adequate for escaping. The mentioning of the Sabbath here indicates that the Jews would still keep the Sabbath after the restoration of the nation of Israel. The disciples, the audience for the Lord&#8217;s word here, had a twofold status, one as representatives of the remnant of the Jews and the other as the New Testament believers, who constitute the church. In the section of the Lord&#8217;s word that concerns the Jews (vv. 4-31), the disciples represent the remnant of the Jews, whereas in the section that concerns the church (24:32-25:30), they represent the New Testament believers. In the four Gospels, in matters regarding outward circumstances, the Lord treated His disciples as Jews, but in matters concerning spirit and life, He considered them New Testament believers.</p><p>21<sup>1</sup> The great tribulation will occur in the last three and a half years of this age. See note 24 in Rev. 11. The great tribulation spoken of here will have Jerusalem as its center and Judea as its circumference, whereas the trial mentioned in Rev. 3:10 will have Rome as its center and the whole inhabited earth as its circumference.</p><p>22<sup>1</sup> The chosen here refers to the Jews, God&#8217;s chosen people (Rom. 11:28). So in the succeeding verses.</p><p>23<sup>1</sup> The Jews rejected Jesus as their Messiah and are expecting a Messiah who is yet to come. They need to be warned that Messiah, the Christ, will not arise here or there on earth but will descend from heaven on the cloud.</p><p>24<sup>1</sup> Antichrist will be the last of the false Christs and will work signs and lying wonders with the power of Satan in order to deceive the perishing (2 Thes. 2:3, 9-10).</p><p>24<sup>2</sup> Another beast in Rev. 13:11 denotes the last of the false prophets (Rev. 19:20), who will do great signs to deceive those who dwell on earth (Rev. 13:13-14).</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 721-727; Hymns: #887</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> </body></html>
