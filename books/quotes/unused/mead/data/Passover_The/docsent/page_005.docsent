   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Examined for Four Days</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Just as the Passover lamb was examined for four days 12:3, 6 , so Christ was examined for the same period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After He was arrested, the Lord was subjected to six examinations, three at the hands of the priests who examined Him according to the law of God, and three under the Roman rulers, who tested Him according to Roman law.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Eventually, Pilate had to declare that he could not find fault in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In fact, Pilate declared three times that he found no fault whatever in Him John 18:38; 19:4, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ as the Passover lamb was faultless, without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Killed by the Whole Assembly</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Speaking of the Passover lamb, 12:6 says, "The whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do you know who killed the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was killed by the congregation of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that we all had a part in killing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Years ago, I read an article describing how the children of Israel slew the lamb during the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to this article, the lamb was put on a cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The children of Israel took two wooden bars and formed a cross.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They tied two legs of the lamb at the foot of the cross and fastened the other outstretched legs to the crossbar.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then they slew the lamb so that all its blood was shed, for they needed all of the blood to sprinkle on their door frames.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all know that the Roman Empire used the death penalty of the cross to crucify criminals, but the children of Israel used this method long before the time of the Roman Empire to slay the lamb at their Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The way the lamb was killed affords a picture of Christ's crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, the type of the Passover foreshadowed both the date and the way Christ would be put to death for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Blood for Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Exodus 12:7 says, "And they shall take of the blood, and put it on the two side posts and on the upper doorpost of the houses, wherein they shall eat it" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The blood put on the lintel and on the doorposts was for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This blood typifies the redeeming blood of Christ Matt 26:28; John 19:34; 1 Pet 1:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As the children of Israel applied the Passover lamb, they were in houses that had been sprinkled with the blood of the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This indicates that redemption is based on union.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The blood of Christ cannot redeem us unless we are in union with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only by being in Christ can we be redeemed with the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we are outside of Christ, His blood cannot redeem us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But once we are in Christ as the house, we are redeemed by the blood that has been sprinkled upon the lintel and doorposts of the house.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because redemption is based on union, we must be in union with Christ, identified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then, because we are one with Him, we can be redeemed by His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The ark built by Noah also illustrates this matter of union.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Noah and his family entered into the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this way they were in union with the ark, identified with the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Through this union, this identification, they were saved and redeemed by the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the same principle, in order to be redeemed by the blood of the Passover lamb, the children of Israel had to be in the house that had been sprinkled with the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, any who would apply the redemption of Christ must be in union with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Its Flesh to Be Eaten</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The flesh of the Passover lamb was to be eaten for life supply 12:8-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The same is true of the Lord Jesus as the fulfillment of the type.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Each of the Gospels speaks of the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Gospel of John, however, goes on to say that the flesh of Christ is edible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In John 6:53 the Lord Jesus says that we must eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and in verse 55 He declares, "My flesh is true food."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Flesh here signifies the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The life of Christ is edible; it is our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is mentioned in the Gospel of John because this Gospel, in contrast to the others, is focused on life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, this Gospel reveals that the blood of Christ redeems and that the life of Christ supplies.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hallelujah, we have the blood of the Lamb for redemption and the flesh of the Lamb for the supply of life!</S>
