   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>To Be Heavenly Being</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Submit to the Authority of God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The main significance of the church being heavenly is that it is under God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The nature of the church is to submit to God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Water is not viscous, but oil is.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, viscosity is the nature of oil.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the same way, heaven also has a nature.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Its nature is to submit to God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Heaven, as spoken of in the Bible, strongly implies submission to God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To further illustrate the different natures of things, let us consider the difference between the pliable nature of a handkerchief and the rigid nature of a piece of chalk.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If a person attempts to fold a piece of chalk, it will snap.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is because its nature cannot withstand folding.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, if a person folds a handkerchief, it will not snap like the chalk.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is because its nature can withstand folding.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, the difference in nature between a piece of chalk and a handkerchief is that one can be folded easily and the other cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order to submit to God s authority, His creatures must have the nature of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They must be heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the universe only the heavens submit to God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The particular nature of heaven is that it submits to God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Wherever heaven is, God s authority is there.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, to be heavenly is to have the nature of submitting to God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Apart from the Spirit of God, we cannot touch the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God s life is in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we want to touch God s life, we must touch the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, the Spirit of God is God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the same principle, God s authority is in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, heaven represents God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The prodigal son in Luke 15:18 said, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This implies that when a sinner commits sins, he sins against heaven; that is, he sins before God the Father who is in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When a sinner sins, he offends God and violates God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since God s authority is in heaven, whenever a sinner touches God s authority, he touches heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God s ruling is heaven s ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The primary significance of the church s being heavenly is that the church is under God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The nature of the church involves submission to God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to its nature, a handkerchief is pliable because it is soft.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If a handkerchief is not pliable, something is wrong with it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Likewise, according to its nature, the church submits to God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, it is not difficult for the church to submit to God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If the church does not submit to God s authority, something must be wrong with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church s submission to God s authority is due to her heavenly nature.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Most people understand heaven as a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many Christians think that once they go to heaven, they will enjoy peace and blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They even sing about it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This thought is entirely from the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Their basis is Revelation 7.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, Revelation 21:2 says that the New Jerusalem will come down out of heaven from God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>People think that they will to go to heaven, but the Bible tells us that the New Jerusalem will come down out of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Not only will men not go to heaven, but heaven will come down to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Man pays much attention to going to heaven, but God pays attention to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some men dream all day long about going to heaven, but God is concerned only with coming down to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The source of the concept of the blessing and happiness of heaven is entirely something of the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Roman Catholic Church uses the superstition of the blessing of heaven to distract people.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many teachings in Chinese Buddhism and Taoism are similar to this.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, we who believe in the Lord must see that in the Bible heaven is a matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There is a difference between being heavenly and being earthy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They are altogether two different natures.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>One is glorious, and the other is lowly.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>One is of God, and the other is not of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although everything that is with God and is heavenly is blessed, joyous, peaceful, and bright, the emphasis in the Bible is that heaven is the place entrusted with God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To nullify heaven is to nullify God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, the Bible says that the heavens do rule Dan 4:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The ultimate dwelling place of God is the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The New Jerusalem will come down out of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Hence, heaven is a place not for enjoying blessing but for ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Since heaven is related to God s authority, Satan also attempts to usurp it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Ephesians 6:12 speaks of the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This shows that Satan is the ruler of the authority of the air 2:2 who rebels against God and attempts to encroach upon God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God s enemy encroaches in the sphere of God s authority in the air; thus, spiritual warfare is a matter of being heavenly and having authority.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is not a matter of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>For the church to be heavenly means that it is under God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Only when the church is under God s authority can it deal with the enemy who encroaches upon God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is altogether not a matter of blessing but a matter of warfare, and it is not a matter of peace or joy but a matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Some may say, Does not Ephesians 1:3 speak of the blessings in the heavenlies?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we read the context carefully, we will realize that these blessings are not peace or joy but the Father s choosing, the Son s redemption, and the Spirit s sealing.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Certainly, all these items are heavenly, but we should not forget that heaven takes God s authority as its center.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The primary significance of heaven is God s authority.</S>
