<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 5:17; 4:16; Gal. 6:15</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>As believers in Christ, we have been made a new creation&mdash;2 Cor. 5:17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The most crucial matter in God&rsquo;s full, all-inclusive salvation is His making us a new creation in Christ&mdash;Gal. 6:15.</li>
	<li>The term <em>new creation</em> is an expression conveying the plain and real fact that we have been saved to be made a new creation&mdash;2 Cor. 6:2; 5:17.</li>
	<li>Like the old creation, the new creation is corporate; in the new creation we all are parts of the new man, the church, composed of the many sons of God&mdash;Eph. 2:15; 1:5; Heb. 2:10-12.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is not just to redeem, to repossess, the fallen old creation but to regenerate man to make him the new creation&mdash;John 3:3; 1:12-13; 2 Cor. 5:17.</li>
	<li>We are a new creation through our organic union with Christ&mdash;v. 17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To be in Christ is to be one with Him in life and nature; this is of God through our faith in Christ&mdash; 1 Cor. 1:30; Gal. 3:26-28.</li>
		<li>Apart from this organic union, we remain in the old creation, but by the organic union with the Triune God in Christ, we are in the new creation.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The new creation is a person regenerated with the life of God and living in the inner man, not in the outer man&mdash; John 3:3, 5-6, 15; 2 Cor. 4:16.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>There is a basic difference between the old creation and the new creation&mdash;Gen. 1:1; 2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15; Rev. 21:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The old creation does not have the divine life and nature, but the new creation has God within it as its life, nature, appearance, and expression.</li>
	<li>The old creation as an empty vessel has no content of God, but the new creation as a corporate vessel has God as its content&mdash;Eph. 1:22-23; 3:19b.</li>
	<li>The old creation was old because God was not part of it; the new creation is new because God is in it&mdash;4:22-24.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s goal is to produce the new creation out of the old creation; the new creation is the old creation transformed by the divine life&mdash;2 Cor. 3:18.</li>
	<li>The new creation&mdash;the mingling of God with man&mdash; takes place when the Triune God in Christ as the Spirit is wrought into our being; this is the mingling of divinity with humanity&mdash;1 Cor. 6:17; Eph. 3:16-17a.</li>
	<li>The New Jerusalem is new because, as God&rsquo;s new creation, it has God&rsquo;s nature of newness&mdash;Rev. 21:2, 5a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Since newness is God, to become new is to become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead by having God wrought into us&mdash;Rom. 6:4; 7:6; Eph. 4:23-24.</li>
		<li>The New Jerusalem will be the ultimate consummation of the realm of newness, which is Christ&mdash; 2 Cor. 5:17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ dealt with the problem of the old creation through His crucifixion, His all-inclusive death on the cross&mdash;Luke 23:44-46; Heb. 10:20; Exo. 26:31:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The main item terminated by the death of Christ was the old creation.</li>
	<li>Because Christ died on the cross as the Firstborn of all creation (Col. 1:15), His death terminated the old creation.</li>
	<li>In the sight of God, the entire old creation was crucified with Christ and buried with Him&mdash;cf. John 20:5.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The new creation comes into being by resurrection&mdash; 2 Cor. 5:17; 1 Cor. 15:20, 23, 45:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In His work in His resurrection, Christ rose up on the first day of the week to germinate the new creation&mdash; John 20:1:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The fact that Christ rose on the first day indicates that the universe had a new beginning in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection.</li>
		<li>Whereas the Lord&rsquo;s death was the termination of the old creation, His resurrection was the germination of the new creation.</li>
		<li>When the old creation is germinated with the divine life, it becomes the new creation.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The germinating element of the new creation is the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In His resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit to germinate some of those in the old creation to be the new creation&mdash;John 20:17.</li>
		<li>First Corinthians 15:45 implies the old creation with the soul as the center and the new creation with the Spirit as the center.</li>
		<li>The life-giving Spirit is the center and lifeline of the new creation&mdash;v. 45b; 2 Cor. 5:17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We are made a new creation by being regenerated&mdash; 1 Pet. 1:3; John 3:6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Regeneration causes us to become a new creation, something which has the element of God within it&mdash;1:12-13; Ezek. 36:26.</li>
	<li>Regeneration causes us to have God&rsquo;s life and element, thereby making us a new creation&mdash;2 Pet. 1:4.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In our experience we are in the process of becoming a new creation by being broken and renewed&mdash;2 Cor. 5:17; 4:10-12, 16; Eph. 4:23-24:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Although our spirit has been regenerated, our soul with its faculties of mind, will, and emotion remains in the old creation and needs to be renewed.</li>
	<li>To be renewed is to have God&rsquo;s ever-new essence dispensed into us to replace and discharge our old element&mdash; 2 Cor. 4:16; Rom. 12:2; Titus 3:5.</li>
	<li>Through the process of renewing, we are transferred from the realm of the old creation into the realm of the new creation to become the New Jerusalem&mdash;Col. 3:10; Rev. 21:2.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We need to overcome the old creation by living in the ascension of Christ in resurrection&mdash;S. S. 2:8-13; 4:6-9; 6:10a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The physical things are part of the old creation; if we desire the physical things of the world, we are living in the old creation.</li>
	<li>A Christian who lives in the old creation cares for physical things.</li>
	<li>The old man cares for physical things, but we should be the new man living in ascension as God&rsquo;s new creation in resurrection&mdash;Eph. 4:22, 24; 2:4-6.</li>
	</ol></li>
