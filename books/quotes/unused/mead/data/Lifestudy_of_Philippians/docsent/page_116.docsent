   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONSTITUTED OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As Christians, we differ in the measure of Christ we have within us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some have given more ground to Christ; others have given Him less room to grow in them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No doubt Paul s measure of Christ was full.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that Christ had been fully formed in him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Philippians 1:21 Paul could even declare, To me to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ had been wrought into Paul and had actually become his constituent.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, Paul was a man completely constituted of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This was the reason he could say that to him to live was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Dietitians often tell us that we are what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The food we eat eventually becomes our constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is wrought into our fibers and even our cells.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If a person eats a great deal of a certain food, he will eventually become constituted of that food.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By the time Paul wrote the book of Philippians, he had been a believer in Christ for nearly thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Throughout those years, Christ had been more and more wrought into Paul s inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul was continually eating Christ, partaking of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Eventually, having been constituted of Christ, he became a Christ-man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As one who was constituted of Christ, he could testify, To me to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We today should be the continuation of Paul s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are here to live Christ, to have Christ wrought into us until our mind, emotion, and will are constituted of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A METABOLIC CHANGE</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Romans 12:2 Paul charges us not to be conformed to this age, but to be transformed by the renewing of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To be conformed to this age is to be fashioned outwardly according to the style of the age, according to the trend of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To be transformed is to be inwardly and organically renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some have defamed us, accusing us of bending people s minds.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We utterly repudiate this false accusation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By the Lord s grace we seek to minister something divine and spiritual which can transform a person s mind.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Mind bending is the result of an outward influence on a person s mind, but mind renewing involves inward, organic, metabolic transformation in life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The longer we stay in the Lord s recovery, the more our mind is transformed metabolically.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Automatically our thinking is renewed and changed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This happens because a new element is added into our being to discharge the old element and to replace it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Day by day and meeting by meeting, something divine, spiritual, holy, and heavenly is being transfused into us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This element is Christ with His unsearchable riches.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As the riches of Christ are infused into us, they become the new element within us which discharges the oldness and causes an intrinsic, inward, metabolic change.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The more we are transformed, the more Christ is given room to settle down in us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In fact, the process of transformation is the process of being occupied and possessed by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For our mind to be transformed means that Christ has taken possession of it and saturated it with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Likewise, when our emotion and will are saturated with Christ, He becomes the very constituent of these inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this way Christ becomes subjective to us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE EXPERIENTIAL CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For centuries, the subjective Christ has been ignored by the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many devoted Christians have directed their love to the objective Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They believe in Him, respect Him, exalt Him, and take Him as the object of their worship.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, in many cases, they regard Him as One who is far away in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although they may love Him, they may not experience Him abiding in them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They may work diligently for Christ, but not realize that Christ is not only in heaven, but also dwelling within them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some have even received the wrong teaching that Christ does not dwell in the believers, but is merely represented in them by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They think of the Holy Spirit as an agent sent by Christ to represent Him, to work in them, to move in them, and to inspire them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, according to the Word of God, the indwelling Spirit is not an agent of Christ; He is actually Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>According to Christian experience, the Christ who dwells in us is identical to the Spirit who indwells us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The indwelling Spirit is the practical Christ, the subjective and experiential Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we have a proper realization of this, we shall not try to separate the Spirit from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Three of the Godhead are one.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Father is in the Son, and the Son is realized as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When the Spirit reaches us and comes to live in us, all Three of the Godhead come to dwell in us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>How wonderful that Christ is in us!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our Christ is subjective and experiential.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we would live Christ, we must realize that He is subjective as well as objective.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As the mighty God, the Lord of all, the One who has ascended to the heavens, and who has been enthroned and crowned with glory, Christ is objective.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Of this we should not have any doubt.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But Christ is also subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He dwells in us, He lives in us, He is seeking to settle Himself in us, and He is also working to saturate our entire being with Himself.</S>
