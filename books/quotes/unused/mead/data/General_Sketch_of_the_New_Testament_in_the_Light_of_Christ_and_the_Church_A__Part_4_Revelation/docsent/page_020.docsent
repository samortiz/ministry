   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Man-child Born</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 5a says, And she brought forth a son, a man-child, who is to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Man, in man-child, is a meaningful and strong word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Scriptures, woman signifies weakness, while man signifies strength.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must keep in mind that chapters twelve, thirteen, and fourteen are written in a symbolic way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They are a record with signs.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, the woman here is not an actual woman; she is a symbol, a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the same way, the man-child here is also a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this picture, there is a woman, signifying something weak, out of whom comes a man-child, signifying something strong.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates that the man-child is the stronger part of this woman.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Within the woman, the weaker part, representing all the redeemed people of God, there is a stronger part, who are the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This man-child will shepherd all the nations with an iron rod.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Revelation 2:26-27 tells us who this one is.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It says, And he who overcomes and he who keeps My works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations; and he will shepherd them with an iron rod.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The ones who shepherd the nations with an iron rod are the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the first three chapters of Revelation there are the seven churches, which are weak as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They are a weak woman, but the Lord calls out the overcomers from among them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The overcomers are a small number who stand up to fulfill God s purpose when the majority of the people of God have failed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This principle of the overcomers runs throughout all the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the time when Moses brought the people of Israel out of Egypt, God s purpose was that the entire nation of Israel would be a kingdom of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, they failed God in His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Only one tribe, the Levites, stood up to fulfill God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this way they became the overcomers at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The people of Israel were a weak woman, and the tribe of Levi was the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the book of Judges, all the judges such as Gideon were overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The majority of God s people failed to carry out His purpose, so a small part stood up to be the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the recovery of God s people in the Old Testament time, God s intention was to have all His people come back from Babylon to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, very few of them came back as a remnant with Ezra and Nehemiah.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who came back to Jerusalem became the overcomers standing in the position of God s people to fulfill God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today it is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The church as a whole has failed God today in His purpose, so the Lord is calling the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A small remnant will answer the Lord s call to rise up and represent the church to fulfill God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These become the overcomers; in principle, they are the man-child.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Man-child Caught Up to God</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>and to His Throne and the Woman Fleeing</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Revelation 12:5b-6 says, And her child was caught up to God and to His throne.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place there prepared by God so that they might nourish her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To be caught up to God refers to the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, the place of rapture is not the place mentioned in 1 Thessalonians 4:17.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This verse tells us that the majority of the church will be caught up to the air, not to the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The times of the raptures in Revelation 12 and 1 Thessalonians 4 are different, and the places to which they are raptured are also different.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The woman will be nourished for a thousand two hundred sixty days, that is, for three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This indicates that the overcomers will be caught up, raptured before the three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is why we cannot accept the teachings of the pre-tribulation rapture or the post-tribulation rapture by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Here is a woman, signifying the totality of God s redeemed people, who brings forth a man-child, a part of the woman, who is caught up to the throne of God before the last three and a half years of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After the rapture of the stronger part, the main part of the woman will still remain on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The proper understanding of the rapture is that there will be more than one.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Revelation 14 mentions another rapture, the rapture of another group of overcomers called the firstfruits vv.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As we shall see later, these two groups of overcomers are not the same, but both groups will be raptured to the throne before the tribulation of three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In this way, a part of God s people will be raptured before the three and a half years, while the majority of the people of God will be left on the earth to pass through the great tribulation.</S>
