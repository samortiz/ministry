<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Restoring and Establishing<br>Jehovah's Beloved Israel</H2><P>Another issue of Jehovah's judgment upon the nations is the restoring and establishing of His beloved Israel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Jehovah Having Compassion on Jacob</H2><P>Jehovah will have compassion on Jacob, choose Israel again, settle them in their land, and give them rest from their pain and turmoil and from their hard service as slaves (Isa. 14:1-3, 32b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Moab Offering Sacrifices to Zion</H2><P>Moab, having changed, will offer sacrifices to Zion, seeking Israel's counsel and protection (16:1-4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Israel Looking to His Maker</H2><P>Israel will look to his Maker, his eyes will behold his Holy One, and he will not forget the God of his salvation and the Rock of his stronghold, which is for protection (17:7, 10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Cush Bringing a Gift to Jehovah</H2><P>Cush, at the time of its flourishing, will bring a gift to Jehovah, unto Mount Zion, the place of the name of Jehovah (18:1, 7).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Egypt Building an Altar as a Sign<br>and a Testimony to Jehovah in Their Land</H2><P>According to 19:19-25, Egypt will build an altar as a sign and a testimony to Jehovah in their land and a pillar near its border. Jehovah will make Himself known to the Egyptians, and they will worship Him with sacrifice and offering and will vow a vow to Him and accomplish it. Jehovah will heal them, and they will turn to Him and entreat of Him. Then the Egyptians will worship Jehovah with the Assyrians, and Israel will be a third party with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the land. Jehovah will bless Egypt, Assyria, and Israel, saying, "Blessed be Egypt My people and Assyria the work of My hands and Israel My inheritance" (v. 25).</P>
