In these verses Paul mentions some negative things that can defile the temple of God. In verse 14 there are the unbelievers, lawlessness, and darkness. In verse 15 there is Belial, that is, Satan, the Devil. Finally, in verse 16 there are the idols. These are the five negative, unclean things which can defile the temple of God. As the temple of God, we have to be separated from these things. To say this is easy, but to put this matter of separation into practice is not so easy. As a part of the temple of God, you need to consider whether or not you are fully, thoroughly separated from all these negative things. Have you separated yourself from the unbelievers, from lawlessness, from darkness, from the enemy Satan, and from anything involving idols?<p>A captive needs to be captured; a letter needs to be written; a mirror needs to be unveiled; a vessel needs to be broken; and an ambassador needs to be absolutely on this earth for the Lord&#8217;s interest and under His authority. The ambassador of the United States in Germany is there for the interest of the United States and is fully under the authority of the government of the United States. With a co-worker, there is the need to be bound together with God. As the temple of God, we need to be holy or separated. In 7:1 Paul said, &#8220;Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.&#8221; The defilement of flesh and spirit in this verse refers to the five negative things mentioned in 6:14-16. Some of those items will defile your flesh while others will defile your spirit. The idols and Belial will defile your spirit, so you have to separate yourself, purify yourself, from all the negative things.<p>A dwelling place is always an expression of the dweller. When one looks at the inside of an American house, he can recognize that an American lives there. If you look at the residence of a Japanese, you will immediately know that a Japanese person lives there. This is because a dwelling place is always an expression of the dweller. Since we are the dwelling place of God, we should be the expression of God as the Dweller. You may say that you are a part of the temple of God and yet still be yoked together in something with an unbeliever. There may be some things with you which are very unrighteous and in darkness. Maybe you are involved with something connected with Belial or the idols. In order to be the temple of God in reality, we have to be separated absolutely and thoroughly that we may perfect holiness in the fear of God. If we consider that we are the dwelling place, the temple of God, and yet still hold on to something which is not corresponding to the nature or character of God, we are not perfecting holiness in the fear of God.<p>Holiness is separation unto God from all things other than Him. As the temple of God, we need to separate ourselves from anything which is against the divine nature, which is against the holy character of God. Perfecting holiness is to make this separation full and perfect, to have our entire being-spirit, soul, and body-fully and perfectly separated, sanctified unto God (1 Thes. 5:23). This is to be fully reconciled to God. Since we realize that we are the temple of God, we have to separate ourselves, to perfect holiness in the fear of God. We are afraid that if we do not do this, we will offend God and His shekinah glory will leave us.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>An Autobiography of a Person in the Spirit &nbsp; pg 19</div><br></body></html>
