   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>What does it mean for us to be in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I will explain this with an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Peking produces a certain kind of lacquer box with a number of boxes being in a set.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Each box in the set fits into another one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Outwardly there is only one box.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But when one opens up the box, there are more boxes inside that one box; within the big box are the smaller boxes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the way we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our being in Christ is in contrast to Christ being in us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are all descendants of Adam, and we were all in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Adam is like the big box, while we were like the small boxes.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The many small boxes come out of that one big box.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Out of the one Adam, we were produced.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When one is opened, there are many.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are the many.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we put the many into the one, we see only the one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From our side, there are many individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are the many individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From God's side, we are only one man in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is like the many small boxes contained in the one big box.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Outwardly there is only one box.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because we are all in Adam, "the disobedience of one man" constituted many sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because we are all one in Adam, every one of us is condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God saved us according to the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He has put us all into Christ, and "through the obedience of the One the many will be constituted righteous."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because we are one in Christ, we have all received justification of life Rom 5:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God considers all of us as one person in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the same way, He considers all of us as one person in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Adam is like one big box, while Christ is like a second big box.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God has taken us out of the first big box and put us into the second big box.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are one in the first big box Adam, and we are one in the second big box Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Bible calls the Lord Jesus "the second man" and "the last Adam" 1 Cor 15:47, 45 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord Jesus is the last Adam, and God has included all of us in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When Jesus of Nazareth was living as a man on earth, He was the unique One.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But when He went to the cross, God included us all in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, when Jesus of Nazareth was crucified, that cross was not only His cross, but our cross as well.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because God put us into Christ, the cross is no longer just His cross, but a cross in which all those who are in Him have a part.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must realize that the cross of Christ is also our cross.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If God had not put us into Christ, we would have nothing to do with the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since God put us into Christ, we have a great deal to do with the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thank and praise God that when Christ was crucified, we were included in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since we are included in Him, His experience on the cross becomes our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is what Romans 6:6 means when it says, "Our old man has been crucified with Him."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we are not in Christ, we cannot be crucified together with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Consequently, someone has said, "If we are not in Christ, we cannot be with Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is a spiritual word as well as a scriptural word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must remember that in order for us to be with Him, we have to be in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we are not in Him first, we cannot be with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is our fundamental faith, and we must be clear about it.</S>
