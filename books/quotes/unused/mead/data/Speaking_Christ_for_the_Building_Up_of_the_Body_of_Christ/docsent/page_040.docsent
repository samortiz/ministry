   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CARING FOR THE NEW ONES IN THE SCRIPTURAL WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO BEAR REMAINING FRUIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should not think that it is hard to help the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord told us that His yoke was pleasant and His burden was light Matt 11:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to practice taking care of the new ones in the home meetings and small group meetings until we become experts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to practice and exercise in a regular way by caring for the new ones in the home meetings week after week.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This has to be our habit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should pick up one or two new ones and consider them as our babes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we care for them week after week, practicing the points of fellowship in this chapter, we will learn a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By practicing this fellowship, we can keep the new ones living and seeking in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I believe that many of us, as we endeavor in the new way, will even be raised up to train the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to practice constantly, week after week and year after year, to care for the new ones and to raise them up.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we go to visit people about two weekends every three months to get about two new believers, we will have six to eight under our care within a year.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Their spiritual education will come from our care.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our meetings with them will become our meeting life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we are faithful to consistently care for the new ones that we have gained, our fruit will remain.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If fifty out of one hundred saints meeting together can practice visiting people according to this fellowship, and two of the six to eight new ones that they have baptized remain, the church can be doubled within one year.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The traditional way of meeting with one speaker cannot meet all the needs of the new ones or of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The specific needs of someone who has been saved for thirty years and another one who has been saved for only three days cannot be met in a large meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our old way of meeting was a deadening way because we met in a way that could not meet the needs of all attendants.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The patients in a hospital are not served with the same food or the same medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The appropriate food and medicine is dispensed to them according to their condition and need.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is why we need to come back to the way of meeting revealed in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Question: How many visiting saints should go to the home meetings?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is always good to have two or three visiting saints go to the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is not as good to go by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For more than three to go would also be good if it is possible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who go must bear the burden to play ball in the home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You must tell the new ones how they should participate in the meeting by either praying, calling a hymn, or singing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Train and instruct them to join in with your speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By your training in meeting after meeting for a couple of months, they will eventually join you in speaking spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After half a year at the most, they should be completely prepared to participate in the regular meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Question: How can I care for a Spanish-speaking believer, not being able to read the Spanish Life Lessons with her?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is a difficult problem.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There were hundreds of English-speaking saints in our training in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some of the Chinese-speaking saints were able to understand English and translate for the English speakers during the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This was good.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But when we began to take care of the home meetings, the English speakers were not able to do much for the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It was too difficult to translate for them, so we decided not to keep the English speakers in Taipei to help with the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They could have helped only if they learned Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The problem of different languages, which comes from Babel, is difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some brothers and sisters should do their best to learn Spanish.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If there is a will, there is a way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You are not too old for this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do your best to help the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A WORD OF WARNING</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The things that I have fellowshipped with you in this message and in other messages are just some principles.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the practical steps, you still need to pray and look to the Lord for His instant guidance and to follow His leading and guidance in whatever you do and say in any kind of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Please do not make any proposed principles a legality.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must hold a spirit of learning all the time regardless of how much we have learned and experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must be poor all the time in our spirit for receiving further revelation of the Lord.</S>
