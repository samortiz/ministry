        <h2 class="head1">THE LORD JESUS BEING THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus must come to be man&rsquo;s light in order for his spiritual eyes to be opened. After saying that the man was blind from birth in order that the works of God might be manifested, the Lord Jesus said that He was sent by God to do the works of God; the Lord Jesus was sent to open people&rsquo;s eyes in order for them to see (John 9:3-4). Then the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;While I am in the world, I am the light of the world&rdquo; (v. 5). This means that His opening of people&rsquo;s eyes so that they might see depended on His coming to be their light. Man&rsquo;s ability to see depends on the Lord Jesus being the light of the world. In order to recover the sight of man&rsquo;s inner eyes, the Lord Jesus must enter into man to be his light. When He, the light, enters into man, He enlightens man, and man&rsquo;s inner eyes are opened.</p>
<p>Spiritual blindness, the inability to see spiritual matters, is the issue not only of losing one&rsquo;s inward sight; it is also the issue of being inwardly dark. Darkness is the same as blindness. Blindness prevents people from seeing, and darkness also prevents people from seeing. Therefore, in order to restore man&rsquo;s sight, the Lord Jesus must come as light to enlighten man and dispel the darkness in man&rsquo;s heart. It is for this reason that the devil, the ruler of the world, always tries to prevent people from believing in the gospel of the Lord Jesus; the devil blinds the eyes of their heart so that the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ might not shine on them (2 Cor. 4:4). The devil is clearer than man concerning the gospel. He knows that if a person believes in the gospel, the Lord Jesus as the light will enter into him to illuminate him. Therefore, the devil uses many schemes to frustrate man from believing in the gospel of the Lord Jesus and thus keeps man in darkness. The devil works in man to counter the work that the Lord Jesus desires to do in man&rsquo;s heart. The Lord Jesus wants to be the light of man to illuminate man inwardly so that the eyes of man&rsquo;s heart might be opened to see. As the light of the world, only the Lord Jesus can dispel the darkness in man and heal the blindness within man so that man may have sight. Only the Lord Jesus can solve the problems of darkness and blindness in humanity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOW THE LORD JESUS GIVES MAN SIGHT</h2>
<p>After saying that He would work the works of God, which is to open man&rsquo;s eyes, and that He was the light of the world, the Lord Jesus spat on the ground, made clay of the spittle, and anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay (John 9:6). He did this to open the eyes of the blind man and to give him sight. Then He told the blind man to go and wash in the pool of Siloam (v. 7). Although this seems insignificant, it is very significant. If we consider the context of what the Lord Jesus said in these verses, we will understand their spiritual meaning. There are four crucial steps in this portion.</p>
<p>The first crucial step is related to the spittle, which was something out of the Lord Jesus. In this portion <em>spittle</em> signifies something that comes out of the Lord Jesus, or we may say that it proceeds out of His mouth. Therefore, spittle signifies the words that proceed out of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; mouth (Matt. 4:4). John 6:63 says that the Lord&rsquo;s words are spirit and are life. Hence, spittle also signifies the Lord&rsquo;s words of life.</p>
<p>The second crucial step is related to the clay, which signifies man. The Bible says that man was made of clay (Job 33:6; Isa. 45:9; cf. Rom. 9:21). Therefore, the Lord&rsquo;s making clay of the spittle signifies that His word enters into and is mingled with men of clay.</p>
<p>The third crucial step is related to anointing the eyes of the blind. In the original text the word <em>anointed</em> in John 9:6 is related to the anointing of an ointment. This refers to the Holy Spirit as an ointment coming to anoint man. When the word of the Lord Jesus enters into man and is mingled with man, the Holy Spirit must come and anoint man. Man must let the Holy Spirit move in him in order to anoint his blindness.</p>
<p>Hence, if we want our inner eyes to be opened, we must take these three steps. The first step is for the word of the Lord Jesus to enter into us. The second step is to let the word of the Lord Jesus mingle with us. The third step is to let the Holy Spirit anoint us. After we read the Bible and spiritual publications or after we listen to a message, we should spend some time to ponder over what we have read or heard. Then the Lord&rsquo;s word will mingle with us, and the Holy Spirit will simultaneously anoint us through His moving and anointing. In John 8:12 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.&rdquo; It is possible to read this verse several times but not have the reality of this verse, because we have not allowed this word to enter into us and be mingled with us. However, if we read this verse and spend a few minutes to meditate on it, this word will mingle with us, and the Holy Spirit will anoint us. As a result, we will be enlightened to realize that we were previously in darkness but have now been enlightened by the life of the Lord Jesus. These three steps, however, are not sufficient. There is a fourth step.</p>
<p>The fourth crucial step is related to going and washing in the pool of Siloam. The word <em>Siloam</em> means &ldquo;sent,&rdquo; and it also means &ldquo;obedient.&rdquo; Obedience involves believing. Hence, going and washing indicate believing and obeying. If the blind man had not gone to the pool of Siloam to wash off the clay after being anointed, the clay would have blinded him even more. Likewise, if we do not believe and obey after hearing the Lord&rsquo;s word and being anointed by the Holy Spirit, we will become blinder. Let us consider John 8:12 again. Here the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;He who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness.&rdquo; Suppose someone has heard and understood this word but has neither believed nor obeyed it. He may say that this is merely the Lord&rsquo;s reasoning and may question how people living in the world today can be delivered from darkness. Such a thought indicates that he is not willing to &ldquo;go and wash in the pool of Siloam.&rdquo; As a result, he will become blinder.</p>
<p>Some people seem to be clear when they do not read the Bible, but they become confused when they read the Bible. This is the result of not believing or receiving what they have read in the Bible and of not obeying the work of the Holy Spirit in them. These people allow the Lord to anoint their eyes with the clay mingled with spittle, but they do not &ldquo;go and wash in the pool of Siloam&rdquo;; that is, they are unwilling to be sent and to obey. In the end, they become blinder.</p>
<p>The Lord ordered the blind man to go and wash in the pool of Siloam. There were many places with water in the land of Judah, so why did the blind man have to go and wash in the pool of Siloam? This was to test whether he would obey. When the blind man obeyed, his eyes were opened. When the Lord gives us a command, He is also testing us. We may consider the Lord&rsquo;s command as irrelevant, but our eyes will be opened if we obey.</p>
<p>It was not sufficient for the blind man to go to the pool of Siloam; he still had to wash away the clay, that is, to bury the clay in the water of the pool. Clay represents the self. The spiritual significance of going to the pool of Siloam and washing away the clay is to put the self to death by believing and obeying. This will open our inner eyes so that we will be able to see spiritual things.</p>
<p>Many people read the Bible, but they do not let the words of the Bible enter into them to mingle with them. Some people let the words of the Bible mingle with them, but they do not let the Holy Spirit operate and anoint them. A few may let the Holy Spirit operate and anoint them, but instead of believing and obeying, they preserve the self, the clay, and are unwilling to wash away the self. Therefore, their inner eyes are still blind, unopened. The self becomes a veil on their inner eyes. The self, the person of clay, is a veil that covers their eyes and takes away their sight.</p>
<p>Going and washing in the pool of Siloam signify believing and obeying. This is baptism. Baptism is included with believing and obeying. If you have believed in the Lord and received Him, the Lord says, &ldquo;Good. Go and be baptized.&rdquo; You should answer, &ldquo;I will go.&rdquo; This is to believe and obey. The Bible says that to be baptized is to bury our old man (Rom. 6:4, 6). Therefore, baptism puts the self to death; it does not preserve the self. This will open your inner eyes and enable you to see spiritual things.</p>
<p>We should not think that this interpretation is unfounded. This interpretation is based on our spiritual experience. Someone may listen to the words of the Bible, but the words will not benefit him if he does not let them mingle with him. Hebrews 4:2 speaks of this. The children of Israel heard the word of God, but they did not mix the word with faith; they did not allow God&rsquo;s word to be mingled with them. As a result, the word that they heard did not profit them. After the word is mingled with us, we still need to let the Holy Spirit move and anoint us. Then we also need to believe and obey. Finally, we need to put the self aside, in the place of death, without any reservation.</p>
<p>A person may have heard the gospel many times but with no result. However, one day when he is reading the Bible, he may notice Mark 16:16, which says, &ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved,&rdquo; and this time it is as if the Lord Jesus mixed His spittle with clay and anointed his eyes. The word that has proceeded out of the Lord&rsquo;s mouth is mingled with him, and the Holy Spirit works to anoint the Lord&rsquo;s word in him. At this juncture he feels that he should be baptized immediately. He is very clear within that the Lord wants him to be baptized. This is equivalent to the Lord telling him to go and wash in the pool of Siloam. Then he decides, &ldquo;Yes, I will go and be baptized.&rdquo; However, even though he has made the decision, he begins to consider other matters and is unwilling to immediately obey by being baptized in the water. As a result, there is a long delay. While he delays, there is a speaking within him: &ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved. Have you not decided to be baptized? Why are you still considering?&rdquo; Nevertheless, he does not obey. During this time, he is confused and befuddled when he listens to a message or reads the Bible. However, the Lord is not willing to let him go and questions him seriously, &ldquo;Are you still unwilling to be baptized? How long will you wait?&rdquo; If he obeys, he will be like the blind man whose eyes have been anointed with clay and knows that he must go and wash in the pool of Siloam. After he is baptized, he will be inwardly enlightened immediately. This indicates that the clay of his self has been washed away in the water. This is why his inner eyes are opened. From that day onward, the Bible will be open to him, and he will be able to listen to messages with understanding.</p>
<p>When the Lord&rsquo;s word is mingled with you and the Holy Spirit anoints you, you should believe and obey and put the self in the place of death. If you want to preserve the self, it will be a lump of clay covering the eyes of your heart and preventing you from seeing. If you take the four steps revealed in John 9 by receiving the Lord&rsquo;s word, letting the Lord&rsquo;s word be mingled with you, allowing the Holy Spirit to move and anoint you, and believing and obeying by putting the self to death, your inner eyes will have sight.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN BELIEVING IN THE SON OF GOD<br />
TO BECOME THE LORD&rsquo;S SHEEP</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus opened the eyes of the blind man, and then He led the blind man to know and believe that He is the Son of God (vv. 35-38). Man must believe that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God in order to have eternal life. When man&rsquo;s inner eyes are opened, he knows and believes that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God. By knowing the Lord Jesus and believing that He is the Son of God in order to receive eternal life, the blind man became the Lord&rsquo;s sheep and was able to hear the Lord&rsquo;s voice and understand His word. In spiritual matters hearing is seeing. When a person hears and understands the Lord&rsquo;s word, he sees the things spoken of by the Lord. Those who become the Lord&rsquo;s sheep have eternal life and are kept by the Lord&rsquo;s powerful hand and by the Father&rsquo;s loving hand. They are secure forever. This also means that they are saved. Such a salvation is not a salvation from ordinary things. Rather, it is a salvation in which the Lord opens man&rsquo;s eyes, gives man eternal life, and then keeps and protects him in His and the Father&rsquo;s hand. Let us sing a hymn.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The song I cannot sing.</p>
<p class="hymn-verse">There is springtime in my soul today,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For when the Lord is near<br />
The dove of peace sings in my heart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowers of grace appear.</p>
<p class="hymn-verse">There is gladness in my soul today,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hope, and praise, and love,<br />
For blessings which He gives me now,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For joys laid up above.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
