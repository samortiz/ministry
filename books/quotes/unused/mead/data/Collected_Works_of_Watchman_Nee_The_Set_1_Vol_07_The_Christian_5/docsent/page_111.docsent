   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BOOK REVIEWS Issue No. 6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the fourth issue, we have added this column, and many have echoed their approval.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Booksellers often use advertisements to attract people to buy their books.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Buyers are often cheated through oversight.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many booksellers have only one goal in mind, which is to make money.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They sell all kinds of books, from those which are orthodox in their faith to those which are not.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is not uncommon for pastors and preachers to spend some of their savings to buy useless books.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is why we want to review books and magazines in this column honestly, fairly, and scripturally, so that the readers will know what to choose.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Editor's note: Following this is a list of magazines whose faith is unscriptural, a list of magazines whose faith is mixed, and a list of magazines whose faith is pure.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Issue No. 7</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the last issue, we intended to publish a letter from Pastor Tsui Ai-kwang.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Unfortunately, the letter was lost.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What that letter said was mainly concerning the need for stern critical works on reviewing books and magazines in this age of apostasy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As for the reviews made in the issues prior to the last one, they were all done by the editor.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE PERSONAL WAY TO BE SAVED</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A few years ago, when I was a one-year-old believer, I obtained this book in English and received much help from it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Two years ago, I heard that it was translated into Chinese, but did not know who the publisher was and could not secure a copy for myself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although this book is small, it contains many practical points.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It also contains many moving stories.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Chapter seven on prayer is the most valuable article.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The author of the book is the founder of a certain group in England.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The group is not a church, but an organization established solely for the salvation of souls.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The method the group uses is to write down in notebooks names of friends and relatives according to the leading of the Spirit and to pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At the same time, the gospel would be shared with them until one by one they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When I first became a Christian, other than The Pilgrim's Progress, this book rendered me the most help.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>RIGHTLY DIVIDING THE WORD OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Writer: Scofield.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Publisher: Morning Star Publisher, Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Price: Five cents.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This book is a popular booklet among Western spiritual believers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The greatest problem with modern Bible expositions is that men do not rightly divide the teachings in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Instead, they mix up the teachings of various biblical dispensations, such as those for the Jews and those for the church, and those concerning grace and those concerning the law.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this book Dr. Scofield made clear distinctions between the different teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Those believers who want to study the Bible without confusion should study this book.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>CHRIST AND SOCIAL REFORM</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Writer:______.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Translator:______.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Price: Sixty cents.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The first point about this book is that it is too expensive.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A book with so-called social reform in its title is enough to make a person who firmly believes in the Bible sick at heart.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Those in the Young Men's Association group talk daily about social reforms.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But what I want to know is how many societies they have reformed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As long as the Christian church is here, it proves that the world cannot be reformed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If society can be reformed, then the Lord would have reformed it already.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Why is there still the need for the church to be established?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The word church in the original language means "the called-out ones."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If society can be reformed, one can live inside it; what need is there to be called out?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The writer wrote on page 10 about "the ideal society according to Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I do not know if the Lord Jesus showed one time what an ideal society should be.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The writer is a person who does not believe in the vicarious death of the Lord Jesus for sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He considers that the Lord Jesus only "sacrificed for His teaching," "was martyred for His teaching," and gave Himself to a "risky endeavor" p.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>20 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>More absurd than this is his assertion that the gospel that the Lord Jesus proclaimed was merely a "philosophy" p.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>22 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He thought that when the ideal society of the Lord Jesus would appear, all the good things would happen.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Later, he said that "such a world would be paradise indeed" p.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>22 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Can the world become a paradise through certain kinds of philosophies?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We know that the Bible never intends to reform the world.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God's intention in this age is to select men out of this world for His name Acts 15:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He is not selecting the whole of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In expounding the story of the rich man and Lazarus, the writer said, "The uneven distribution of wealth between the rich and the poor..filled Jesus with righteous indignation!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Probably He thought He could change this" p.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>26 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Fortunately, he used the word probably!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord Jesus never considered the uneven distribution of wealth between the rich and the poor as something that could be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The rich man was still rich at the time he died!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>And Lazarus was still poor at the time he died!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If there was any change at all, it was after they had died!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Yet even after they had died, there was still the distinction --Lazarus was still not with the rich man in the same place!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In talking about social struggles, the writer quoted 1 Corinthians 12:4-6, 17-22.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But I do not know how these verses can have anything to do with the social struggles that the writer talked about.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>On page 39 the writer talked about the "kingdom of heaven"; then on page 112 he explained the meaning of the "kingdom of heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The kingdom of heaven to him is just the ideal society of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He does not recognize the existence of a real kingdom and is the same as all the other modernists.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>On page 115 he said, "The new citizens are those who can build up Jesus' promised kingdom of heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>That means they do not necessarily have to be saved Christians!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Page 34 talks about how these new citizens come about; they come about through regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>"Jesus called regeneration the rejuvenating experience of confessing oneself to be a child and responding to the love of God."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Is this the regeneration that the Bible talks about?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Can one be regenerated just by "confessing oneself to be a child"?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The reason there is regeneration is that the "self" is unreliable.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Can one be regenerated without the bearing of sins on the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The writer did not recognize the total depravity of humanity either.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>"According to Jesus' teaching, everyone has a good nature within him and has the ability to do good" p.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>170 .</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He just said this capriciously and could not quote one verse to back him up.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We do not know how the writer would explain John 3:6.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Can those born of the flesh evolve into a spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The Lord Jesus thinks that it is impossible, that there is no goodness in man.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>On page 183 the writer mentioned the death of the Lord Jesus as "a martyrdom," and not an act of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The translation of this book is very fluent.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If a reader has the intention to study sociology, he will be impressed by the beauty of the style and will recognize the Lord Jesus as the best social reformer.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>But this book is completely useless, even harmful, to the salvation of the soul and to leading others to believe in the Lord as their Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>After reading this book, I was amazed by one thing: the writer only called Christ as "Jesus"; he did not call Him "Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The Judas of old and this writer today are of the same category.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>"No one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit" 1 Cor 12:3 .</S>
