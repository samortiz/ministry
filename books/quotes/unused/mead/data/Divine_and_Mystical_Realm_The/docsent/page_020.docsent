   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer: Lord, we can never forget what a mercy and what a grace that You are the Spirit, even the life-giving Spirit and the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Lord, You have created for us a human spirit, and in Your organic salvation the first thing You do is to regenerate our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Eventually, Lord, You put Yourself as such a Spirit in our spirit and mingled with our spirit to make us one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Oh, he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We can never forget all this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We worship You for this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Impress us and always remind us of our being one spirit with You.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do we live in our spirit with Your Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do we move in our spirit with Your Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lord, do we fellowship with You in our spirit with Your Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Lord, remind us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lord, speak to us that we may receive further visions.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this message we do not want to merely repeat the items of God's organic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Instead, we want to see that the key of God's organic salvation is the Spirit Himself with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not forget that there is such a marvelous phrase in the Bible in Romans 8:16.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even after we enter into the New Jerusalem, I would like to see a banner there saying "The Spirit Himself with our spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Spirit Himself with our spirit is doing one thing: witnessing that we are the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Just to say the people of God is not too critical, but to say the children of God is so great.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Spirit Himself is the witnessing One, and this Spirit is the Spirit of life, the Spirit who gives life, the Spirit who is the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This Spirit is also the pneumatic Christ and the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our spirit was created by God but became dead through the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But later it was regenerated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Not only so, after regeneration the regenerating Spirit remains in our regenerated spirit and mingles Himself with our spirit to make the two one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First Corinthians 6:17 says, "He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Not only are we God-men but also we are one with God, one spirit with God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The human spirit and the divine Spirit are not only joined and mingled but are also one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Spirit is life and the One who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God is the Spirit and in His marvelous organic salvation, He has made us one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is just a simple word in 1 Corinthians 6:17, but I never saw this truth until after I had studied the Bible for at least thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One day I realized that I am one spirit with God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Regretfully, even in the Lord's recovery, many of the elders and even the co-workers do not know their real status.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our real status is that we are one spirit with God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have been saved to such a high level.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What God is, we are.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we realize our status, this will affect our living.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When I speak with others in a joking way, I am inwardly rebuked for being so loose and light with no gravity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I am reminded about my status, and I have to confess to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Due to my divine status, I dare not be loose or light.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I dare not joke.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even with my grandchildren I dare not speak lightly, because I am not merely their grandfather.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I am a grandfather who has the same status as God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to 1 Corinthians 6:17 God's intention in His organic salvation is to join the believer's spirit with His Spirit as one spirit a mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Eventually, this is not just the mingled spirit but a spirit that is one spirit with God, that is the same as God in His life and nature but not in His Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the key to open the eight sections of the organic salvation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we do not have this key, the door is closed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we have this key, the door is open and we can see all things concealed within.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I. TO OPEN THE FIRST SECTION OF REGENERATION A. The Spirit of Reality Coming to Convict the Sinners</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Spirit of reality came to convict the sinners concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment John 16:8-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Sin is related to Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Adam is the source of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Righteousness is related to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Christ is our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The judgment must be Satan's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Here are Adam, the source of sin; Christ, the source of righteousness; and Satan, the one who should bear the judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the whole universe God's blame is not to anyone else but to him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The whole universe today is full of rebellion due to one archangel who is Satan, so judgment has to be his.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Sin came from Adam, righteousness is given from Christ, and judgment goes to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Spirit of reality came to convict us of this, causing us to repent of our fallen condition and enter into the death and burial of Christ Matt 3:2, 5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This conviction brought us to the death and resurrection of Christ to receive Him and be regenerated.</S>
