   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Churches Being Local in Administration</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>but Not Absolutely Independent</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is another important item from the Word that we have to realize.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The churches are surely local in their administration, but they are not absolutely independent.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In our history in the Lord's recovery, we were warned by the Brethren practice of autonomy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All the states of the United States have their own administrations and governments, but they are not strictly independent.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The states are separate to an extent, but this does not mean they are absolutely independent.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If the states were absolutely independent, the United States would not be one country.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It would become fifty countries.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The local churches are not absolutely independent.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the apostles kept their hands off of the affairs of the churches, this did not mean that each local church became one independent entity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Nor did it mean that since the churches were under the teaching of the apostles, they became a federation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 1 Corinthians 4:17, Paul says, "Because of this I have sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in every church."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In all the churches, the Apostle Paul taught the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His teaching was the same universally, not varying in any place.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Concerning this matter, we need to look at the seven epistles to the seven local churches in Revelation 2 and 3.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The word of the Lord to one church is the word spoken by the Spirit to all the churches Rev 2:1, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At the beginning of each epistle, it is the Lord speaking to a specific church 2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14 , but at the end of all the epistles, the Word says, "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches" 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What was said by the Lord to the church in Ephesus was the word that all the churches should hear.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every epistle was a particular word to a certain church, yet this particular word should be heard and taken by all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the one hand, the elders of the churches have the right and the position to carry out the local administration of the churches independently.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the other hand, all the churches should listen to the word that the apostles have received of God, which is the teaching of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the one hand, the churches are local separately.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the other hand, all the local churches are still the one Body of Christ which is an organism, not a federation which is an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to meet as local churches separately according to what the New Testament says, but all the local churches are still the one Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By the way, I would add a little word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In our fellowship many of us are used to saying, "Brother Lee says..."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I beg you, from now on, not to say, "Brother Lee says..."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead we should say, "First Timothy says..."; or "First Corinthians says..."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>From the very beginning of the Lord's recovery in the United States, I have passed on the Lord's word to you.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You may have received the Lord's word through my speaking, through my teaching, but what I spoke was His word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We all need to come back to the pure Word of God and discern accurately what His pure Word says.</S>
