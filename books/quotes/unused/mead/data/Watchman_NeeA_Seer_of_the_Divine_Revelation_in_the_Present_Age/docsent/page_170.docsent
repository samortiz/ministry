   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Early in 1950 Watchman Nee visited Hong Kong from the China mainland.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because a revival was brought there through his ministry, he cabled me in Taiwan, asking me to meet him there before he returned to China.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I replied that I was in the midst of an important conference in Taipei and would not be able to arrive in Hong Kong before he left.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His response was that as soon as I was free I should go to Hong Kong, regardless of whether he was still there or not, to arrange the service of the church there.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Eventually, on February 16, I went to Hong Kong and stayed there for one and a half months.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The following is a testimony of Brother Hsu Jin-chin, an elder in the church in Hong Kong during that period of time:</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the evening of February 15, 1950, Brother Nee told us, "This afternoon I received a cable from Brother Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He will be here tomorrow to fellowship with the elders and the responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I have also asked him to take the lead here.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Tomorrow he will arrive.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At that time I hope that you will receive him at the airport."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By then, I was an elder already, and I arranged to have the brothers and sisters receive him at the Kai-Tak airport the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the morning of the day after I arrived, Brother Nee took me to the meeting of co-workers and leading ones.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the presence of all, he said, "Brother Witness, according to the authority the Lord has given you, please make arrangements for all the service of the co-workers, the elders, and the deacons in the church here."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This was an assignment of tremendous responsibility, to lay a good foundation for the church service in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the evening he took me to the special meeting of the revival and asked me to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I said, "As long as you are present, I have no burden to speak."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He then continued to minister in those special meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the revival in Hong Kong, some brothers and sisters handed over their possessions to the work for the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Watchman asked me to share the responsibility with him in the arrangement for their disposal.</S>
