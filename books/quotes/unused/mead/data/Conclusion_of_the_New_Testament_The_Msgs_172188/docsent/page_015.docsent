   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because the authorities are from God, the believers should not resist them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"He who resists the authority opposes what God has appointed, and those who oppose will receive to themselves judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For the rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In being subject to the government, the believers should pay taxes and revenues to the authorities as God's officers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 13:6 Paul explains, "Because of this you also pay taxes; for they are God's officers, attending constantly to this very thing."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then in verse 7a he continues, "Render to all their dues: tax to whom tax is due, revenue to whom revenue."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Greek word rendered "officers" in verse 6 literally means public servants.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To pay tax and revenue indicates that we are subject to authority.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the one hand, the believers are in a good condition, enjoying a good country with a good government; on the other hand, the believers need to pay for this by paying taxes and revenues to the authorities as God's officers. d Fearing Them and Honoring Them</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Titus 3:1-8 Paul charges the saints to keep a good relationship with the government.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to the healthy teaching in the New Testament, we must respect the government.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 1 says, "Remind them to be subject to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready unto every good work."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be subject to rulers is to recognize God's authority and to respect His government over men.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To do every good work means to live a testimony for God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Before Paul could teach the saints to respect the government, he himself had to experience a certain amount of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When he was Saul of Tarsus, he was a patriotic Jew and wanted to be free from the yoke of the Roman imperialists.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But in Titus 3:1 he instructs the saints to subject themselves to rulers and authorities, being ready unto every good work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to Paul's word in Romans 13, governmental officials have been appointed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul recognized that even those officials appointed by Caesar were rulers appointed by God, His deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If Paul had not been transformed from a natural person into a spiritual person with a spiritual understanding, it would have been difficult for him to give such instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In like manner, we need to be transformed through the divine dispensing in order to be subject to rulers and to be ready unto every good work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have a proper relationship with the government not by ethical teachings, philosophical instructions, or by our natural life and ability but through our experience of the dispensing of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have a heavenly, divine, and spiritual supply that enables us to be subject to the government.</S>
