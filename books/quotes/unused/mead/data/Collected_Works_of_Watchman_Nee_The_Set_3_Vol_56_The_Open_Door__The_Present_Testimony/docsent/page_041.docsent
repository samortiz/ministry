   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Unity of Congregationalism</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now let us see the importance of the boundary of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Perhaps we first should look at history.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have seen that in the beginning the churches in the Bible were local.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Later, these churches were united to form provincial or district churches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Still later, they were united into an international church under the pope.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the churches were harmonious with God's purpose in the beginning, they were local.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Gradually, however, they degraded until there was only one church in the whole world, the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>During the Reformation, the Roman Catholic Church was broken up.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this breaking apart, the original local churches were not restored.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Subsequent to this breaking apart, the international church became national churches with state churches in different nations.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There was some improvement, some advancement, at this stage, with the churches being somewhat closer to the likeness of those in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The state churches later became independent churches.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Within a nation, there were scores, hundreds, and even thousands of small churches.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These independent churches took another step closer to the situation in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must realize how difficult it was for these independent churches to be established.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, the church in many nations insisted that sermons could only be preached in holy places.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These holy places were the dedicated sanctuaries.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>John Wesley rose up and said that preaching could be done anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was greatly persecuted!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The state church declared that messages preached in undedicated places were defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In addition to the place being dedicated, the person preaching the message had to be ordained; no ordinary person was allowed to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the reason Darby said that Paul, Peter, and John could not have preached according to this view, because they were not ordained.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For the state churches, preaching was serious, location was serious, and setting up new churches was even more serious.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even Luther, during the Reformation, dared not establish a church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It was the political power that forced him to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Nevertheless, after Wesley was raised up, the climate gradually changed as independent churches were established.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The international church had evolved into national churches, and the national churches had evolved into independent churches.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Among these independent churches, a doctrine that became quite prevalent was the so-called congregationalism, which means that every independent congregation is a church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Who believed in congregationalism?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was the Congregationalists and the Baptists.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What is meant by congregationalism?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many children of God among them in their reading of the Bible saw that the churches were all independent of one another.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The church in Jerusalem had its own administration, the church in Antioch took care of its own affairs, and the church in Corinth, as well as the church in Ephesus, also had its own administration.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although the church was universal, they thought that each congregation was the unit of church administration.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, it was called "congregationalism."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They set up congregational churches with each congregation serving as a church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There was no archbishop above them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Compared with the other independent churches, this was an improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now we see progress in these various stages; the international church improved to become national churches, national churches improved to become independent churches, and some independent churches improved to become congregational churches.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Mistake of Congregationalism</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Congregationalism is actually very close to the Bible, but it goes a little beyond the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Congregationalist brothers studied the Bible but failed to discover the thought of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Jerusalem is a city, not a congregation; Antioch is a city, not a congregation; Ephesus is a port city, not a congregation; Colossae is a city on a hill, not a congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They thought that Jerusalem, Antioch, Ephesus, and Colossae were congregations, and they concluded that congregations were independent of each other.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Church history tells us that not long after its beginning, the church deteriorated until the time of Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Afterward there was a recovery, an improvement, until the stage of the independent churches.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>From the time of the independent churches, the church went to another extreme of taking a congregation as the unit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This included Congregationalists and Baptists and later even the Open Brethren who also went to the extreme of considering a congregation as the unit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now I wish to discuss the reason that congregationalism is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is the closest to the Bible; yet it is still wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord desires that we love one another, receive one another, and avoid envy, strife, and divisions in the same local church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The unity of congregationalism takes the congregation as its unit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This poses a problem in that it is difficult to pin down such a thing as a congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There may be one congregation at 145 Nanyang Road and another at 143 Nanyang Road.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If I love the brothers at 145 Nanyang Road, I will meet with them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When I disagree with them, I will set up another congregation at 143 Nanyang Road.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we have seen that unity is a matter of locality, we could only go and set up a church in another city, not another one in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is not easy, but still we must love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Oh, how great is the Lord's wisdom in putting us in localities and giving us the locality as the boundary!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Only here can we really find the cross to bear and the lessons to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What is the meaning of a congregational church?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It means that there can be several congregations within each locality, each having a unity within itself and each independent of the others.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is a very serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The unity of congregationalism is a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The mistake of the international church goes to one extreme, causing many localities to have one church, but the mistake of the congregational churches goes to the opposite extreme, causing one locality to have many churches.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Roman Catholic Church is at one end, with many localities having one church, and the congregational churches are at the other end, with one locality having many churches.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is like a pendulum that swings to one side with many localities having one church and then swings to the other side with one locality having five to ten churches.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the last century the Brethren were raised up, but some of them fell into congregationalism.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They were mainly separated into the Closed Brethren and the Open Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Closed Brethren are still on the side of the united church; the Open Brethren have gone to the other side and become congregations, "chapel" assemblies.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They may have one assembly on one street and another assembly on another street, each having nothing to do with the other.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This means they have many churches in one locality.</S>
