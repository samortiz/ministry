   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Strengthened by the Apostles Paul and Silas</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After the churches were established in Syria and Cilicia, Paul and Silas were sent by the apostles from Jerusalem to strengthen them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Such a strengthening implies a confirmation, recognition, by the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>E. Turning to Asia Minor 1.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Churches Established in the Cities of Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch in the Province of Galatia the Churches in Galatia</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Acts 14:21-23 refers to the churches established in the cities of Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After Paul and Barnabas brought the good news to the city of Derbe and made a considerable number of disciples vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>20-21a , "they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch'' v. 21b . This is not the Antioch from which they were sent out on this journey of ministry 13:1 ; rather, it is the Antioch in Pisidia, the Antioch in Asia Minor.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The churches in these cities were "the churches of Galatia'' Gal 1:2 , a province of the ancient Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Through Paul's preaching ministry churches were established in a number of cities in that province.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, "churches,'' not "church,'' is used when Paul refers to them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Elders Appointed in Every One of These Churches</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Elders were appointed in every one of the churches in Galatia.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Acts 14:23 says, "When they had appointed elders for them in every church, having prayed with fastings, they committed them to the Lord in whom they had believed.''</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Greek words rendered "in every church'' contain the preposition kata with the distributive usage according to church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The phrase "in every church'' in 14:23 equals "in each city'' in Titus 1:5.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The comparison of these phrases indicates not only that the jurisdiction of a local church is that of the city in which it is located, but also that in one city there should be only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The eldership of a local church should cover the entire city where that church is.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Such a unique eldership in a city preserves the unique oneness of the Body of Christ from damage.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One city should only have one church with one eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This practice is illustrated, beyond any question and doubt, by the clear pattern in the New Testament Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rom 16:1; 1 Cor 1:2; Rev 1:11 , and it is an absolute prerequisite for the maintenance of proper order in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All the churches in which the elders were appointed respectively by the apostles in Acts 14:23 were established within less than one year.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, the elders appointed in these churches could not have been well matured.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They must have been considered elders because they were comparatively the most matured among the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They were not voted in by their congregation; they were appointed by the apostles according to their maturity in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They were charged by the apostles to care for the leadership and shepherding in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>F. Spreading to the Province of Asia in Asia Minor 1.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Churches Established in the Cities of Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Revelation 1:4 speaks of "the seven churches which are in Asia,'' and verse 11 says, "What you see write in a book and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.''</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Asia was a province of the ancient Roman Empire in which were the seven cities mentioned in verse 11.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The seven churches were in those seven cities respectively, not all in one city.</S>
