<h1 class="title">THE PRACTICE OF CHANGING THE SYSTEM</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, our heart is filled with praises toward the throne. We worship You for calling and gathering us out of this busy age. We treasure this time&mdash;You called and gathered us here to meet in Your name. Lord, we ask You to visit us and bring us into Your heart&rsquo;s desire that we may have thorough fellowship in You. Lord, open Yourself to us, open the heavens to us, reveal Your word to us, unveil Your economy to us, and show us what You intend to do today. We also ask You to shine on us that we would not have anything hidden, any covering, or any shadow, but that we would be absolutely in the light and under an open sky to have open fellowship with one another through Your open word.</p>
<p>Lord, we ask You again to open Your will to us that we may see the way You want to take today. Give us an open mind and an open spirit; even more, give us an open word. We truly long to have open fellowship. We pray that You would save us. We desire to be delivered from this age, this religious world, and to come forward to live to You. Lord, may You have mercy on us. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REASON FOR CHANGING THE SYSTEM</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will continue our fellowship concerning the practice of changing the system. I would like to mention again, brothers and sisters, the purpose of changing the system. On the negative side, changing the system will deliver us from traditional religion, and on the positive side, restore the living and organic function of every member of the Body so that Christ and His Body can spread. Although we use the expression <em>change the system,</em> we are not merely changing a method or a system; rather, our purpose is to spread the Lord and His Body in His recovery in the present age. In order to reach this goal, we must first be delivered from the religion that binds us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christianity Killing the Organic Function<br />
of the Believers</h2>
<p>Some brothers in America recently gathered some statistics. In the past we always thought that Christianity was the most powerful religion, the most widespread, persuasive, and capable of gaining people. But I was shocked when I saw the statistics. According to the statistics, in the past fifty years Islam had a five hundred percent increase, Hinduism a hundred seventeen percent increase, and Buddhism a sixty-seven percent increase, but Christianity had only a forty-seven percent increase. Christianity has a low rate of increase because it has become a religion that binds people, that kills the organic function of the believers.</p>
<p>The Catholic Church has the largest membership in Christianity; almost one-fourth of the world&rsquo;s population today are Catholics. Among them, however, it is difficult to find one out of a thousand or even ten thousand who functions organically. Concerning the Protestant churches, we can use Taiwan as an example. The Presbyterian church came to Taiwan from Scotland about a century ago. Now after more than one hundred years, it has fewer than 100,000 members on the whole island of Taiwan. According to the statistics of Taiwan, which I saw a few years ago, the Presbyterian church has the largest membership, but still it has only about 80,000 Christians. Next is the Lord&rsquo;s recovery with about 47,000 members. The third is the True Jesus Church with about 20,000 members, most of whom are aborigines. Today Taiwan has a population of about twenty million, but the number of Christians is fewer than 500,000. The total number of believers from the three biggest groups is only about 150,000. This deserves our consideration.</p>
<p>The reason for such a situation is that, on the one hand, Christianity preaches the gospel and teaches the truth; on the other hand, it binds people with its system. It saves people on the one hand, but it binds them on the other. It enlivens people, but it also kills them. We may say that baptisms in Christianity are truly burials. When people are baptized, their organic function is altogether buried; very few can escape from this. This proves that the practice of Christianity is a &ldquo;dead end&rdquo; street; it is a terrible way. What about us? We have been in Taiwan for almost forty years. We began our work in Taiwan thirty-seven years ago, but we still have not been able to gospelize the small island of Taiwan.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Early Practice in Taiwan</h2>
<p>I had said that when we first came to Taiwan, we tried our best to rid ourselves of the old ways and endeavored to preach the gospel. At that time the population of Taipei was fewer than 500,000. First, we decided to print gospel tracts. We determined that the number of the gospel tracts that we would print would be equal to the number of residents in Taipei, because we wanted the gospel to enter every home in the city. Using a map, we divided the city into many small districts and gave the gospel tracts to the saints, asking them to go to every street and alley in each district to put a gospel tract in the mailbox of every house. Within a week, almost every household in Taipei had received a gospel tract from us.</p>
<p>Second, we sent out gospel teams to march on the street to spread the atmosphere of the gospel. We went to every street and alley in all the different districts, not only on the Lord&rsquo;s Day afternoons but also during the week. We went in large teams and in small teams, holding lanterns, beating drums, and marching on the streets to preach the gospel. Third, we printed many banners such as: &ldquo;Believe in Jesus to receive eternal life,&rdquo; &ldquo;God loves the world,&rdquo; &ldquo;Prepare to meet your God,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners.&rdquo; We posted them at train stations, bus stations, intersections, and on the door of every saint so that the banners could be seen everywhere in the city. Fourth, every Lord&rsquo;s Day afternoon we preached the gospel in the New Park where the amphitheatre could hold three thousand people. We would receive at least four to five hundred gospel information cards every Lord&rsquo;s Day. The following day, on Monday evening, the brothers and sisters would gather together to receive lists of names grouped according to their addresses. Then the saints would go to visit them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Through these four practices, we gained tens of thousands of people. At that time, we also determined not to contact those who were in Christianity. In the practice of our church life, we would not reject any of them who would come to us, but we would not take the initiative to contact them. Instead, we went only to the unbelievers. This was the reason for our success. Later, under the influence of the traditions of Christianity, we slowed down and made little advance. Hence, our changing the system today is primarily a change of concept and practice.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_030.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_032.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 1: The Vision and Definite Steps for the Practice of the New Way &nbsp; pg 31</div><br></body></html>
