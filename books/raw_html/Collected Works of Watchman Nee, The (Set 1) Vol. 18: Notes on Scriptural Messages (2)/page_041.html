<P>Brothers and sisters, we must suffer for the Lord and willingly pay the price to take this way. We must love the Lord so that He can reveal His glory to us.</P><P>James 1:12 says, "Blessed is the man who endures trial, because when he has become approved by testing, he will receive the crown of life, which He promised to those who love Him." We often think of the labor we need to perform in order to obtain a crown of life. However, one of the conditions required to gain the crown is to love the Lord. Brothers and sisters, our love toward God is lacking! It seems as if we have already lost our first love! This is most regrettable!</P><P>In John 21 the Lord asked Peter if he loved Him and told him to feed His lambs. If someone truly loves the Lord, he will definitely care for people's souls. One cannot love the Lord while neglecting the souls of men. You must care for the souls of your colleagues, relatives, and whoever is close to you.</P><P>John 14:28 says, "If you loved Me, you would rejoice because I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I." When we love the Lord, we will not only love the brothers and keep God's commandments, but we will also rejoice that the Lord Jesus went to the Father. In other words, we will surely rejoice that the Lord Jesus has gone to the Father to obtain His glory. This is too profound! Many have no realization of the magnitude of glory when the Lord ascended to the Father who is greater than He. Without such a realization, we cannot worship God. We care that those we love will obtain glory, but if we love the Lord, we will definitely rejoice at the Lord's going to the Father.</P><P>Matthew 10:37 and 38 say, "He who loves father or mother above Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter above Me is not worthy of Me; and he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me." After reading these two verses, we should realize that only by dropping all considerations can we love the Lord more dearly. A certain believer remarked that when we worship, we should not only be aware of God's greatness but also of His loveliness. This is a most meaningful word. We come before Him and draw near to Him because of His loveliness.</P><P>How does God love us? The Bible speaks a great deal about God's loving us. Concerning the individual aspect, it says that He "loved me and gave Himself up for me" (Gal. 2:20). Concerning the corporate aspect, it says that "Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her" (Eph. 5:25). Romans 5:8 tells us that "God commends His own love to us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." First John 4:10 says, "Herein is love, not that we have loved God but that He loved us and sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins." He loved us and sent His Son to die for us. There is no love apart from the cross. Why did the Lord ordain that we break bread once a week? The Lord did not want us to forsake Him or forget Him; He wants to draw us back. If we recall the pain of being sinners and the greatness of the Lord's salvation towards us, how can we not love Him? In the wilderness, the Israelites thought of the melons and leeks of Egypt, forgetting Pharaoh's torment with the pain of slavery and God's deliverance of them out of their anguish. Their hearts would not give up Egypt. If we forget the cross, we will forget God's love; when we forget God's love, we cannot but think of the world.</P><P>How can we love God? Luke 7:47 says, "For this reason I say to you, Her sins which are many are forgiven, because she loved much; but to whom little is forgiven, he loves little." If we would only recall how our sins were forgiven, we cannot help but love the Lord. The day the cross ceases to inspire you, you have already fallen. Mr. Evan Roberts wept for months over his inability to receive the cross's inspiration until God touched him. The result was the mighty revival in Wales. Since then there has not been a more prevailing revival. The woman could wash the Lord's feet with her tears, wipe them with her hair, and kiss them with her mouth because she remembered that her sins had been forgiven.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, we must stand beneath the cross. Even if our spiritual condition becomes a hundredfold stronger, we should still remember how our sins have been forgiven.</P><P>First Corinthians 16:22 says, "If anyone does not love the Lord, let him be accursed! The Lord comes!" This is a most serious word! If anyone does not love the Lord, he is accursed.</P><P>Ephesians 6:24 says, "Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruptibility." To whom is grace given here? God gives it to those who love the Lord in incorruptibility. If others would ask you, "Do you believe in the Lord?", the whole world would marvel if you answer, "I am one who loves the Lord."</P><P>First Peter 1:8 says, "Whom having not seen, you love; into whom though not seeing Him at present, yet believing, you exult with joy that is unspeakable and full of glory." This verse says that we love Him because we believe in Him. What is born out of this love through believing? It is joy that is unspeakable and full of glory.</P><P>Finally, brothers and sisters, I wish to repeat what that old believer said to the departing young man: "May you be a passionate lover of the Lord Jesus!"</P>
