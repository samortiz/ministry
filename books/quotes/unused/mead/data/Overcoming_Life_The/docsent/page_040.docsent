   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE JUST LIVING BY FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some brothers have asked whether this means that we will no longer sin after we have experienced victory.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>My answer is that eventually we will realize everything in our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But in the meantime, there is still the possibility of sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to the Bible, what kind of life should we live?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Bible shows us that the life of a Christian is a life of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The righteous shall have life and live by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The righteous receive life by faith; this is the initial experience.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The righteous also live by faith; this is the ongoing experience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There are two worlds before us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One is the physical world, and the other is the spiritual world.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we exercise our physical organs, we are living in the physical world.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But when we exercise our faith, we are living in the spiritual world.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we exercise our eyes to look at ourselves, we are still sinners; we are still unclean, proud, and no better than any other person in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But when we exercise faith to look at ourselves in Christ, we see that our temper and stubbornness are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everything is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There are two worlds today, and every day we have to make a choice between them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Man has a mind, an emotion, and a will.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our will is free; therefore, we live in the world that we choose.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we live according to the senses of our physical organs in the physical world, we will substantiate the physical world.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we live by faith in the spiritual world, we will substantiate the spiritual world.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In other words, when we exercise our senses, we live in Adam, but when we exercise our faith, we immediately live in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are always between these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we live by our senses, we live in Adam, and when we live by faith, we live in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we live in Christ, everything in Christ will be our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Bible never teaches that sin can be eradicated.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But once a believer has entered the overcoming life, according to the principle of God s work and according to His provision and His commandments, such a person should no longer sin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is possible for us to express Christ every day, and it is possible for us to more than conquer every day.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But the minute we live in our feelings and by our feelings, we will immediately fail.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Brothers and sisters, we have to live by faith daily; only then can we substantiate everything in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>BEING RECOVERED BY THE BLOOD</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>IMMEDIATELY AFTER FAILURE</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What should we do if we fail accidentally?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should come immediately to God and put our sins under His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The very next moment, we can look to the Lord and say, God, I thank and praise You because Your Son is still my life and my holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He will live out His overcoming life from within me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We can be recovered within a second.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is no need to wait for five minutes or an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God forgives and cleanses us, but we think that we should feel sorry for ourselves a little longer and suffer a little more punishment before we are thoroughly cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is just asking for trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are living by our feelings and merely prolonging our ties to Adam for another hour or two.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some may ask, If a man still fails and needs the cleansing of the blood after he has entered the overcoming experience, is he not the same as those who never have the overcoming experience?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Brothers and sisters, there is a big difference.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Before one overcomes, his life is a total failure.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Occasionally he may overcome, but he fails habitually and repeatedly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, after he has overcome, his life becomes a victorious life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If he fails, it is an occasional failure; on the whole, he overcomes continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is a big difference between the two!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The difference is too great!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Formerly, it was mostly failure and occasional victory.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now it is mostly victory and occasional failure.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Before one overcomes, the failures are repetitious.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Those who lose their temper always lose their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Those whose thoughts are unclean always have unclean thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Those who are stubborn are always stubborn, those who are narrow-minded are always narrow-minded, and those who are jealous are always jealous.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Every time one fails, he fails in the same things, and victory is rare.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A person is habitually bound by his temper, pride, jealousy, or lying.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After he goes through the overcoming experience, he will fail only occasionally, and when he fails, he will not commit the same sin over and over again.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When he sins, it will be different than before.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Before a person overcomes, he will be at a loss as to what to do once he fails.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He will not know how to recover his fellowship with God and how to receive God s light once again.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He will feel that he is at the bottom of a long flight of stairs and will not know how to climb back up.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>After he has overcome, he may still fail occasionally, but within a few seconds, he will be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He will immediately confess his sins and be cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He can thank and praise the Lord at once, and Christ will live out His victory from within him once again.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is the great difference between overcoming and not overcoming.</S>
