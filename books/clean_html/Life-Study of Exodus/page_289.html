<h2 class="head2">A. Signifying Christ</h2><p>The propitiatory cover signifies Christ as the cover of God&rsquo;s righteous law. It also signifies Him as the place where God speaks to His redeemed people in grace. Hence, the propitiatory cover equals God&rsquo;s throne of grace (Heb. 4:16).</p><h2 class="head2">B. Made of Pure Gold</h2><p>Verse 17 says that the propitiatory cover was made of pure gold. Gold here signifies Christ&rsquo;s pure divine nature.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Size</h2><p>The size of the propitiatory cover was &ldquo;two cubits and a half its length, and a cubit and a half its width.&rdquo; The dimensions of the propitiatory cover signify a testimony.</p><h2 class="head2">D. With Two Cherubim</h2><p>Exodus 25:18 says, &ldquo;And you shall make two cherubim of gold; of beaten work you shall make them, from the two ends of the propitiatory cover.&rdquo; The cherubim signify God&rsquo;s glory (Ezek. 10:18; Heb. 9:5). We do not know whether or not the cherubim are angels, but we do know that they are related to God&rsquo;s glory. Hebrews 9:5 speaks of the cherubim of glory, and Ezekiel 10:18 says that God&rsquo;s glory left the temple and stood above the cherubim. Thus, the cherubim are related to God&rsquo;s glory and signify His glory. The cherubim on the propitiatory cover indicate that Christ expresses God&rsquo;s glory, that God&rsquo;s glory shines out from Him. The cherubim were on the cover, and the cover is Christ. This means that the glory of God shines out of Christ and upon Christ.</p><p>The cherubim were made of gold, of Christ&rsquo;s divine nature, and they were made of beaten work, indicating Christ&rsquo;s sufferings.</p><p>Verse 19 says, &ldquo;And make one cherub from this end, and one cherub from that end; from the propitiatory cover you shall make the cherubim upon its two ends.&rdquo; The cherubim on the two ends of the propitiatory cover signify testimony. The fact that the cherubim were one with the propitiatory cover indicates that God&rsquo;s glory comes out of Christ being the propitiatory cover to be a testimony.</p><p>Verse 20 says, &ldquo;And the cherubim shall spread out their wings above, covering over with their wings the propitiatory cover, with their faces each toward the other; toward the propitiatory cover the faces of the cherubim shall be.&rdquo; The wings of the cherubim covered the propitiatory cover. This means that God&rsquo;s glory is expressed in Christ to be a full testimony. The faces of the cherubim were toward each other and toward the propitiatory cover. This signifies that God&rsquo;s glory watches over and observes what Christ has done.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Put upon the Ark from Above</h2><p>Verse 21 says, &ldquo;And you shall put the propitiatory cover upon the ark from above, and into the ark you shall put the testimony which I shall give you.&rdquo; Here we are told that the propitiatory cover was put upon the ark from above. This signifies Christ as the propitiatory cover covering the law within the ark.</p><h2 class="head2">F. God Meeting with His Redeemed People Here</h2><p>The first part of verse 22 says, &ldquo;And I will meet with you there.&rdquo; This indicates that God met with His people in the propitiating Christ.</p>
