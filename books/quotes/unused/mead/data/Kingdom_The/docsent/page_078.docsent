   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BOOK OF REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to the harvest in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The seed is in Matthew, its growth is in the Epistles, and the harvest is in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The picture of the city presented in Revelation 21 and 22 is very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>That city is not built of clay or bricks.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All the cities constructed by the enemy as counterfeit buildings were made of bricks.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The tower of Babel was built with bricks Gen 11:3 , as were also the two cities of Pharaoh built by the enslaved Israelites Exo 1:11, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Bricks are composed of mud plus human work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God never builds this way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His building is composed of gold, pearls, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It has nothing of mud and the work of human hands.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's building is marvelous in our eyes because it is altogether His doing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No man can manufacture the materials for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Gold, pearls, and precious stones are produced by God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every part of the New Jerusalem has been transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the center of this city is the throne of God Rev 22:1, 3 , indicating the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The throne signifies the ruling authority.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The ruling and reigning of God are there.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Out of the throne proceeds a river of life that waters the entire city, and within the river of life grows the tree of life that feeds the city Rev 22:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a picture signifying that watering and feeding produce growth, transformation, and building.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the harvest of the seed sown in Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A FORETASTE</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not have to wait until the future to enjoy feeding, watering, growing, transformation, and building.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We in the Lord's recovery of the churches are qualified and privileged to have a foretaste now.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Of course, we do not yet have the full taste, but the foretaste indicates that the full taste is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The sisters have a foretaste of a meal in the kitchen before putting it on the table.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The foretaste is indicative of the full taste.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Actually, the foretaste of a meal is exactly the same as the full taste, but on a smaller scale.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The foretaste cannot be salty and the full taste sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The full taste which will be in the New Jerusalem is what we enjoy in the local churches today as the foretaste.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The full taste includes the river of life, the tree of life, growth, transformation, and building.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What about Bible knowledge and gifts?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They are not to be found in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the New Jerusalem we can see the river of life and the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We see growth, transformation, and building.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We see a city constructed with gold, pearls, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is all we can see.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since these are the items of the full taste, we should not add other things to the foretaste.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Rather, we should enjoy these items of the foretaste.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Revelation 21 and 22 show us a complete picture of the kingdom as our full taste.</S>
