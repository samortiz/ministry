   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX PRIVATE TALKS 4 Date: 1934</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Foochow ON THE ASSEMBLY IN FOOCHOW AND ON DIVISION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Editor's Note: In 1934 there was a meeting in She-Er-Jen-Pai, a district in the city of Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The meeting was not a part of any denomination, and it had knowledge of the church in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The leaders of that meeting were a Miss Ding Shu-shin and John Wang.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Brother K. H. Weigh as well as Watchman Nee's mother met with this assembly at one time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Miss Ding was opposed to the practice of head covering and later also sought for the experience of the baptism of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Brother Weigh did not agree with her stand of opposing the head covering.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The following are records of Brother Nee's talk with Brother Weigh concerning the subject and Brother Nee's advice.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since its severance from the denominations, the meeting in She-Er-Jen-Pai has never stood clearly on the proper ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is a historical fact.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This puts it at a distance from the other assemblies.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Its initial testimony was merely a testimony for the truth of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Later, it advanced to stand for the truth of baptism and then for the truth of the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But it was never clear about the church ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As far as church ministry is concerned, it should submit itself to the assemblies which have advanced further in this aspect of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The late-comers should submit to the early-comers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, it is only proper for the newly raised assembly in Swatow to follow the practice of the church in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>July 31</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This time my coming to Foochow is only for settling general questions.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The local problems in Foochow should be settled by the local brothers themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our problem with the meeting in Tsing-Tao-Kuan is a moral issue.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is related to the setting up of the Lord's table meeting there.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We cannot participate in the breaking of bread in that meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, our problem with She-Er-Jen-Pai has to do with the truth, such as the truth concerning head covering.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can only take one of two stands concerning the head covering with respect to the forbidding of the head covering in She-Er-Jen-Pai .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Either we go to the meeting and cover our head, or we do not go to the meeting at all.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Both stands are correct see 1 Cor 11:3-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is unreasonable for She-Er-Jen-Pai to demand that others take off their head covering.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Miss Ding demanded that everyone take off their head covering while waiting to be clear about the Lord's will.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>She also said that since most people did not cover their head, the minority should go along with the majority and wait on the Lord's leading in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But why would she not ask those who have not covered their head to cover their head while waiting on the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Suppose the majority of them covered their head.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Would Miss Ding also cover her head to wait on the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Miss Ding said that humanity as a whole already has its head covered in the order of God's creation and that there is no need to have a physical sign.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I would ask, "If we are dead in Christ already, why do we have to be baptized?"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Miss Ding left the denominations through the help of Hwa Wei-cheng's Bible teachings at Tien-An Chapel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You do not have to argue with her about her isolated issues one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This probably refers to such issues as head covering.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All you have to do is to ask, "What right does a man have to express his opinion before God or to question God?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Rom 9:19-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Toward God's Word there is no need for us to ask why.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As long as we know that it is God's Word, that is enough."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those whose flesh is not thoroughly crucified often ask why.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even many preachers often try to study the "whys."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But a spiritual man does not ask why; he only asks what.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Moreover, according to the teaching of the Bible, a woman does not have any place in teaching the truths 1 Cor 14:34; 1 Tim 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We see no such thing in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Even if Miss Ding is opposed to the matter of head covering, she should not be teaching this as a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the event that there is a division in She-Er-Jen-Pai, it will not be the result of a dispute concerning head covering.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There have been a series of factors accumulating throughout the years, leading to the present outbreak.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>July 25</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Of course, I have to say a word to you as well.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You were wrong as well.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you were unhappy with the meeting in She-Er-Jen-Pai in any way, you should have discussed it with the responsible ones there and not have criticized them behind their backs.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>August 2</S>
