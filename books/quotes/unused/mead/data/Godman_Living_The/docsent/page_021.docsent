   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GOD-MAN LIVING MESSAGE SIX A WORD OF DEFINITION 2 OUTLINE The devil s first stratagem in tempting the first God-man to ignore His human status of being a man Matt 4:3-4: In His anointing the first God-man, God declared that He was His beloved Son Matt 3:17.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Based upon God s declaration that the first God-man was His beloved Son, the devil exercised his first stratagem, tempting the first God-man to ignore that He was a man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But the first God-man defeated His tempter by standing firmly in His position of a man and answering him by saying, Man shall not live..., insisting to indicate that He was a man Matt 4:4.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The devil s second stratagem in tempting the first God-man to assume His divinity of being the Son of God Matt 4:5-7: Again, it was based upon what God declared the first God-man was.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The devil exercised his second stratagem, tempting the first God-man to assume His divinity by having a miracle of protection by the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the first God-man overcame His subtle tempter by saying, You shall not test the Lord your God, indicating strongly that He was a man before God who should not test the Lord His God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God in His eternal economy wanted to have a man as one of His creatures to deal with His enemy Satan, another creature, but the enemy tempted the first God-man to assume His divinity as the Creator of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By this subtle way, Satan mixed up the levels of God as the Creator and Satan himself as a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The devil s third stratagem in seducing the first God-man to love the glory of the kingdoms of the world, worshipping him as God and serving him as his subordinate Matt 4:8-11; Luke 4:5-8: It should have been that in the preadamic age, God appointed the archangel to be the head of the preadamic age Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>28:13-14 , and the authority and glory of the kingdoms of the earth should have been given to him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After he rebelled against God and became God s enemy, Satan, he was judged by God Isa 14:12-15 , but the full execution of God s judgment upon him will not be completed until the end of the millennium Rev 20:7-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, until that time he has authority over the kingdoms of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In his subtle temptation of the Lord, he offered the earthly kingdoms and their glory to the first God-man as a bait to hook Him so that He would worship him as God and serve him as his subordinate.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But the first God-man saw through the evil tempter s devilish device and conquered him by chasing him away and telling him in a shaming way that as a man before God He would worship God and serve Him only.</S>
