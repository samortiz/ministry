   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DEFINED GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we have the living Word with the written Word, we have the defined God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because God is abstract, mysterious, and invisible, there is the need for God to be the Word in order to explain Himself, define Himself, reveal Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Word in John 1:1 refers to the defined God, the explained God, the expressed God, the revealed God, the God made known to human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Word in John 1:1 refers to our Lord, the living Word, with the Bible, the written Word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Revelation 19:11-13 we have a picture of Christ judging and making war.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 13 says, "And He is clothed with a garment dipped in blood; and His name is called The Word of God."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The name on the Lord's thigh may be likened to a badge, label, or sign.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As He fights against the enemy, He wears a sign saying "The Word of God."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This indicates that the Lord Himself is the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do you want to know God?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order to know God, you need to read Christ, study Christ, behold Christ, contemplate Christ, gaze on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, we cannot know the Lord, the living Word, simply by studying Him or contemplating Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We also need the Book, the Bible, the written Word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we would know God, on the one hand we need to contemplate this living Person and, on the other hand, we need to study the Book.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have seen that the Word in John 1:1 refers both to the living Word and the written Word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Word in this verse is great!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This Word is actually God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Throughout the centuries there has been much debate among theologians concerning John 1:1.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have pointed out that, according to John 1:1, Christ is God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Others claim that the last part of this verse should not be translated, "and the Word was God," but should be rendered, "and the Word was deity."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some who prefer this translation deny that Jesus Christ is the very God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They may say that He is deity, but not that He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They may hold the concept that the Lord Jesus is the Logos and is deity, but deny that He is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE TRIUNE GOD DEFINED IN A LIVING PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Word in John 1:1 is the Triune God defined in a living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That living Person is not only the Son of God He is the entire God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Speaking of Christ, Colossians 2:9 says, "For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is difficult to define the word "fullness" as it is used in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Can you explain the difference between fullness and riches?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some who are familiar with what we have written elsewhere may say that the riches are what Christ is and the fullness is what we become as Christ's Body as a result of enjoying Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, this explanation is not so helpful here.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to biblical usage, the significance of the word "fullness" surpasses that of the word "riches."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Fullness is more formal.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First we have the riches and then the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We may say, therefore, that fullness surpasses riches.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Colossians 2:9 says that the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This fullness does not dwell in Christ theoretically or invisibly; it dwells in Him bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What does the expression "the fullness of the Godhead" refer to?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Does it not refer to the entire Godhead, to the complete Person of God?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Yes, the fullness of the Godhead is the entire Godhead, including the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Godhead comprises the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How, then, could we say that the fullness of the Godhead includes only God the Son and not also God the Father and God the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This would not be logical.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since the Godhead comprises the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, the fullness of the Godhead must be the fullness of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead, Christ is not only the Son of God, but, the entire God.</S>
