<h1 class="title">NOT DOING A TEARING DOWN WORK<br />
IN THE CHURCH SERVICE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">OUR SERVICE NEEDING TO PRODUCE THE BUILDING</h2>
<p>The building of the church is carried out through the administration of the church and the ministry of the word, both of which depend on the condition of our person. Our administration of the church might not result in much building up of the church. It is also possible that our ministry of the word might not result in much building up of the church. Even our bringing people to salvation and helping the saints to be edified might not result in much building up of the church. Our work may be effective, but the more we work, the less there is the element of building. In other words, the effectiveness of our work is inversely proportional to the building up of the church. This is the tearing down of God&rsquo;s building work, not its building up.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, the more we work, the more we build. Our work should be our building. For example, when some preach the gospel, they not only save sinners but also build up the church; when they edify the saints, they not only help the saints but also build up the church. We need to take heed to this one thing: we may work without producing the building. If we are in the light, we will see that it is possible to save sinners and edify the saints without building up the church. Many works in Christianity are tearing down the work of God&rsquo;s building. The most serious tearing down of God&rsquo;s building in the church is not the result of persecution or opposition from the unbelievers. It is the result of the many zealous works in Christianity. These works do not come out of evil intentions, wicked thoughts, or errors. They have the good purpose of saving sinners and edifying the saints. However, they do not issue in the building up of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SATAN&rsquo;S SCHEME BEING TO DO A WORK<br />
OF TEARING DOWN IN THE CHURCH SERVICE</h2>
<p>What does it mean for our work to tear down God&rsquo;s building? A good example of this occurs when a brother responsible for a group meeting changes the proposal of the elders to study a particular book of the Bible. While his changing the book may edify those in his meeting, the way he does it tears down God&rsquo;s building up of the church. It does not help the saints to know their flesh, deal with their opinions, or learn to submit to others. His way will only produce people with views and opinions, who like to adjust others and do not submit to others. Although this brother has a good intention and neither criticizes nor judges others, the destruction to the church is serious.</p>
<p>The elders may decide that the whole church should study the Gospel of John, but a responsible brother may think that this book is too long and change it to 1 Thessalonians. This good intention shows that he has not learned the lesson of being broken, he does not know how to put his opinions aside, and he does not know how to submit to others in the church service. The church cannot be built up if twenty-one responsible ones say, &ldquo;The elders are not necessarily right in their way of doing things. Their decisions are not always correct.&rdquo; Once this attitude is adopted, things will get out of control.</p>
<p>These responsible brothers might not be satisfied even if the apostle Paul was one of the elders. Whether the elders make right or wrong decisions is not our problem. Our need is to submit to them. It is difficult to believe that one who does not submit to the elders can produce people who are broken, deny themselves, place themselves under God&rsquo;s hand, and submit to others. The best they can do is produce ones with views and opinions that tear down instead of build up the church.</p>
<p>To build up is to put one stone upon another stone. In contrast, the Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 24 shows the tearing down: &ldquo;There shall by no means be left here a stone upon a stone, which shall not be thrown down&rdquo; (v. 2). In tearing down, no stone is left upon another stone; in building up, every stone is upon another stone. People may praise our work, but we need to see if our work tears down the church. Satan&rsquo;s scheme is to tear down. All our work in Taiwan has been building up; however, during the past six months there has been much tearing down. This is the scheme of the enemy, and many among us have been used by him to do this work of tearing down. We do not want to do this work of tearing down. No brother or sister is doing this work of tearing down out of an evil intention. However, because we have not learned the lessons, we are unconsciously used by Satan in our service to tear down. Satan uses our work to tear down. We may think that we are building up, but our work is tearing down the church. Satan tears down through our work. This causes our service and the testimony of the church to suffer a great loss.</p>
