   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being Delivered unto Death for His Sake</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>That His Life Might Be Manifested in Our Mortal Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 2 Corinthians 4:11 Paul declares, We who are alive are always being delivered unto death for Jesus sake that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The title Jesus in verses 10 and 11 implies that the apostles lived a life like the one the Lord Jesus lived on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord s life was a life under the killing of the cross for the manifestation of the resurrection life, a life lived in such a way that His person was one with His ministry and His life was His ministry John 6:14-15; 12:13, 19, 23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The use of flesh and body interchangeably in 2 Corinthians 4:10-11 indicates that the mortal flesh is our fallen body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order for the life of God to come out of the Lord Jesus, He had to pass through death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He indicated that without death there would be no life John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Without death as the pathway, life cannot be released.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The way of life is the way of death; wherever there is death, there is a way for life to come out.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The expression of the Lord s life in us is contingent upon one thing death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The extent to which death has worked in us is the extent to which the Lord s life has a way to come out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For this reason, even Paul, who was full of experience and was mature in life, pursued to know Christ s death; he wanted to be conformed to His death Phil 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He pursued this death because he knew that the extent to which death worked in him would be the extent to which the Lord s life could be released from him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The death that operates in us and the putting to death of Jesus are the realization and application of the death of Christ in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The more we pass through death, the more life will be expressed from us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, a brother who quarrels with his wife may endeavor to express the Lord and to allow the Lord s life to flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, his natural strength is insufficient to express Christ and to allow His life to flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once he is under the discipline of the Holy Spirit, however, the Spirit will enable him to cooperate with and submit to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then his wife will sense a flavor of Christ coming from him, and she will see to some extent Christ s life in him because the death of the cross has been realized and is being carried out in him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The cross brings in both death and the expression of the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Spirit leads us into the death of the cross hour by hour and day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the leading and work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Holy Spirit in us wants to bring us into death every moment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The stronger the Holy Spirit s work in us is, the stronger our experience of the cross will be.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Without the death of the cross, there is no work of the Holy Spirit; wherever the Holy Spirit works, there is a putting to death by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>From morning until evening and from evening until morning, the Holy Spirit is working in us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He requires that we receive the cross, and He puts us into the death of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The way of life is death, and death is the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we walk on the way of life, we walk on the way of the death of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Christian life is a living of the cross and a living of death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every day we experience death in the Holy Spirit, and we live and walk under death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Death deals with our person.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As we are dealt with and broken, the life of God in us will have a free way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In 2 Corinthians 4:11 Paul does not use the adjective manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Instead, he uses the verb be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is a difference between something that is manifest and something manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The word manifest does not involve experience or a process, but manifested involves a process, a procedure.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In these verses Paul does not say that the life of Jesus may be manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If he had said this, no process or procedure would have been involved.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There would be no need for us to go through anything in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But when Paul speaks of the life of Jesus being manifested in us, that involves a process and requires a procedure.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In verses 10 through 12 we can definitely see the manifestation of life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In verse 11 we may expect Paul to speak of being rescued from death, instead of being delivered unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Paul, however, was always being delivered unto death so that the life of Jesus might be manifested in his mortal flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Paul preferred to be small and to remain in a lowly state.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In fact, the name Paul means little.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The life manifested in Paul was the life of a Nazarene, not the life of a great man in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Moreover, the life of Jesus was manifested in his mortal flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Paul did not consider himself a great person manifesting something marvelous in a splendid body.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Instead, he considered himself a small person manifesting the life of Jesus, a man from Nazareth, in his mortal flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we consider the record of the Lord s life on earth, we see that the emphasis is not on works.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The four Gospels do not stress what the Lord did, what works He accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The record concerning the Lord Jesus in the Gospels is mainly a record of life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the Gospels the emphasis is on life, not on works or activities.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Gospels are biographies presenting a person living in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, the Gospels are not primarily an account of the Lord s marvelous works; they are a description of the life the Lord Jesus lived on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is one reason that Paul in 2 Corinthians 4 uses the name Jesus so often.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The use of this name in chapter 4 brings us back to the Lord as a man whose life was one with His ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord lived in such a way that His person was one with His ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Strictly speaking, the Lord did not accomplish a work.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Instead, He simply lived a certain kind of life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The portrait in the Gospels was painted in such a way as to show forth the Lord s life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Gospels do describe the Lord s works, but much more the Gospels present the life Jesus lived and show us by what way He lived.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There are a number of indications in the Gospels that the Lord Jesus did not care for the accomplishing of a great work.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>One example of the Lord s caring for life and not for a work is found in John 12.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In Jerusalem a great crowd gave a warm welcome to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They took palm branches and went out to meet Him, crying, Hosanna!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel! v. 13 . Even the Pharisees admitted that the world had gone after Him v. 19 . But when Andrew and Philip told the Lord that the Greeks were seeking Him, He answered, The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This indicates clearly that what the Lord Jesus cared for was life, not work.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In the four Gospels there are many illustrations of this.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Whenever people, according to their concept, thought that the opportunity was right for the Lord to accomplish a great work, He never took advantage of that opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Instead, He departed.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He had not come to do a great work.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>His concern was life.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Jesus of Nazareth did not seek to be great or famous.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>On the contrary, He was a grain of wheat that fell into the ground and died.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In this way Jesus became the first Minister of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We need to follow Him to also become ministers of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The Lord, as a grain of wheat that fell into the ground, lost His soul-life through death so that He might release His eternal life to the many grains in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>As the many grains, we also must lose our soul-life through death that we may enjoy eternal life in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Concerning this, we must look to the Lord and pray desperately to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We need to tell the Lord that we are willing to be today s Paul, not a great person or a famous believer, but a small man, a crucified man, even a Nazarene.</S>
