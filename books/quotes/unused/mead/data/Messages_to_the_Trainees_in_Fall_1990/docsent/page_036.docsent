   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT'S LEADING AND WITNESSING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING HIS PRESENCE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Romans 8:14 says, "For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The leading of the Spirit is His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is the presence of the Spirit as His leading that designates us as the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 16 says, "The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Spirit's witnessing is also His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Romans 9:1 says, "In Christ I speak the truth, I lie not, my conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"In the Holy Spirit" again indicates the presence of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>ENJOYING THE DISPENSING OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THROUGH HIS PRESENCE AS THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus became the Spirit in His resurrection, and this Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God, is always with us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We do not need to pray and fast for the Spirit's coming to us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is already here.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Moreover, we are filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is the wonderful Savior, and we have the wonderful Spirit always within us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before the incarnation, God was objective to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, He was incarnated, lived on the earth, died on the cross, resurrected, and became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now all things have been accomplished for the dispensing of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are now in His dispensing, and the basic factor of His dispensing is His presence as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If water did not have a presence in our homes through the water pipes, we could not enjoy the water.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, since the water has been installed in our homes, we can enjoy it at any time by turning on the faucets.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the same way, God's dispensing today is in His presence, and the presence of the Triune God is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Triune God's presence is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many times we fail and make mistakes, but His redeeming blood is His provision for us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Moreover, this provision is found in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is the very consummated Spirit, and He is the totality of the Triune God, compounded with all the divine attributes, human virtues, His redeeming death, and His life-giving resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As such a One He is in us as His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are under His presence, so we must exercise our faith to "turn on the faucet" and enjoy His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must not take the natural way, considering our feelings and seeking to have outward evidence of the divine facts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should reject our feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our feelings mean nothing, and we should not trust them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should rather treasure what the New Testament says.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some among us should compose poems and songs about the items of the New Testament which we have enjoyed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we sing such songs, we will be victorious, holy, spiritual, divine, and heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is to enjoy the fullness of the Spirit within us essentially and upon us economically.</S>
