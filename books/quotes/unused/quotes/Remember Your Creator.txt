All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness
Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth,' and, 'From childhood you have known the sacred writings'
Old people wake up at the slightest noise, even at the sound of a bird, and they have trouble going back to sleep
Grandmothers may be afraid even to climb up to stand on a chair, but little boys often love to climb up on top of the roof
All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness'
You need to love the Lord, you need to read the Bible slowly and carefully, and you need to read the Bible with prayer
In this way, if you do mean business in reading the Word with prayer, you will gain a lot of profit from the Bible
Lord we pray this morning that they would really remember You remember You by loving You that no one among them would remember You too late
We read it with diligent care, We read and we pray, and we pray what we read- In the days of our youth, we would take God's Word in
