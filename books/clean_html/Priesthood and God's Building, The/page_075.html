<h1 class="title">COORDINATION IN THE MEETINGS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE COORDINATION OF PERSONS</h2>
<p>The first aspect of coordination in the meetings is the coordination of persons. For example, after a few brothers pray, it is better for a few sisters to follow. The brothers and the sisters should coordinate together to pray. If only the brothers pray in a meeting and the sisters do not respond, our meetings will be like a paralyzed body, which is neither beautiful nor living. We are not saying that the brothers and sisters should take turns in a set order; we are simply emphasizing that a coordination of persons is needed. In the meetings the brothers and the sisters need to coordinate with one another in a living way. After a few brothers pray, a few sisters should join in, and after a few sisters pray, a few more brothers should join in with more prayers. If the brothers&rsquo; prayers are too quick, the sisters may not be able to keep up. This requires the brothers to be willing to pause and wait so that more sisters can join in to pray. Furthermore, when there is a pause in the middle of a strong atmosphere of prayer, the sisters should realize that the brothers want them to join in. At such a time, the more experienced sisters need to pray immediately. If the experienced sisters do not pray, the young, meek, and timid sisters will be less likely to follow. Then when a sister joins in to fill the time created by the pause, the brothers need to realize that other sisters may follow. Thus, there is no need for the brothers to rush to pray again; they should leave time for more sisters to pray. The brothers also need to learn not to ignore others when they receive an inspiration.</p>
<p>In Genesis 32, when Jacob returned to the land of Canaan, he brought his wives, children, flocks, and herds with him. Later, Jacob met Esau, his brother. In 33:13-14, Jacob said to Esau, &ldquo;My lord knows that the children are frail and that the nursing flocks and herds are a concern to me; and if they overdrive them for one day, all the flock will die. Let my lord please pass on before his servant, and I will lead on slowly according to the pace of the cattle which are before me and according to the pace of the children.&rdquo; His young children and his nursing flocks and herds could not walk too fast, so Jacob accommodated them. Likewise, in the meetings we need to accommodate the sisters. Sometimes, as soon as the sisters begin to pray, the brothers take control of the direction of the prayer. If the sisters have more opportunities to pray, they will be more released.</p>
<p>I hope that the brothers and sisters will begin to pray in coordination in a strong way. Typically, more sisters than brothers attend the meetings, so they should be allowed to function more. This will fill the meeting with enjoyment. The brothers have a responsibility to give the sisters more opportunities to pray, and the sisters have a responsibility to offer prayers at the right time. This coordination will allow the functions of the brothers and the sisters to be carried out in a proper way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">COORDINATION IN THE CONTENT<br />
AND THE LINE OF PRAYER</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Having Content and a Line in Prayer</h2>
<p>In addition to the coordination of persons in the meetings, there is also a need for coordination in the content and the line of the prayer in the meetings. This kind of coordination is even more difficult, so it requires more exercise and practice. For example, there should always be content and a line in the prayer at the bread-breaking meeting. The line of the prayer should climb higher and higher and eventually reach a peak in which there is a blessing of and a thanksgiving for the bread and the cup. When the atmosphere of remembering the Lord reaches the highest peak, the bread and the cup should be passed.</p>
<p>When the meeting reaches such a peak, we need to learn to remain at the peak, just as Moses remained at the top of Mount Pisgah, beholding the land of Canaan (Deut. 34:1). At such a point, we may not need to call a hymn or even utter more praise; we can simply and quietly contemplate the beauty of the Lord. This is not idle time but time at the peak. There is a sense of sweetness in the spirit when everyone reaches the point that there is no need to say anything. In such an atmosphere, we should be silent. If we have learned the lesson, we will not call a hymn or say anything that would disturb others and spoil the atmosphere of silence.</p>
<p>After the bread and the cup have been passed, a brother can pray, thanking the Lord for being our enjoyment. In such a way, the section of remembering the Lord will come to an end, and we can worship the Father. In the bread-breaking meeting, a great portion of time is for remembering the Lord, but there should be some time for the worship of the Father. A brother can start the worship of the Father by praying, and then the saints can follow. Perhaps another brother may be inspired to choose a fitting hymn to worship the Father; in this way, the saints&rsquo; singing will be very enjoyable.</p>
