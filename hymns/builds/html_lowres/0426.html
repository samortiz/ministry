In principle, anything such as philosophy, religion, or cultural traditions that hinders people from apprehending the gospel of Christ is a veil. Hence, the preaching of Christ must unveil them, just as in photography the cover is removed from the lens that it might take in the view.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

Hence, the gospel of Christ is the gospel of His glory that illuminates and shines forth. Satan, the god of this age, has blinded the thoughts and the minds of the unbelievers so that the illumination of the gospel of Christ's glory might not shine into their hearts. This is similar to a camera lens's being covered so that the light cannot shine into the camera to bring in the image. It is also like a blind man, or a man with his eyes veiled, into whom the light of the sun is unable to shine.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

The Slave-Savior's spittle may signify the word that proceeds out of His mouth (see note 6<sup>1</sup> in John 9), a word that conveys the divine light of life to the receiver for the recovery of his sight. Such spitting by the Slave-Savior, accompanied by His laying on of hands, was much richer than His mere touch, which had been requested for the blind man by his helpers.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
