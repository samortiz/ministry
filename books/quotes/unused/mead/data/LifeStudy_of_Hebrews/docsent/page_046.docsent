   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. Heirs of Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The holy brothers are the heirs of salvation 1:14 who inherit so great a salvation 2:3 that does not only make us holy brothers to participate in God s holiness, but also brings us into God s glory.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>D. Brothers of the Firstborn Son of God</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, the holy brothers are the brothers of the Firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is the Firstborn Son of God with both divinity and humanity as we have seen in one of the previous messages.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The holy brothers, as human beings being regenerated with the divine life, are the brothers of Christ with humanity and divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They are the same as Christ in both life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>E. The Church in Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Ultimately, the holy brothers are the church in resurrection 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Individually they are the brothers of Christ; corporately they are the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is absolutely a matter in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before the resurrection of Christ, the church did not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It was through Christ s resurrection that the church came into being, composed of Christ s brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This was why after His resurrection the brothers of Christ, the church, were produced.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today the church in the Lord s recovery must be the church in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>F. Sanctified by and with the Son of God</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Sanctifier is the Son of God and the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As we have seen in message eleven, we have been made qualified to be partakers of the divine holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The divine holiness is simply the holy nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Holiness is God s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As the Sanctifier, Christ is now sanctifying us dispositionally by imparting God s holy nature into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I have often used the illustration of teaification.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A glass of plain water is teaified by putting tea into it until the water is completely teaified.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The way to teaify the water is to add the element of tea to the water until the water is saturated and permeated.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then all of the water will be teaified and will have the appearance, color, taste, and flavor of tea.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is teaification.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are the glass of plain water, and Christ is the very essence of the divine holiness, the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ has put Himself into us, the glass of plain water, to permeate and saturate us until we are fully sanctified with His holy nature.</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are partakers of the divine holiness that is nothing less than the holy nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we are being sanctified, we are saturated into this holy nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is by this saturating way that we partake of the divine holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>H. Pursuing Holiness</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As holy brothers, we have to pursue holiness 12:14 .</S>

   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Now as such sanctified holy ones, we should pursue holiness in our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Without holiness we shall not see the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Without it, our fellowship with the Lord will be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need a holy life in order to keep a continuing fellowship with the Lord that we may see Him all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I. On the Way to Glory</S>

   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As we are on the way to glory, Christ is sanctifying us, ministering to our needs as the High Priest, and bringing us into glory as our Captain.</S>
