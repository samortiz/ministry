THE TEST OF SOME WALKING<br>AMONG THE BELIEVERS DISORDERLY,<br>WORKING AT NOTHING, BUT BEING BUSYBODIES&#151;<br>2 THESSALONIANS 3:11</H2><P>The apostle gave the believers the charge that if anyone does not want to work, neither let him eat (v. 10). The apostle also charged and entreated in the Lord that working with quietness they might eat their own bread (v. 12). The apostle's way in dealing with this case was very practical.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXIII. THE TEST OF CERTAIN ONES<br>TEACHING DIFFERENTLY,<br>OCCUPYING THEMSELVES WITH THINGS<br>OTHER THAN GOD'S ECONOMY, WHICH IS IN FAITH&#151;<br>1 TIMOTHY 1:3-4</H2><P>The apostle urged Timothy to remain in Ephesus in order that he might charge certain ones not to teach differently. The apostle also gave the correcting word according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, with which he was entrusted (vv. 5-11).</P><P>To take care of such a case, we should not merely correct, but should supply the proper teachings to replace the wrong teachings. In taking care of such a problem that concerns God's economy, we need the adequate knowledge of the holy Word, which conveys the full revelation of God's economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XXIV. THE TEST OF SOME DEPARTING<br>FROM THE FAITH, GIVING HEED TO DECEIVING<br>SPIRITS AND TEACHINGS OF DEMONS<br>IN THE HYPOCRISY OF MEN WHO SPEAK LIES&#151;<br>1 TIMOTHY 4:1-2</H2><P>The apostle gave the correcting word (vv. 3-5). The apostle also charged Timothy to lay these things before the brothers so that Timothy would be a good minister of Christ, being nourished with the words of the faith and of the good teaching which he had closely followed (v. 6). To take care of this test, we need to have a great deal of learning, as Paul had.</P>
