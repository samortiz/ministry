   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. MOVING AND LIVING WITH THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 21:1-14 we see the Lord moving and living with the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In resurrection, the Lord was not only meeting with the brothers but also moving and living with them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He is not only with us when we meet; He is even with us in our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Wherever we go, He goes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whatever we do, He is there with us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whether we are right or wrong, the Lord is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A. Moving with the Disciples to the Sea</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 21:1-11, the Lord moved with the disciples to the sea, manifesting Himself again to them at the sea of Tiberias.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Peter, the leading brother, took the lead to backslide into the world, saying, I am going fishing 21:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Six of the other disciples said, We also are coming with you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not only did the six disciples follow Peter, but even the Lord Jesus followed him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord did not say to Peter, Peter, what are you doing?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Are you backsliding from My call?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Are you going back to the sea?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I will never go with you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you go there, you must go on your own.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some may say, If I go to a movie theater, will the Lord Jesus go there with me?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yes, He will go with you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is not only with you in the meeting place but even in a movie theater.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But He will not go with you to the theater to give you peace, but to trouble you, to stir you up, and to tell you to leave that place.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because He would be with you at the movie theater, you could never have a sweet enjoyment while being there.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually you would have to say, I must forget about this movie, for Jesus will not leave me alone.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is life in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In resurrection, the Lord Jesus moved to the sea with the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Appearing Again to Train the Disciples</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>to Realize His Invisible Presence</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 1 says, After these things, Jesus manifested Himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This proves that His coming to the disciples in 20:26 was actually a manifestation, for here it says that He manifested Himself again.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once again, He was training them to practice His invisible presence.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It was not a matter of His coming but of His manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whether they were conscious of His presence or not, He was with them all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But for the sake of their weakness, He sometimes manifested His presence in order to strengthen their faith in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Training the Disciples to Live by Faith in Him</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord manifested Himself to the disciples in chapter twenty-one to train them, especially Peter, to live by faith in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>John 21:2-14 reveals two main things: the weakness of the regenerated people who have been committed with the divine mission of God, and the all-sufficient provision of the Lord who can help us live on this earth for His commission, for His purpose, and for His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Let us first consider the weakness of those who had been regenerated and commissioned by God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>a. Peter and Other Disciples</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Backsliding to Their Old Occupation</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>from the Lord s Call</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At the beginning of this chapter, we see a picture of seven disciples under the leadership of Peter vv.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Along with Peter, there were Thomas, Nathanael, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The number seven represents the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What were the whole Body and their leader doing?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They were backsliding from the Lord s call to their old occupation Matt 4:19-20; Luke 5:3-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Peter said to the other six disciples, I am going fishing v. 3 . His purpose in going fishing was to make a living, to get some food to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All the other disciples said, We also are coming with you v. 3 . Because Peter was the leader, the others went fishing under his leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, the whole Body went fishing, forgetting their divine commission.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord had instructed them to tarry at Jerusalem, for they had been commissioned Luke 24:49 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord had told them to wait in Jerusalem for the day when they would all be clothed with heavenly power from on high.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But this picture in chapter twenty-one reveals that the disciples had left that position, giving up that ground.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>By leaving Jerusalem and coming to Galilee, they gave up their position.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They had decided to go to the sea to fish.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Peter and the other disciples went fishing because of their living.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They might have lacked a sufficient supply of food and were very concerned about it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Peter might have said, We only have food for one meal.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I don t know where the next meal is coming from.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I m going fishing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Not only did the six disciples go fishing with Peter; the Lord Jesus went also.</S>
