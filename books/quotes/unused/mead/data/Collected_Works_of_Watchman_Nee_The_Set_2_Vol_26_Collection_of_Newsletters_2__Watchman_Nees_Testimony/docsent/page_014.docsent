   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RECENT NEWS FROM BROTHER HAN FU SHENG</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brother Nee:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The edification which the children of God received at the last Overcomers' Conference seems to be more than they received in the two previous conferences.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Glory, praise, and thanks be to the God of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Not long after I returned from the conference, my eldest child died of tuberculosis.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although at first it broke my heart, thank the Lord; He breaks and then bandages, wounds and then heals, with His hands.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Through this fiery trial, the truths I had newly received have become my experience.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When I was in Shanghai, I told you a little about the way I had been going for the past few years.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But now the Lord's light has given me great enlightenment.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Woe to me if I continue to disobey!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At first I did not want to tell you what I had passed through.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, I can be silent no longer, because I need those who are in one accord with me to pray for me and instruct me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I had a little knowledge about the denominations for quite some time, but because there are still a few faithful lovers of the Lord in the denominations, I really could not bear to separate from them actually, it was not being separated from the brothers but from the denominations !</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I was also slow to obey because I saw some who had left the denominations become a "I am of Christ" sect.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They look on the brothers in the denominations like the Jews look at the Samaritans.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If this is the case, the more they leave the denominations, the more denominations there will be.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, I thought it would be better to "change the denominations" than to "leave the denominations."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What is more, I could avoid many sufferings of the cross!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Last year I agreed to accept a job with the Chen Chiang Baptist Church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I was a preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I did not agree to being a pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This year Mr. Ma of the mission board returned to his own country.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He wanted to hand over the control of the church to me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>So I did my best to explain my idea of reforming the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After many debates, I finally saw the characteristics of the denominations and knew them clearly to the core.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At this point, I woke up and realized that I could only leave the denominations; they will never be dissolved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The command in the Bible is to "come out."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>My idea to reform the denominations was really absurd!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I boldly and decisively announced that I was leaving the denominations during the last week of May.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the first week of June, I had the first table meeting in my home.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sister Liu and Sister Liang came from the Chi Lu Medical School in Tsinan.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They are now working as nurses in the Christian hospital here.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They have much light of the truth, and they encouraged me very much!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Step by step the Lord Himself led us to have a meeting in the Lord's name in Chen Chiang.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We few were held fast by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The news of our table meeting spread through all the denominations that very same day.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They were so afraid of such a little matter that they created a storm in the whole city.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I heard that they had emergency meetings on both Monday and Tuesday.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Their first step was to forbid the two sisters working in the hospital to come to our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If they did not receive the exhortations, the sisters would lose their jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Their second step was a plan to "deflect the tiger from the mountain."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They tried to tempt me to leave Chen Chiang.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I told the representatives they sent that I was not interested in any profit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If the Lord ordered me to stay here, I would not leave even if I would die!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As of this minute, storms attacking us have not stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have had the table meeting six times.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Every one likes to linger around the Lord's table.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There are four or five sisters and two or three brothers in every meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Unfortunately, the brothers are still milk-drinkers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They cannot bear any responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I am extremely lonely now.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We hope the Lord will give us a place to preach the gospel soon.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is not very convenient to have the table meeting on a mountain either.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We would like to know whether or not our gospel hall could have a name like Gospel Chapel, Jesus Chapel, Testimony Chapel, or Preaching Hall.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It seems that it is very difficult to attract outsiders to come hear a message in a place without a name.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>How should we baptize a seventy-year-old person who cannot go all the way into the water?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some people kneel in the water to be baptized; then the baptizer pushes them forward and immediately helps them up.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Is this the proper way?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>May you be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Your brother in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Han Fu Sheng</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>June 12, under the lamp</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>P.S. How has your health been? I think of you often.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Note from Watchman: The Lord has really worked in every place to bring many of His faithful children into the way of obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We thank Him!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We really praise the Lord for our Brother Han.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>With regard to whether or not their meeting is "standing on the ground of the church" or whether they know what the Body life is or whether they are expressing this life in a locality, I do not think we should make any hasty judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We should thank God for them.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I think that in the future, it would be best if some of us went to visit people like Brother Han that are raised up in a certain place.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Perhaps we can write letters to help them see that leaving the denominations is only negative and is not worth anything; they must also express the Body life on the positive side and stand on the ground of a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Perhaps they will misunderstand our reasons for pursuing this.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But if they do not receive this vision, we cannot go to fellowship with them, nor can we recognize their table as the table that God has established in the locality.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>However, when they understand these matters, they will see that we are right.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is God's requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>May those who leave the denominations not think that they can be loose because everyone else is lawless.</S>
