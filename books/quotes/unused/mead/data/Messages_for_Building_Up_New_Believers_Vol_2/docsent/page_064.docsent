   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY MARRIAGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to be a good Christian, one needs to deal with all the basic issues in a thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If there is one basic issue that is not settled, whether it be the family or one s occupation, problems will eventually come back.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As long as there is one unresolved issue, a Christian will not be able to take a straight path before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today we will cover the subject of marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A new believer should know what God s Word has to say about marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to consider this subject from various angles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I. MARRIAGE BEING HOLY</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first question to address with regard to marriage is the matter of sex.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to be clear that human beings have an awareness of sex in the same way that they have an awareness of hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Just as the consciousness of hunger is a natural demand of the body, the consciousness of sex is also a natural demand of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To feel hungry is natural; it is not a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But to steal food is sin; that is not natural.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Likewise, having a consciousness of sex is natural and is not a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But if a person uses improper means to satisfy his demand, he falls into sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Marriage was ordained and initiated by God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, the consciousness of sex also was given by God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Marriage is not something that was instituted after man s fall; it was there before man sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It was not instituted after Genesis 3; rather, God ordained marriage in Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, the consciousness of sex existed before, not after, sin entered the world.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is definitely not a sin for a person to have the consciousness of sex.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is no element of sin in this consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather, it is a consciousness created by God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>New believers must be clear concerning this point.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I have contacted many young brothers and sisters in the course of my Christian life and service during the past thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many of them were troubled by the matter of marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They were unnecessarily condemned in their conscience because they were ignorant of God s ordination as well as God s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They had the consciousness and need of marriage, yet they thought that this was sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some brothers have fallen into serious doubts about God s work only because of their consciousness of sex.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is a heathen thought to treat sex as something sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to be clear about God s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Just as it is not sin for a man to feel hungry, the need for sex is not sinful; it is a natural consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hebrews 13:4 tells us, Let marriage be held in honor among all.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Marriage is not only honorable but even holy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God considers sex not only natural but even holy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Dr. Meyer, a co-worker of D. L. Moody, wrote many good books on edification.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He once said, Only the most filthy mind would consider sex as something filthy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I think this was well said.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Man injects filthy thoughts into sex because he himself is filthy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To the clean everything is clean.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To the defiled everything is defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because man s mind is defiled, his thoughts also become defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to realize that marriage is clean.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A God-ordained sex relationship is holy, clean, and undefiled.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In 1 Timothy 4:1-3 Paul said that in later times, there would be the teachings of demons, one of which is the forbidding of marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Here we see that even demonic teachings pursue holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>G. H. Pember pointed out clearly in his writing how men would forbid marriage in the pursuit of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They thought that this would make them holy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, in his Epistle to Timothy, Paul told us that forbidding marriage is a doctrine of the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God has never forbidden marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>No one should be condemned unnecessarily in his conscience because of heathen religious teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The consciousness of sex is something natural and is not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is only when one begins to deal with this consciousness that the possibility of it becoming a sin arises.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is not a question of the presence of this consciousness; the presence of this consciousness is natural and is not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is the way a person deals with this consciousness that determines whether or not it is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This matter needs to be thoroughly cleared up.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Otherwise a person s conscience will be condemned, and he will not grow.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This feeling of guilt is, in fact, not sin at all but the result of ignorance.</S>
