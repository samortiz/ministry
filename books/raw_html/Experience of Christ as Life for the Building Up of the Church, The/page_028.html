<P>Some Christians are even worse than soulish. Paul said that the Corinthian believers were fleshly and even fleshy (3:3, 1). This means that they were totally of the flesh. First Corinthians 5 and 6 describe what it is to be fleshy. There are the immoral things such as fornication and adultery in chapter five and contentions, envying, and strife leading to lawsuits among the believers in chapter six.</P><P>Paul, of course, was neither fleshy nor soulish. He was a spiritual man. Paul demonstrated the Spirit by exercising his spirit (2:4). His spirit was so strong that he attended the Corinthians' meeting in his spirit even though he could not be there physically. With fleshly and soulish people, there is no possibility of having the church life. Only spiritual people can have the church life.</P><P>Today there is a wrong concept among seeking Christians. The fundamental Christians think that the church can be built up by teachings. The Pentecostal Christians think that the church can be built up by the gifts. But history has shown that doctrines and gifts have divided the Lord's children. The only way that the church can be built up is for us to be spiritual Christians, Christians who live according to our spirit mingled with the Spirit of God.</P><P>We should care only for the enjoyment of the Lord. Then we will be of one mind, of one opinion, and we will speak the same thing. When we turn to our spirit, we are the same. As we live in the spirit, the church as the farm of God will grow Christ. Christ has been sown into us, and now He needs to grow out of us. What we need today is to turn ourselves to the spirit. Then we will grow Christ and be transformed. If we remain in the spirit, regardless of our environment or circumstances, we will be taken over by the Spirit and become different persons. Then there will be the real possibility for us to have the church life. The only possibility for us to be built up into the temple of God is for us to be in the spirit. We are one in the spirit because in our spirit there is nothing except Christ, and Christ is everything. When we have Christ, we have love and patience. When we have Christ, we have everything.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PRACTICALITY OF THE CHURCH LIFE<br>BEING WITH OUR BODY</H2><P>If we are in the spirit, we will use our physical body in a proper way. We need to let the Spirit take over our whole being; then we will know how to use our body. The possibility for the church life is in our spirit, but the practicality of the church life is with our body. In 1 Corinthians 2 and 3 Paul deals with the spirit, the soul, and the flesh, and in chapter six he deals with our physical body. If we are going to have a proper church life, we have to use our body in the right way.</P><P>If you are careless in the way that you dress, you are misusing your body. Your body is for Christ, and Christ is for your body (v. 13). People in the world like to stay up late, making the day the night and the night the day. If we are like this, it will be difficult for us to have a time with the Lord in the morning. In this matter, we misuse our body. We have to be in the spirit to control our body and use it in the proper way.</P><P>Chapter six covers the sins of fornication and of eating in excess (v. 13). If we eat at restaurants often, we are misusing our body because that is not healthy for us. We have to be delivered from many old habits by which we misuse our body. Everything concerning the way we eat, dress, and live for our physical existence has to be proper. Our body should be absolutely for the Lord and for nothing else.</P><P>We need to learn the lesson of having our spirit strengthened by the Lord, our soul saturated with the Lord, and our body controlled by the Lord. Then there will be the possibility and the practicality for us to have the church life. Then the church can be built up as the temple of God, and we can glorify God in our body in a corporate way (v. 20). We will be the living members of the Body of Christ in our bodies with our spirit strengthened and all the parts of our soul saturated with the Spirit.</P>
