   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A HISTORY OF CHANGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The history of the Lord's recovery has not been that long among us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have passed through about three quarters of a century.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our brother who was before us, Brother Watchman Nee, was saved in 1920.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Two years later, the Lord used him to raise up meetings in his hometown of Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This could be considered as the beginning of the Lord's recovery among us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From that time until now, it has been sixty-eight years.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Humanly speaking, it is a long period of time, long enough for a man to pass through most of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>During the first period of the Lord's recovery, that is, the first eight or ten years, we received help mostly from outsiders.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Between 1930 and 1934, Brother Nee himself began to receive revelation from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 1931 Brother Nee consented to the request of some brothers from the Closed Brethren for a visit to us in China.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Closed Brethren were stronger than the Open Brethren in matters of truth and life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Their visit created some problems.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Based on this, Brother Nee was willing to go to them and had some fellowship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 1933 he went to Europe, and from there he crossed the ocean and went to Canada.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Brethren movement was strong in those two places.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Through this visit, Brother Nee gained more knowledge and was also somewhat affected.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After he came back, he reconsidered the way that the Lord wants the church to take on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He received God's revelation and saw something new concerning the truth of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As a result, in 1934 he published a book based on a Bible study he conducted with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The name of it was The Meeting Life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 1937 he called an urgent co-workers' meeting, which was held first in Shanghai and then in Hangkow, in which he released a series of messages.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These messages became the content of the book The Normal Christian Church Life, with which we are all familiar.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After this, there was a storm among us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The problem involved was a very deep-rooted one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For six years Brother Nee was not able to fulfill his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It was not until 1948 that his ministry was recovered and that he was able to serve the churches again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He then went on further with what he saw.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As a result, he began a training at Kuling near his hometown.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One term of this training was conducted during the second half of 1948.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It lasted for four months.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In 1949 there was a second term, which lasted for about four months also.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After this the Communists took over the mainland.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some of us left the mainland and came to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I was one of these.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Brother Nee stayed behind on the mainland with the other brothers and sisters for the Lord's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Soon afterwards, the situation changed drastically.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Brother Nee was put into prison, and he and his speaking were locked up for twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>During this period we were unable to communicate with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, we had no way to find out what more he had seen before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After we were led out of the mainland, we began to propagate the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First we began in Taiwan, then in Southeast Asia, and lastly in the West.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>During the past forty years, the Lord has been taking us on all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All that the Lord has shown us has been released as messages, and most of it has been printed in books.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, there is one unfortunate thing among us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>During the past twenty or more years, time and again turmoils have occurred.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>About once every few years there has been a storm.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some of you can remember that from 1949 to 1957 our number jumped from three or five hundred to forty or fifty thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But the visit of Brother Sparks brought in the dissension of a few brothers, and a storm was formed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The storm began taking shape in 1959.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Within a period of six years, the whole situation became quite damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Prior to this I had gone to America to work overseas.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I did not come back until 1965 to deal with the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>That was the first storm.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After this, the Lord propagated His work in the United States through us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>By 1978 there was another storm.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>That storm was not as complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In less than a year, it was over.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>During the past few years, there has been a third storm.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This storm began developing and fermenting from 1985.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>By 1987 it had become a definite turmoil.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Now after over two years, the storm is almost over.</S>
