   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DRINKING, EATING, AND BREATHING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we consider these various items covered in John, we realize how vital they are for our existence.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Without drinking, eating, and breathing we could not live.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These three means for our physical existence are all used by the Lord Jesus to illustrate how we may take Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is our water, more refreshing than the best earthly drink.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must drink Him!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is our bread.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must eat Him!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Bread is not merely to be looked at.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Its purpose is to be eaten.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ as the living bread must be eaten.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do not think that to say this is uncultured and wild.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He says Himself that we must eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is our breath, imparting Himself as life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must breathe Him!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This enjoyment of Jesus is God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is this that He would recover among His people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Jesus is the living water, the living bread, and the living breath.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must drink of Him, eat Him, and breathe Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE WAY TO TAKE CHRIST IN</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are two ways by which we may drink, eat, and breathe Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These are the Word and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"It is the Spirit who gives life; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life" John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This verse mentions both the Word and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The very Word revealed in John 1:1 eventually became the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is this Spirit who is the water, the bread, and the breath.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>John 20:22 reads, "Receive the Holy pneuma."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This Greek word pneuma may be translated either as "spirit" or as "breath."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is equally correct to say, "Receive the Holy Spirit" or "Receive the holy breath."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Spirit today is our breath.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This breath is Jesus, the incarnate Word who went to the cross, entered into resurrection, and ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He then returned to us as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have the Word outside us and the Spirit inside us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Day by day we must come to the Word, not only with our mind but also with our heart and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As we open the Bible, we must open our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must read not only with our understanding but also with prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Bible is not an ordinary book.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this holy Word there is life, the Spirit, God, and Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These are all contained in the Word and are conveyed to us as we open ourselves and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This prayerful reading of the Word is the eating, drinking, and breathing in of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How would you answer if someone asked you where God is?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do not say that God is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Heaven is too far away.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How could one get there to find Him?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God, you must tell him, is in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Where is Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He too is in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Where is the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Where is life?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The answer to these questions is also "in the Word."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>SPENDING TIME IN THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Spend time with this book.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Besides your ten minutes in the morning, take a few more minutes at noon, and a few more in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As you open this book, open yourself also.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Read, understand, and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As you pray, you are drinking the water, eating the food, and breathing the air.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The more you take Christ into you in this way, the more Christ you will have growing in you.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You will become another person.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do not expect quick results; growth takes time.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It does not come about from a few concentrated days of praying and fasting and then having something fall upon you from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Take time to water the little seed of life sown into the soil of your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Not only will you grow; the church will also grow and be built up in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the church meetings Christ will come forth in the teaching, the preaching, and the testifying.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Such riches in the church life will convince and attract new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>REGULAR GROWTH</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Do not be concerned about how much you understand of what you read.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What matters is that you faithfully open the Word, open yourself, and read and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is not a once-for-all procedure.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is not like being born, but like breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Growth, like breathing, is continual, day by day and even minute by minute.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You will grow by coming regularly to the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Carry a pocket version of the Word with you.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Wherever you are, when you have a few minutes, open it and read a chapter or so, then pray over what you have read.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>There is little need for you to pray over your grades at school, or for your business to be successful, or for guidance when you go shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Simply pray the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In this way you will receive and enjoy God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>PRAYING THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>What do you think makes you healthy and strong?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is by eating, drinking, and breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When it gets close to meal time you probably feel weak; you need to eat to regain your energy.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The same is true spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>You are weak if you have not been eating, drinking, and breathing Christ in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In fact, it is a mercy that you are still here.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Do not try to run the race without food, drink, and air any longer!</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Come to the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Open to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Speak to Him the words you read.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>For example, you may pray the words of John 1:14 and 16: "The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Lord, thank You, You are the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>You became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Thank You that You tabernacled among us.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Among us!</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Full of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Hallelujah, grace!</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Amen, grace and reality!</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Of His fullness we have all received.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We have all received.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We have received, Lord, and we are receiving even now.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Praise the Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Does praying the Word in this way seem like foolishness to you?</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>I tell you, it is the way to eat, drink, and breathe Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This is how we can live Christ, rather than living morality or ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Read and pray the Word!</S>
