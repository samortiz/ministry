   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BECOMING NURSING MOTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND EXHORTING FATHERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we pointed out in the previous chapter, the church service is not mainly for doing things but for taking care of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our present training is not to build up our skill to be a leader, to usher, or to arrange chairs.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I have no intention to carry out this kind of training.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Chair arranging is not for chair arranging itself, and ushering is not for ushering itself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we do a good job merely in the practical matters but do not take care of anyone, we are a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the way of a worldly corporation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whatever we do in the church life is for the care of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is easy to do practical things, but to take care of persons is much more difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If a sister asks us to clean her house, we may do it in half a day, but if she asks us to take care of her children, we would certainly refuse, because to do that is not in our blood.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before a young sister is married, it may be very difficult to regulate her.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After she is married and has children, however, there is no need to regulate her.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Her children become very skillful regulators, and she is willing to be regulated.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Previously she may have refused to do dirty jobs, but now she will happily do the dirtiest job.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is because she now has a mother s blood.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>She does it because she loves her children.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First Thessalonians 2:7 says, We were gentle in your midst, as a nursing mother would cherish her own children.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To cherish is not merely to do a job or to carry out a business; it is to care for a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 11 says, Just as you know how we were to each one of you, as a father to his own children, exhorting you and consoling you and testifying.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul nourished the Thessalonians as a mother and exhorted them as a father.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The apostle was not a businessman or a school master.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was a nourishing mother and an exhorting father.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He had an interest in people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we do not have an interest in people, we are finished with the church service; we are not qualified to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should not say that only the apostle Paul could be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What the apostle did is an example for all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are not apostles, but we should still be nursing mothers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even the brothers must nourish others as a mother, and the sisters should exhort others as a father.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This does not depend on our being male or a female; it depends on the kind of heart we have.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A sister can have the heart of a father, and a brother can have the heart of a mother.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This passage shows what the apostle Paul was in the Lord s service.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He did not consider himself to be a great man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He considered himself as a small nursing mother and an exhorting, consoling father.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His heart was the heart of a mother and of a father 2 Cor 12:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The heart of a mother is altogether for the care of her children, and the heart of a father is for their upbringing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even if a mother keeps her house clean and in order, she will condemn herself if she neglects her children.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To care for her children is of the first importance; to clean the house is the last.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the church service we should all have such a heart.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Strictly speaking, we do not care for keeping the chairs.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We care for keeping the persons.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The keeping of chairs will not enter into the New Jerusalem, but the keeping of persons will go on forever.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I am afraid that too many of us in the church service care only for the practical service, not for the persons.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need the Lord s mercy to properly exercise our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is a great test to us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some of us were born in such a way that we do not care for anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is according to our natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hallelujah, we have been reborn in another way!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have been reborn, not into a natural family but into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is another birth with another disposition that is absolutely different.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The disposition of our new birth is one that sacrifices our self, our soul, and even our lives for the care of others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>THE TESTIMONY OF THE MISSIONARIES IN CHINA</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the latter part of the nineteenth and the first part of the twentieth centuries a number of missions sent missionaries into the field.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Most of the missions tested their new applicants, but not in the way of testing only their knowledge of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hudson Taylor was the founder of the China Inland Mission, one of the greatest mission works.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>One day he made an appointment for a young applicant to come for an interview.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When the applicant arrived, Taylor asked him to wait for another twenty minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then at the end of the twenty minutes, he sent word to the applicant to wait for another twenty minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At this point, the young applicant was a little offended, but since he still desired to get into this mission, he exercised his patience.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A third time and a fourth time, Taylor asked the young man to wait for yet another twenty minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After the fourth delay, the young man was unable to tolerate it, and he walked out.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Taylor said that it was right for him to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If he would go to China, he would have to wait many times longer for one person to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Missions such as these were the Lord s work at that time to send His gospel to the uttermost parts of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When I was a small boy, I observed the situation of the missionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Those dear saints who went on the mission were very much disciplined by the Lord to have a heart for the heathen peoples, and it was through them not through their preaching or teaching but through what they were that many were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is difficult to imagine what manner of patience, endurance, and attitude they expressed to those unbelieving heathen.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This touched the conscience of the people, and it opened the door of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The ancient and great country of China was extremely conservative at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Boxer Movement of 1900 intended to kill the Westerners in China and all the Chinese Christians who followed the Western religion.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>However, the people respected a certain older Presbyterian missionary named Mr. Corbett.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Mr. Corbett could not speak eloquently, but he had a heart to love the people.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He loved everyone, and he gave whatever he had to them.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Eventually, everyone came to know that this was an American who was for everyone but himself.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Therefore, even the Boxers proclaimed a slogan: Kill all the Westerners and their followers, except Mr. Corbett.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The American Presbyterian mission came to my province in China around the middle of the 1800s.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The leaders of the villages gave the order that whoever saw a foreigner approaching should sound a gong for warning.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>All the streets would clear, the doors would close, and no one would come out.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Because of this, one American missionary would hide next to a door.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>After several hours when the people inside would open the door to look outside, he would place a stick in the door, and then he would insert his foot.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Although the people inside resisted, he was eventually able to enter.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>According to ancient Chinese custom, every home had a corner for grinding grain.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>People would mostly use mules to do the grinding, but if mules were not available, they would have to use manpower.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When the missionary entered into the yard, the family would come to beat him and chase him out.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>However, he would find the grinding stone and begin to grind the grain for them.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This changed the atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The family would go away to do other things, leaving the foreign devil to do the grinding.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>After several hours the mother would send one of the boys to take him a cup of water.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It was in this way that the heart of that family was touched and the door of the gospel was opened to them.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>What a burden this missionary bore, and what an interest he had in people!</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Those who were saved through this kind of endurance were never able to forget it, and they took the same way to preach to others.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This was the way that opened the doors in China.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>From this account we can see what touches people s heart and what kind of burden we need to bear.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Today we are not in the ancient, exclusive, conservative China.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We are in America, a modern country.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>However, this modern country has its modern demons to keep people away from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>To be sure, we need to pray for people, but there is also the need for genuine care for their souls.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If we have the heart to care, we will have a way.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Love can do everything; there is nothing impossible with love 1 Cor 13:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If we have an intensified burden and care for people, there will be a way to express this care.</S>
