[1]  Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures, Vol. 2 CONTENTS
[2]  In order for the children of God, especially new believers, to receive a greater supply of the Word, we, by the Lord s grace, wish to present some crucial truths in the Holy Scriptures so that the children of God may receive a foundation in the Word of God.
[3]  In the first sixteen topics, we saw the aspects of God s salvation.
[4]  Now we will study matters that one must practice after being saved.
[5]  God s interaction with man and the service He requires of man can be divided into the age of the Old Testament and the age of the New Testament.
[6]  Many today think and preach that baptism is not related to salvation.
[7]  Our Lord said that in order to be regenerated into the kingdom of God, one must be born not only of the Spirit but also of water.
[8]  If a person wants to enter into the kingdom of God, he must repent and believe to receive the Lord s life through the Holy Spirit, and he must also be baptized to terminate everything of himself through the water of baptism.
[9]  Therefore, if, before others, we want to be washed of our sins of rebelling against God and opposing the Lord, and if we want our sins to be forgiven and to receive the Holy Spirit, we must not only repent and believe on the Lord s name, but we must also be baptized.
[10]  Thus, just as we believe into Christ, so also we are baptized into Christ; both cause us to enter into Christ and to be joined to Him.
[11]  Just as we are joined to Christ through believing to partake of Him, so we are joined to Him through baptism to partake of Him.
[12]  They were saved through the ark from God s judgment, and they were saved in the ark by means of the flood waters from the old world; in the same way, we are saved through Christ from God s judgment, and we are saved in Christ by means of the water of baptism from the world to which we originally belonged.
[13]  This tells us that even after receiving by faith the redemption of the Lord s shed blood and even with the removal of God s wrath, we must still cross the water of baptism so that Satan s power over us can be destroyed.
[14]  When the Lord was on earth gaining disciples, He did not baptize; rather, His disciples baptized.
[15]  The laying on of hands is something people should receive after believing and being baptized.
[16]  "The word of the beginning of Christ...a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith in God, of the teaching of baptisms and of the laying on of hands, of the resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment" Heb 6:1-2 .
[17]  He the Holy Spirit had not yet fallen upon any of them, but they had only been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.
[18]  The second kind of laying on of hands is for receiving the Holy Spirit.
[19]  The fifth kind of laying on of hands is the laying on of hands to send some out for the work, so it is the laying on of hands for sending out.
[20]  The laying on of hands for appointment causes the recipients to receive a service within a church; the laying on of hands for sending out causes the recipient to go out into the work.
[21]  The topic of head covering is ignored by many, but others pay much attention to it.
[22]  Therefore, we must spend some time to see what God s Word says about this topic.
[23]  THE BASIS FOR HEAD COVERING Based on the Fact That God Is the Head
[24]  He expresses God s authority and glory in God s headship over Him, and we must express Christ s authority and glory in His headship over us.
[25]  A man ought not to have his head covered, since he is God s image and glory; but the woman is the glory of the man 1 Cor 11:7 .
[26]  Regardless of whether we are male or female, we are all out from God.
[27]  We must allow God to thoroughly clean out Satan s rebellious thoughts and life from within us so that our thoughts and ideas would be completely recovered from his deceit and usurpation and so that we would inwardly submit to God s authority without the slightest dissension through our confession that God is the head.
[28]  Judge this in your own selves: Is it fitting for a woman to pray uncovered to God?
[29]  Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him, but if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, because her long hair has been given to her for a covering 1 Cor 11:13-15 .
[30]  THE OBJECT WHICH COVERS THE HEAD Long Hair Not Replacing an Object
[31]  To break bread is to eat the Lord s supper.
[32]  Since this is a great matter in the New Testament, which expresses our relationship with the Lord Jesus and our relationship with the saints, we cannot neglect it.
[33]  He took a cup and gave thanks, and He gave it to them, saying, Drink of it, all of you, for this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for forgiveness of sins ; This cup is the new covenant established in My blood Matt 26:27-28; 1 Cor 11:25 .
[34]  When the Lord established the breaking of bread, He not only broke bread, gave it to the disciples, and told them to take and eat, He also took a cup, gave it to them, and told them to take and drink.
[35]  Although the main goal of the Lord s death on the cross was to release, to dispense, His divine life to us, He not only released His life, but He also redeemed us from all our sins.
[36]  God s eternal purpose is to dispense His life to us, but because of the fall we also are sinners before God.
[37]  When the Lord Jesus was crucified, He drank the cup of wrath on our behalf John 18:11 and received God s righteous judgment for us, tasting all the sufferings of perdition, shedding His blood, redeeming us from our sins, and establishing a new covenant for us in which we are given the cup of salvation as our cup of blessing Psa 116:13; 23:5 .
[38]  His shed blood redeemed us from our sins and averted God s wrath; through His blood we have the forgiveness of offenses, and we have been bought by Him so that we can obtain God and all that He is and has.
[39]  Rather, we say that we are drinking the cup of the Lord because His blood established the new covenant for us and became a cup as our appointed portion v. 27 . This portion causes us to be forgiven of our sins and to obtain God and all that He is and has.
[40]  THE CENTER OF THE BREAD-BREAKING MEETING Remembering the Lord
[41]  The Lord Jesus...took bread...broke it and said... this do unto the remembrance of Me 1 Cor 11:23-24 .
[42]  When we come together to break bread, it is not for the purpose of praying to receive grace or to hear a message to be edified; rather, it is to remember the Lord.
[43]  Therefore, in the bread-breaking meeting all the hymns, the prayers of thanksgiving and praise, the reading of Scripture, or the spiritual speaking should center on the Lord and declare the Lord s person, work, grace, virtues, life and suffering on earth, or honor and glory in the heavens in order that all would remember the Lord Himself.
[44]  In this meeting we should focus on the Lord and behold Him so that we are filled with spiritual feelings about Him, which we can outwardly express in hymns, prayers, Scripture readings, or prophesying, in order to keep the entire attention of the meeting on the Lord Himself and to enable everyone to sense the Lord or some aspect concerning Him in remembrance of Him.
[45]  In the bread-breaking meeting, when we see or receive the bread, we should consider how the Lord was incarnated for us, how He died for us in the flesh, and how His body was broken for us and dispensed to us, giving us His life.
[46]  Before the bread, we should think only of the Lord and all that His love has accomplished for us; we should not think of ourselves or anything concerning ourselves, because we are in a meeting to remember the Lord.
[47]  In the bread-breaking meeting we should not only think of the Lord and all that He has done for us when we look at the bread and receive it, we should also remember Him when we look at the cup and receive it.
[48]  When we see the cup and receive it to drink, we should consider how the Lord partook of flesh and blood for us Heb 2:14 , how He gave up His body for us to obtain His life, and how He shed His blood for us so that we could obtain the highest blessing of being freed from sin and gaining God and all that He is and has.
[49]  From the meaning of this symbol, we should consider how the Lord was pressed by God, how He bore our sins and became sin for us, how He was judged in our place, became a curse, and shed His blood to become our cup of blessing as our portion.
[50]  When we eat the Lord s body and drink the Lord s blood, we are not only receiving but also enjoying Him and all that He accomplished by giving His body and shedding His blood for us.
[51]  Whenever we break bread to remember the Lord, we should not just quietly think about the Lord s person and work; we should offer up praises and thanksgiving, opening our spirits to receive the Lord and all that He is and has as our inward enjoyment.
[52]  As often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you declare the Lord s death until He comes 1 Cor 11:26 .
[53]  The cup placed beside the bread indicates that the Lord s blood is outside of His body because it flowed out of His body and has been separated from His body.
[54]  Therefore, when we break bread and place the cup beside the bread, it displays the Lord s death by spreading out His death before the universe for God, the angels, Satan, the demons, and all creation, including us, to see.
[55]  As we display the Lord s death, we also display everything that the Lord accomplished through His death to God, to the created things in the universe, and to ourselves.
[56]  Our remembrance is to remember the Lord Himself, to enjoy Him; our declaration is to declare the Lord s death, to display His death; and our expectation is to expect the Lord s return, to wait for His return.
[57]  THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE BREAKING OF BREAD Fellowship with the Lord
[58]  Jesus took bread and blessed it, and He broke it and gave it to the disciples and said, Take, eat ; This is My body which is being given for you ; And He took a cup and gave thanks, and He gave it to them, saying, Drink of it, all of you, for this is My blood ; Which is being poured out for you Matt 26:26; Luke 22:19; Matt 26:27-28; Luke 22:20 .
[59]  He gives the bread and the cup to us; that is, He gives us His body and His blood, which means He gives Himself to us in fellowship.
[60]  We receive the bread and the cup from Him; that is, we receive His body and His blood, which means we receive Him personally and thus have fellowship with Him.
[61]  He gives His body and His blood to us in fellowship, and through His body given for us and His blood poured out for us, He gives Himself to us in fellowship for our enjoyment.
[62]  The Lord Jesus was incarnated to put on our nature and to become the same as we; He gave up His body for us so that we could have His life and become the same as He is.
[63]  Even though He is God, He has the human life and nature; even though we are men, we have God s divine life and nature.
[64]  Despite the fact that we were originally full of sin and could not contact Him as the sinless One, He shed His blood and fully redeemed us from our sins, causing us to become as sinless as He is; thus, we can contact Him and have fellowship with Him.
[65]  This verse speaks not only of our fellowship with the Lord through His blood and body but even more of our fellowship in the Lord s blood and body with all the saints.
[66]  THE TESTIMONY OF THE BREAKING OF BREAD The Testimony That We Are Joined to the Lord
[67]  Jesus took bread and...gave it to the disciples and said, Take, eat; this is My body.
[68]  This speaks of our being joined to the Lord, and it testifies that we are joined to the Lord.
[69]  When we eat the bread and drink the cup, we take them into us, signifying that, through the Lord s giving up of His body and the pouring out of His blood, He came into us and joined Himself to us.
[70]  When we receive the Lord s body given for us and His blood poured out for us, we also testify that we have partaken of both Him and His accomplishments for us and thus are joined with Him.
[71]  Every time we break bread, we testify that we and He, He and we, have been joined as one because of the redemption accomplished through the Lord s giving up of His body and the shedding of His blood.
[72]  As we break the bread, we testify that we have obtained His life and are joined to Him in life because of what He accomplished by giving up His body and being broken for us.
[73]  When we break bread, not only do we testify that we are joined to the Lord, but we also testify that we are joined to all the saints and are in oneness with all the saints; that is, we are in the oneness of the church.
[74]  The breaking of bread as it relates to the Lord s supper refers to the Lord s own body His body of flesh and signifies that the Lord s own body was broken for us; the breaking of bread as it relates to Lord s table refers to the Lord s mystical Body the church and signifies that the Lord s mystical Body is one.
[75]  The bread that we broke last year, the bread broken this year, the bread broken last Lord s Day, the bread broken this Lord s Day, the bread broken in Taipei, the bread broken in Kaohsiung, the bread broken in Hall 1, and the bread broken in Hall 5 are all the one bread which symbolizes the one Body.
[76]  With the degradation of the church, the matter of bread breaking became confused; therefore, the Holy Spirit in the Bible teaches us to have discernment concerning the breaking of bread.
[77]  The Lord s body was given for us so that we could receive His life and become His mystical Body, and the Lord s blood was poured out for us to make us worthy to receive His life to become His mystical Body.
[78]  A nominal Christian without the Lord s life or an unsaved false believer cannot remember the Lord, display His death, or await His coming, so if such a person eats the Lord s bread and drinks His cup, he is unworthy and is guilty of His body and blood.
[79]  We must know that the bread is not a bread of division, that the meeting is not treating the Lord s supper as something common, that we ourselves are not divisive, that we are not in disagreement with the brothers and sisters, and that we are not taking the Lord s supper lightly and eating it loosely.
[80]  If we do not eat the bread and drink the cup in an approved manner when we come together to break bread, we are guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.
[81]  If we do not discern whether the bread we break represents the Lord s physical body given up for His mystical Body, if we do not discern whether the bread represents the entire Body of Christ, the whole church, and if we break bread loosely, we eat and drink condemnation and judgment to ourselves.
[82]  Everyone who is learning to follow the Lord in life must pay attention to this matter.
[83]  When we receive the Son of God as our Savior, we have the Son of God, and we also have the life because this life is in the Son of God.
[84]  Now we have the Lord s life as our light, so our inner being is bright, and we can see what is right and what is wrong, what pleases God and what is against His will.
[85]  The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death Rom 8:2 .
[86]  THE SENSE OF LIFE When the Light of Life Shines within Us,
[87]  Since the light of life is the enlightening of the Lord s life within us, this enlightening causes us to have an inward sense of life.
[88]  Our sense that a certain matter does not please the Lord is also our inward seeing that this matter does not please the Lord.
[89]  God s law, which has been written on our hearts, and the law of the Spirit of life within us are both spontaneous functions of the Lord s life within us.
[90]  If we want to live out our salvation, we must obey God, who is operating in us, with fear and trembling; that is, we must obey the sense of life that comes from God s operation within us.
[91]  God causes us to do His will, doing in us that which is well pleasing in His sight not merely through outward Bible teaching or environmental leading but even more through operating within us to let us know His will and to give us the strength to do that which is well pleasing to Him.
[92]  CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO LIVING IN THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE
[93]  Living in the fellowship of life, like obeying the sense of life, is a very important and practical matter in the Christian life.
[94]  All those who pursue growth in the spiritual life must pay attention to this matter.
[95]  The fellowship of life involves the life of God entering into us and causing us to have a life-flow with God, the Lord, and all those who have the life of God.
[96]  In it we can share our innermost feelings and are mingled into one with God, the Lord, and all those who have the life of God.
[97]  That you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ 1 John 1:3 .
[98]  If we are in the fellowship of the apostles and in the fellowship of the church that they represent, we are also in the fellowship of God and the Lord.
[99]  Even though two believers have the Lord s life, they will not have the fellowship of life if either breaks his fellowship with the Lord.
[100]  When we fellowship with the Lord in His life, we abide in Him, just as a light abides in the power plant by abiding in the fellowship with the power plant.
[101]  If we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin 1 John 1:7 .
[102]  In the fellowship of life, if we are enlightened by the Lord s light to see our sins and then confess them to God, the blood of the Lord cleanses us from our sins.
[103]  Therefore, after we are saved, we can be cleansed from sin by the blood of the Lord in the fellowship of the Lord s life.
[104]  If our confession lacks the conviction that comes from the Lord s light, we will not receive the cleansing of the Lord s blood.
[105]  If we sin after we are saved, those sins must be confessed to God in order for us to be cleansed by the Lord s blood.
[106]  The Life Fellowship between the Believers and God Being Able to Be Broken
[107]  However, even a small problem with God, a little argument with God, a small amount of disobedience, or a tiny sin can break our fellowship in the Lord s life.
[108]  If we are willing to confess our sins to God according to the Lord s enlightening, He is faithful and righteous according to His Word to forgive and cleanse us from our sins because of the Lord s blood.
[109]  The love of Christ constrains us because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died; and He died for all that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised 2 Cor 5:14-15 .
[110]  The Lord s love in our hearts becomes a great power pressing us to love the Lord and to live to Him.
[111]  THE SIGNIFICANCE OF CONSECRATION Following the Will of God
[112]  God called us and saved us so that we could be gained by the Lord.
[113]  Therefore, when we consecrate ourselves to the Lord, we are following God s will.
[114]  Through His Spirit with His compassions, God s requirement in love for each of us is that we would present our bodies to Him.
[115]  The Lord s grace has prepared everything for us.
[116]  We make known to you...the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia, that... the depth of their poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality 2 Cor 8:1-2 .
[117]  The choice of our clothing and food, the spending of our money, the use of our time, the visiting of our friends, and everything in our living must be according to the Lord s heart s desire and to the Lord, not according to our own will and to ourselves.
[118]  An acceptable sacrifice, well pleasing to God...God will fill your every need according to His riches, in glory, in Christ Jesus Phil 4:18-19; see also the verses related to the points above, Enjoying What the Lord Has Prepared and Gaining the Lord s Blessing and Supply .
[119]  CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR DEALING WITH SIN THE MEANING OF DEALING WITH SIN Producing Fruits of Repentance
[120]  As soon as we repent and believe in the Lord, we should produce fruits of repentance.
[121]  Most of our sins offend others, so we should not only confess our sins to God but also to man.
[122]  We confess our sins to God because every sin that we commit offends Him.
[123]  Therefore if you are offering your gift...and there you remember that your brother has something against you...first go and be reconciled to your brother...Be well disposed quickly with your opponent at law, while you are with him on the way Matt 5:23-25 .
[124]  The Lord often connected forgiving others with prayer because if we do not forgive others, God will not forgive us, and there will be a separation between God and us.
[125]  Being led is a necessary part of the Christian life and service before God.
[126]  If we live in the Lord and follow Him, the Holy Spirit will often use this kind of forbidding and restricting to preserve us on God s track so that we can act according to God s will.
[127]  The Lord Jesus sheep hear His voice and follow Him.
[128]  Therefore, the Lord s voice also leads us so that we may follow Him.
[129]  We belong to the Lord, and we should pay attention to His voice and follow Him according to His voice.
[130]  God speaks in one way, / Indeed in two ways, without any perceiving it / In a dream, a night vision, / When deep sleep falls upon men...
[131]  These verses indicate that God speaks in one way, indeed in two ways, without man perceiving it; consequently, God uses dreams and visions to open man s ears and to instruct him.
[132]  We all with unveiled face, beholding...the glory of the Lord 2 Cor 3:18 .
[133]  A person who is closed to the Lord cannot see the light of His face and receive His leading.
[134]  Being Close to the Lord and Open to Him
[135]  God s intimate leading with His eye requires that we be close to and open to God.
[136]  If we are far from Him, we will not see how He is leading us with His eye.
[137]  The points that we have examined in this volume can be combined into several sets.
[138]  Chapters 17 through 20 cover four outward things that we should practice after being saved: baptism, the laying on of hands, head covering, and the breaking of bread.
[139]  Chapters 21 and 22 cover two inward matters that we should pay attention to after being saved: obeying the sense of life and living in the fellowship of life.
[140]  Chapters 23 through this chapter cover four things that we must practice if we want to live for the Lord: consecration, dealing with sin, being led by the Lord, and doing the will of God.
[141]  If we want to live for God, we must do the will of God.
[142]  That you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and well pleasing and perfect Rom 12:2 .
[143]  Therefore, we must stand on God s side in the reality of our consecration, be absolutely outside this age, and see God s view according to a mind that has been renewed and taught by God.
[144]  We must always use the clear teachings, principles, and examples of the Bible to measure and prove the will of God and to see whether or not our ways are one with the will of God.
[145]  Not everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens Matt 7:21 .
[146]  Although they preach, cast out demons, and do many works of power in the Lord s name, they do not do them in accordance with God s will and are workers of lawlessness in the Lord s eyes.
