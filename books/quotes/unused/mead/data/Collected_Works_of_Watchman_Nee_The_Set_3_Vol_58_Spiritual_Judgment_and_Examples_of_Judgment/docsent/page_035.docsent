   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 18 Date:July 17, 1948 TESTIMONY BY SISTER K. C.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I have seen that my body is the temple of the Holy Spirit and is made for prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the reason I spend a few hours every day praying.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Brother Nee returned from England in 1939 and spoke about God's purpose in creating man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At that time I made a strong consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I saw that anything that is not of Christ, no matter how good it may be, should be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 1942, I had many family affairs to attend to, but I could not move my hands because of weak health and rheumatism.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Later the Lord gave me the faith to reject this physical weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>My hands were healed, and I was able to do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 1945 my health took a turn for the worse again.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At one point there was blood in my sputum.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Meanwhile I still had to take a job.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I began to realize that I had loved myself too much and that I was full of the self in many things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>My limbs were completely without strength, Satan was attacking me, and my heart was full of fear.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I became very sick and my feet became numb.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One brother came to visit me and told me to stand up by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I stood up by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Prior to that I had been in bed for 85 days.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At first I was about to fall, but someone held me tight.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I declared the Lord's victory immediately, and the fear and the weakness went away.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When Brother Nee called the meetings in Shanghai, my heart was somewhat cold at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But I looked to the Lord to provide an opportunity for me to attend.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Later the Lord said to me, "You can never be wrong if you follow the footsteps of the flock."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>My inner man became stronger every time I opened my mouth in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When I heard the message on handing oneself over, I felt that I had become different.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now I am willing to serve Him under His headship and in submission to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Before a man's body receives the infusion of life, others touch death when they touch such a body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>With many people, the supply of the natural life has not run out.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As a result, they are not conscious of God's supernatural life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only after a man has lost his natural life supply does he begin to treasure the supernatural life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God supplies the resurrection life only to those who have need.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Paul was characterized by the little strength he had in his natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Actually, his physical body needed much energy to sustain him for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He accomplished more work than ten strong men.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Yet he was sustained by the supply of the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the reason he could do what others could not do.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whenever he labored for the Lord, he derived his very breath and pulse from his faith in God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This was his characteristic.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It tells us what kind of supply he received from God for his spiritual work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was able to say, "For when I am weak, then I am powerful" 2 Cor 12:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The times when he was weak were the very times when he was strong.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Those were his strongest times.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Such a spiritual contradiction occurs as one pays the price to learn the proper lessons before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should remember the Lord's word: "My power is perfected in weakness" 2 Cor 12:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This weakness was a weakness that Paul accepted.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He asked the Lord three times to have the thorn removed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today we do not know what this thorn was.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We only know that it referred to something that never left him, that irritated him and weakened him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Paul prayed three times and then stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>From that day forward, Paul accepted this weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If it had been an unwelcomed weakness, it would have done him no good.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Paul accepted this weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the reason he was different.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the reason he could boast in his weakness and the reason the power of Christ could overshadow him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Sooner or later the day will come when a man bows his head and says, "I accept the weakness that the Lord has placed on me."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Paul was not the only man who was weak, but he was one of the very few people who would accept his weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Most people bargain with God when they are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They have their own opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They murmur against God and wrestle with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>These ones will not see the power of God perfected in them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We know that there are more weak ones than strong ones in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But this does not mean that everyone who is weak will experience God's power being perfected in him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God's power is perfected only in those who accept the weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A man has to go through many scorchings, refinements, strugglings, and perils before he will bow his head, accept his weakness, and say, "I do not understand how I was lifted up.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Yet I am!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God has brought me through.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I am still physically weak, and my inward being is still crippled and imperfect.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Yet I am alive!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I have accepted my weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Holy Spirit spoke through Paul when he said, For when I am weak, then I am powerful.'</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It seems as if I am able to say the same thing now."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Once you reach this point and accept your weakness, you will spontaneously experience the next step, which is "when I am weak, then I am powerful."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>As for you, you will only boast in your weakness.</S>
