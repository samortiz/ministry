<h1 class="title">THE SINS OF ISRAEL IN FORSAKING JEHOVAH<br />
AND<br />
JEHOVAH&rsquo;S PUNISHMENTS ON ISRAEL<br />
BECAUSE OF THEIR FORSAKING OF HIM</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Hosea 7&mdash;8</h1>
<p>Chapters seven and eight of Hosea cover the sins of Israel in forsaking Jehovah and Jehovah&rsquo;s punishments on Israel because of their forsaking of Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE SINS OF ISRAEL IN FORSAKING JEHOVAH</h2>
<p>The sins of Israel were in two categories: sins in their social life among the people and the rulers and evils in their relationship with Jehovah. Israel was wrong with man and also with God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Sins in Their Social Life<br />
among the People and the Rulers</h2>
<p>Hosea 7:1-7 speaks of the sins of Israel in their social life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Falsehood, Theft, Raids,<br />
Evils, Lies, Intoxication, and Scorn</h2>
<p>Israel&rsquo;s sins in their social life included falsehood, theft, raids, evils, lies, intoxication, and scorn (7:1-3, 5). On the feast day of the king, the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine, and the king stretched out his hand with scorners.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Adultery Practiced by All of the People</h2>
<p>Adultery was practiced by all of the people. They burned like an oven in their lust, devouring their judges (the priests) and making all their kings fall (vv. 4, 6-7). Hosea used the parable of a baker to portray Israel&rsquo;s burning lust. Even the kings could not stand against the burning lust within them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Evils in Their Relationship with Jehovah</h2>
<p>In verses 8 through 16 Hosea speaks regarding Israel&rsquo;s evils in their relationship with Jehovah.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Wandering from Jehovah</h2>
<p>They wandered from Jehovah, not returning to Him and not seeking after Him (vv. 13, 10, 16a, 14).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Ephraim Being Likened to Three Things</h2>
<h2 class="head4">a. An Unturned Cake</h2>
<p>Ephraim (another term for the northern kingdom of Israel) was likened to an unturned cake (v. 8). This symbolizes that they were stubborn to remain in a charcoaled condition and would not turn to Jehovah.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. A Silly Dove</h2>
<p>Verses 11 and 12 say, &ldquo;Ephraim has become like a silly dove / Without understanding: / They call to Egypt; / They go to Assyria. / When they go, / I will spread My net over them; / I will bring them down like the birds of heaven; / I will chasten them according to the report given to their assembly.&rdquo; Israel&rsquo;s being likened to a silly dove symbolizes that they were lacking the proper knowledge of God in His economy. Many of today&rsquo;s Christians are lacking the knowledge of God&rsquo;s economy. They do not realize that God&rsquo;s present chastising of Israel and His punishing of the nations will issue in the manifestation of Christ to bring in the restoration.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. A Deceitful Bow</h2>
<p>In verse 16a Israel is likened to a deceitful bow. This symbolizes that they were rebellious toward God and were not faithful to fight the battle for God&rsquo;s kingdom.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> </body></html>
