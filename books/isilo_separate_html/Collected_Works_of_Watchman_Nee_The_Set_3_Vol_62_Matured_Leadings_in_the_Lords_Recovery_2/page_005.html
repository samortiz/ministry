Almost two thousand years. Has it passed through many places? We can say it has reached almost the entire world. How many people has it touched? Millions. After having been on earth for so long, passing through so many places and touching so many people, do you not think that the church has changed from its original state? In buying things, we want to buy them factory-made in an unaltered state. Do you realize that the church today is something that has been altered from its original state? If you buy a garment, do you want one that is unaltered or one that has been altered? Everyone wants an unaltered one. Unless we have the thought that the church has not been altered, we all should want to go back to the church in its original state. During the past two thousand years, the church has degraded. The church that we see today is no longer the same as the church at the beginning. Today our ground is the ground of recovery; we cannot be ignorant of this fact. The more questions we ask, the better. No matter from what angle we view Christianity, can we say that it is the same as the original church? We must remember that we do not save men to bring them into Christianity. If we only bring them to Christianity, there is a problem with our work. Hence, we should have as many questions as possible. Once we ask questions, we will take the way of God's recovery.</p><p>Since 1940, or perhaps 1939, the high point of God's recovery work in the church has been the raising up of the whole Body in His service. Not only do we see this truth in the Bible, but we also have this sense in our spirit. The entire assembly hands itself over to be trained and then to be sent out group by group in migration. This will afford God the opportunity to take a quick way among us. For five or six years, I was under the trial of illness as well as under pressure in the environment and opposition from men. All of these taught me precious lessons in life. According to the sense I received in my spirit during my time of fellowshipping with the Lord, I was clear that I have to train the saints to know coordination outwardly and to be perfected in life inwardly. Locally we have to preach the gospel, and extra-locally we have to move through migration. These are very crucial principles.</p><h2 class="head2">Satisfying the Demand of the Saints' Spirits</h2><p>We know the general principles above, but where do we start? We have to start with the small things. We can consider two angles. A church in a locality has to satisfy the inner demand of its own brothers and sisters internally, and it must also satisfy the need of outsiders externally. If we cannot meet the inner need of the brothers and sisters, we have a problem. Every brother and sister should be able to touch a supply when they come into the church life. If the church cannot supply them, something is wrong. We may not have anything wrong outwardly, but as long as we cannot satisfy the inner needs of the brothers and sisters, something is wrong with us. In every generation God bestows grace differently. What we see, taste, and hear today are things that men of former generations have never seen, tasted, or heard. For this we have to worship God with grateful tears. He has been too gracious to us. He has shown us these things. He has chosen to reveal these to us among all the people for the purpose of encouraging us to go to Him to take His way. The inner urge of the brothers and sisters is a sure sign that God is taking the way of recovery quickly. It is precious that they have this feeling. Presently, we see this happening in Tsingtao, Chefoo, Peking, and Shanghai.</p><p>For this very reason, I was forced to look to the Lord, because I realized that all of us are not fully captured by Him yet. Individually, we have not allowed God to get through in us completely. So many brothers and sisters in the church have this demand and urge within them, yet we cannot meet their need. I feel that we have to bear the responsibility of this entire matter before the Lord. Unless we take up this matter seriously, universal service and migration will be nothing but theories.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> </body></html>
