<p>Although the branches of a fruit-bearing tree may bear much fruit, none of the fruit is the result of the work of the branches. The branches simply absorb the sap, the riches of the tree, and fruit grows. If we say to the branches, &ldquo;You have worked too hard,&rdquo; they will respond, &ldquo;This is not true; we are simply bearing fruit.&rdquo; Actually, they are enjoying. They do not contribute anything or perform any work. They simply absorb the riches of the tree. The more they absorb, the more fruit they bear. The more they experience this inward enjoyment, the more they bear outward fruit. Fruit does not come from the branches. Fruit comes from the tree, and the branches are merely channels through which the sap flows. This process of life passing through the branches is an enjoyment. This is the Christian life.</p>
<p>God has no intention for us to do anything for Him. He has no intention for us to worship Him or serve Him in a certain way. I hope we understand this word and not misunderstand it. God desires to be only one thing to us. He presents Himself to us and places Himself within us for the purpose of being our enjoyment. The more we enjoy Him, the more blessed we are. The more we enjoy Him, the more we know Him and are able to bear fruit. The more the branches abide in the tree, the more they allow the elements of the tree to abide in them. The sap and riches of the tree flow through the branches and from them bear much fruit. This is what God desires from us.</p>
<p>We must change our concept. We need to see a vision. I have met many children of God in different places, and the more I spoke with them, the more I shook my head. It is difficult to find a person who knows God. It is almost impossible to find a person who knows God&rsquo;s grace. When we meet a child of God, we may feel that he is a pious, God-fearing man who seeks God. However, it is not easy to find a man who knows that God desires man to enjoy Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Prayer Being to Enjoy God</h2>
<p>A sister once complained to me that although she had been trying to exercise patience for many years, she still found it difficult. She said that she had been trying by praying. When I asked her how she prayed, she responded, &ldquo;My patience is sufficient for only five trials. After that my patience runs out. Hence, I tell the Lord that I have no patience, and I ask Him to grant me patience. I can only ask the Lord to help me.&rdquo; This is the prayer of a novice. An experienced person would tell others not to pray such a prayer. The more we pray this way, the less patience we will have. When I asked if it was possible to forget about being patient when praying, she said, &ldquo;But my problem is a lack of patience. I have to go to God to deal with my lack of patience. If I do not pray for patience, what should I pray for? Are you saying that if I lose my temper and am short of patience, it is wrong to pray? If I pray, should I not pray for patience?&rdquo; I smiled and said, &ldquo;Sister, it is right to pray, but some kinds of prayer are not really prayer. This can be compared to trying to eat with our nose rather than our mouth.&rdquo; This sister&rsquo;s problem was not a shortage of patience but a shortage of God. She did not need patience; she needed God. She needed to forget about patience and seize God instead. Some may consider <em>seize</em> to be a strong word. But she needed to spend time before the Lord and enjoy Him. She needed to absorb God. If God was added to her, she would have patience.</p>
<p>My word confused the sister, however, and she asked, &ldquo;How can I enjoy God? How do I absorb Him?&rdquo; This sister&rsquo;s confusion is typical of many Christians who are unclear about enjoying God. Even we are not clear; we are novices in knowing God, enjoying Him, touching Him, and fellowshipping with Him. While we want God, our way is often wrong and to no avail. We try to fellowship with God, but our way of fellowshipping is wrong. Many of our prayers are offered in a wrong way. We are wrong because we focus on things rather than on God; we lay hold of things rather than of God; we pray for things rather than for God. For this reason, we do not enjoy or absorb God.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>How to Enjoy God and How to Practice the Enjoyment of God &nbsp; pg 7</div><br></body></html>
