   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT INWARDLY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Furthermore, we need to be filled with the Spirit inwardly Acts 13:52; Eph 5:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need the essential filling of the essential aspect of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Spirit in its essential aspect, the Spirit of essence, the Spirit of life, is for our being, our life, our living, our existence.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have to be filled essentially in our inward being with such a Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>BEING FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT OUTWARDLY</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To be filled with the Spirit outwardly is the economical aspect of the Spirit Acts 4:31, 8; 13:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is the economical filling of the economical Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must have the Spirit of power economically for our work, for our doing, for our moving.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We all need to be filled with the Spirit in His two aspects we need to be filled inwardly so that we are full of life and filled outwardly so that we are full of power and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When I was young, I was taught that the inward and outward aspects of the Spirit were miraculous things that were hard to obtain.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One had to fast, pray, deal with many things, and wait on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But over the years, I found out from the Word and from my experience that the inward and outward filling of the Spirit are miraculous yet normal.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>D. L. Moody said that regeneration was the greatest miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What a miracle it is that a dirty, vile sinner could become a son of God!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Yet the experience of regeneration is very normal and transpires in a moment of time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As long as a person opens his heart to the Lord in prayer, believing into Him and calling upon His name, he gets regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is so normal, but it transpires by the Holy Spirit in our spirit; in this sense it is altogether miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Romans 10:8 indicates that this filling Spirit as the word is even in our mouth and in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we open up our mouth to call on the name of the Lord and confess all of our sins to Him, we are filled within spontaneously and normally.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We then need to exercise our faith that we have been filled with the Spirit both inwardly and outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To exercise our faith is to set our being upon the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We say amen to what God says in the Bible this is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Both the inward and outward filling of the Spirit are normal and easy for us to experience.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be a speaking one, we need the inward filling.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then we have the content.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We also need the outward filling.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then we have the power and the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We may have a burden to speak, yet it may be hard for us to speak because we are short of the infilling of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The infilling is short because our dealing with the Lord is not thorough.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We do not empty ourselves of things other than the Lord Himself to allow Him to fill us to the brim.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Also, if we do not have a proper dealing with the Lord, we will not be fully released to have the strong faith that we are clothed with the Spirit as our authority.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then our speaking will not be powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Instead it may be vain talk.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we deal with the Lord properly and adequately, we will have the assurance, the faith, that the Spirit of power is upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We believe this because the Bible tells us so.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then when we speak, our speaking will be powerful and prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We all need to practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we speak anything concerning Christ, we have to speak in a way in which we are exercising our spirit and even our whole being to believe the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should not speak anything concerning the Lord in a light way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we speak in the meetings, our speaking should be full of the exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our entire being must also be exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I saw certain saints speaking in the meetings with little, if any, exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It seemed as if they needed to lie down to get some rest.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to learn to speak in the same way that we speak when we lose our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whenever we speak in our temper, we speak by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our spirit is strong when we lose our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Without the exercise and release of the spirit, no one can lose their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This, of course, is the release of the spirit in a negative way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we speak in the meetings, however, we must learn in the same principle to release our spirit in a positive way.</S>
