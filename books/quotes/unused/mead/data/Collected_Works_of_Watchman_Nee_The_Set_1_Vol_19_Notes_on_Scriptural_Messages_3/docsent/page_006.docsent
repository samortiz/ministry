   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FOUR MINISTERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE NEW TESTAMENT Issue No. 46 Scripture Reading: Acts 9:20-28; Matt 4:18-22; Eph 1:22-23; 2:22; 1 Pet 2:3-5; 1 John 2:12-13; John 21:18, 21; Acts 28:23; 2 Tim 1:15; 2 Pet 2:1; 1 John 4:1; 2 John 7</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This morning I want to talk about four different ministers in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word minister, according to the Greek, refers not only to the deacons but also to the serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All who work for God and the gospel are ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>So when we say four ministers, we mean four different workers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the passages that we have just read, there are four different subjects, which are the four main subjects of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The ones who preached these four subjects are the four ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is a special thing in the New Testament: there were three disciples from among the twelve, who were with the Lord all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What are the names of these three disciples?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I think all of you know their names; they are James, Peter, and John.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They were with the Lord on the mount of transfiguration; they went with the Lord to the house of Jairus; and at the end, they were with the Lord in the garden of Gethsemane.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why did the Lord choose only these three from among the twelve disciples?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Why did the Lord put them in a more noticeable position?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The main reason was that God wanted to establish His works in the New Testament along three different lines.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But was it enough to have only three lines?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No, it was still not enough!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Acts the Lord brought in another minister besides these three.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Who was this man?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Was it Matthias?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No, even though Matthias was chosen as an apostle by casting lots, he was not the minister.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Who was chosen?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our beloved brother Paul was chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was one specially chosen by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although many people worked for the Lord in the New Testament, only these four occupy a unique position.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There were none besides these four.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to the Bible, the order of these four is as follows: 1 James, 2 Peter, 3 Paul, and 4 John.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the proper order of the Bible and is recognized by all believers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today we cannot exhaust the deeper significance of these four lines, but we can consider a little about them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We cannot see everything thoroughly and clearly; but as long as we see a little, some help will be rendered in our walk on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>JAMES</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>James is the most unnoticed one among the four.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He never wrote an epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The book of James in the Bible was not written by him, but by the Lord's brother.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Peter and John were both zealous men.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We can see many accounts of their work, but James did not do anything special.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He was a very hidden person.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How could he be listed among these four?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Why did the Lord choose him as one of the four to represent one special line?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>James did not manifest the gifts of preaching, healing, and works of wonders, etc. Although these gifts are good, James' outstanding trait was not in any of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What do we see in him?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He did one thing that was great and extraordinary; he was the first martyr among the apostles!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The most extraordinary and crucial line among these four is the line of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No matter how different were the works of Peter, Paul, and John, there was one line common to them all, the line of suffering and rejection.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Suffering is something that is basic to every Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today many people like to read Paul's excellent Epistles; they like to hear about Peter's zealous works and John's wonderful visions.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Yet they toss James aside and subconsciously forget about him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They do not realize that every work should be based on James.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Peter won three thousand people to the Lord in one day, and Paul established churches everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Yet without James's suffering, the Lord could not be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When the Lord came to this world, He took the standing of one who was rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we do not suffer with Him, we cannot satisfy His heart no matter what wonderful things we do.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Why did the Lord make James so hidden?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He only wanted to highlight one special point of James.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Suppose we have many chairs, several lamps, and numerous desks here.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are accustomed to seeing them and do not feel anything special about them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But if the items are moved away one day and the place is cleaned so that only one small desk remains, every brother would immediately notice the small desk.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If a crowd is here, you would not notice anything, but once all the people are gone and only one person is left, he will draw considerable attention.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is what the Lord did.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He hid every gift of James and only highlighted his suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the Bible Peter said to arm ourselves with a mind to suffer 1 Pet 4:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Only suffering overcomes everything and accomplishes God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Brothers, let me say an honest word.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Those who do not want to suffer with the Lord can never expect to be exalted with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Only those who suffer are worthy of being exalted.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you want to be highly exalted, you have to follow James's footsteps.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There is more truth concerning James which can render us much help.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, because of time, I cannot go further.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Now let us take a look at Peter.</S>
