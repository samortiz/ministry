   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Sin Offering</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us now consider how these five offerings are fulfilled in the cases recorded in chapters three through eleven of the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>With the case of Nicodemus in John 3, we have the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Nicodemus was a learned, aged, experienced, moral, religious, and God-fearing gentleman.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to his opinion of himself, he may not have been sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In a sense, Nicodemus was not sinful outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, he certainly was sinful inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This was the reason the Lord Jesus spoke to him concerning the brass serpent v. 14 . It was as if the Lord Jesus said to Nicodemus, "Nicodemus, you are very good in your outward behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But you still need Me to be the brass serpent as your substitute so that your serpentine nature may be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nicodemus, you may say that you are good in your conduct and character, but you cannot say that you are good in your nature.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In nature, Nicodemus, you are serpentine.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You have been bitten by the old serpent, and his poison has been injected into your being.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, in the sight of God, you are serpentine.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As a teacher of the Jews, you must know chapter twenty-one of the book of Numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That chapter says that your forefathers offended God and as a result they were bitten by serpents.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the sight of God, they all became serpents who were dying.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When Moses cried to God on their behalf, God told Moses to lift up a brass serpent on a pole.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That brass serpent had the form of a serpent, but it did not have the nature of a serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But that serpent became a substitute for the people to bear their judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whoever looked at that brass serpent was made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nicodemus, I am the reality of that brass serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must I, the Son of Man, be lifted up, so that whoever believes in Me may have eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After the Lord spoke to Nicodemus regarding this matter, Nicodemus had nothing further to say.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He understood the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In John 3 the brass serpent lifted up on a pole was the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This offering does not bear our sins; instead, it deals with the sin in our fallen nature.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Trespass Offering</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the next case, that of the Samaritan woman in chapter four, we have the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whereas Nicodemus was moral, the Samaritan woman was immoral, even though she was religious.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Samaritan woman had had five husbands, and she was now living with one who was not her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because she was such an immoral person, she needed a trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Burnt Offering</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In chapter seven of the Gospel of John Christ is the burnt offering, the One who was absolute for God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As the absolute One, Christ was for God's satisfaction, and He sought God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Meal Offering</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In chapter six we can see Christ as the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The meal offering in the Old Testament was made mainly of fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In John 6 the Lord Jesus says that He is the bread of life, the bread of God, the true and living bread that came down out of heaven vv.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>32-33, 35, 41, 51 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, He is the genuine meal offering to feed us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In all these cases we have the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, and the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If the Lord Jesus were not the offerings, He could not do anything for us, because between us and God there is the great problem of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The offerings deal with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Sins are the result, the outcome, of sin, and sin is the source of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If sin is dealt with, then sins will also be dealt with.</S>
