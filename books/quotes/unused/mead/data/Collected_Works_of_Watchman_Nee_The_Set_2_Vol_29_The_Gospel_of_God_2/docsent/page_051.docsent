   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SUMMARY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now let us summarize what we have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The future of Christians is very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For a saved Christian the question of the new heaven and new earth, including all eternity, is solved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But the age of the kingdom is controversial.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No one dares to say anything about what will happen.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What we have to solve today is the problem of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the kingdom there are many ranks of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many will reign with Christ because they have worked faithfully and have undergone persecution, reproach, and suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some may not have undergone persecution, reproach, and suffering, but they do not have sins either.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They have lived a clean life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although they have done nothing that deserves special merit, they have at least given a cup of water to a little one for the sake of the Lord's name Matt 10:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They will also receive a reward, but their reward will be very small.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the age of the kingdom, some Christians will receive a reward in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some will receive a great reward; others will receive a small reward.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who will not receive a reward are also divided into a few categories.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One group will not enter into the kingdom at all.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Bible does not tell us where they will go.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It only says that they will be kept outside the kingdom in the outer darkness Matt 8:12; 22:13; 25:30; Luke 13:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They will be left outside the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Second, there will be many who, in addition to not having worked well, have specific sins not yet dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They are saved, but when they die, they still have sins which they have not repented of and dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They still have the problem of sin with them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These ones will be temporarily put into the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They will come out only after they have paid all their debts.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This will last at most until the end of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I do not know how long this period will actually be.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There are still many things which we are not clear about concerning the future, but the Bible has shown us enough.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although there are details which we have not yet seen, we do know what the children of God will face.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some will receive a reward; some will go into corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some will be put into prison, and still some will be cast into the fire and be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The matter of our salvation is quite clear.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When a man trusts in the Lord Jesus, both salvation and eternal life are settled for him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But after a person is saved and up until he dies, his works, that is, his failures or his victories, will determine his fate in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our God is a just God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the one hand, our salvation is free, and those who believe will have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No one can overturn this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the other hand, we cannot sin at will just because we have received eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we bring forth thorns and thistles, we will be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If the Lord Jesus cannot disassociate us from our sins and if we have not settled everything in our lives, God has no choice but to chastise us in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He has no choice but to cleanse us with specific punishments, so that we can be together with Him in the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God is a just God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What He has prepared is also just.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once we have seen these things, we must learn the lesson and take the warnings from God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE PROPER ATTITUDE IN READING THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Concerning the way we study the Bible, I would like to mention a few things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>First, there is a group of people who believe only in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whenever they read about things related to the kingdom in the Bible, they apply it to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you listen to their sermons and read their books, they invariably push everything related to the kingdom onto the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Everything related to grace is for the church, and all the terrible things are for the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To them, everything burdensome, difficult, and demanding is for the Jews, not for us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is foolishness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God's Word is for His children, whether they are Jews or Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some say that Paul never specifically said that his Epistles were written to Gentiles, and therefore, they are not for Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But this kind of explanation explains away and cuts apart the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Others say that the portions of the Scriptures quoted earlier refer to unbelievers only.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But how can the distinction between overcomers and non-overcomers exist among the sinners?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is foolish talk.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Word of God shows us these matters in a clear and definite way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have to eat what God has given us, whether it is sweet or bitter.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When men hear about grace, they are happy; when they hear about the kingdom, they are unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But the Word is balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>On the one hand, we see grace; on the other hand, we see righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There is the fable of the eagle and the cat.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Once a cat met an eagle.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The eagle said to the cat, "The sky is really great.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It has this and it has that.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Would you like me to take you up to the sky?"</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The cat said, "No, I do not care to go there."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When the eagle asked why not, the cat said, "There are no mice in the sky.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If there were mice there, I would go.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But since there aren't, I won't."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Heaven is so holy; sin, the world, and Satan are not there.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If God brings you to heaven, will you be able to live there?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we do not turn today, we will have to wait until we are worthy to enter in. It is true that the Lord Jesus has saved us, but subjectively speaking, if we do not allow the Holy Spirit to work the Lord Jesus into us, God will have to chastise us that we may receive the benefit and be counted worthy to be with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we only preach grace without preaching the kingdom, the church will suffer and God's children will suffer; and when the kingdom comes, there will be even greater suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I must speak as I ought to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I admit that after my speaking in these few days, some will increase their opposition against me.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If these are my words, I am willing to see them opposed.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Even I myself would oppose them.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But if these things are the Word of God, and if God has spoken them, what can I do?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>How I wish that I did not have to talk about these things.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>How I wish that I could preach something that everyone would like to hear.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I am not Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I am not Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I am not Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I did not write the book of Hebrews, and I did not write Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If I were the writer, I could change things.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>But these things are God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>God has spoken them and determined that they should be so.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>My friends, when you read the Bible, you have to read what God has said.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>You must not consider what man has said.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>You should only care for what God has said.</S>
