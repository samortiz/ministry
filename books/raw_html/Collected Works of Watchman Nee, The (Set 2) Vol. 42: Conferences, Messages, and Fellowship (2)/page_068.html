<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-THREE</h1><h1 class="title">THE CROSS OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: December 16, 1936, evening<br />Place: Foochow</h1><h2 class="head1">GOD'S PROVISION MATCHING MAN'S NEED</h2><p>After man fell, a twofold problem emerged: the sins of man and the man of sin. In God's way of salvation, the sins of man are dealt with by the blood, but the man of sin is too wicked. There is no way to save him; he is corrupted to the core. God can only deal with this problem by removing the old man. It is impossible to change the nature of our old man; even God cannot change it. We are rotten throughout. Just as  a Cushite cannot change his skin and a leopard cannot remove its spots, the old man cannot be changed (Jer. 13:23). God's salvation must (1) remove our sins, (2) deal with our old man, and (3) give us a new man, which means that His Son, Christ, has to live within us. Once God's Son lives within man, it becomes easy for man to overcome sin. In fact, once God's Son lives within man, it will be as easy for man to live His life as it was for Him to live His own life on the earth.</p><h2 class="head1">THE OLD MAN BEING ABSOLUTELY INCURABLE</h2><p>Jeremiah 17:9 says, "The heart is deceitful above all things /And it is incurable;/Who can know it?" Twelve years ago I was conducting a conference in Amoy. One day I was thirsty, and I went with my friend to buy some pears. Each of us bought two nice looking pears, but when we tried to eat them, we found that all four pears had worms inside. I quizzed my friend, asking, "Did the worms come from outside the pears or inside the pears?" He said, "They came from outside, of course." I said, "No, the worms came from inside. When the pear tree blossoms, worms lay their eggs in the flowers, and when the fruit grows, the eggs are already within the pears. When the pears ripen, the eggs hatch and the worms come out." This is what it means when the Lord says that sin proceeds from man's heart. The most ugly sins that the Lord mentions in the Gospels proceed from the heart (Mark 7:21-23). The relationship between sin and the sinner is like that between tuber- culosis germs and tuberculosis itself. The cleansing away of our sins by the Lord's blood is like the removal of phlegm, whereas dealing with the old man is like treating the lung itself. In order to cure a man of tuberculosis, the infected parts of the lungs must be removed. Similarly, in order to deal with the person who is totally corrupted, the old man must be dealt with.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD'S WAY OF SALVATION</h2><p>Romans 6:7 tells us that a dead man is delivered from sin. We came into this world through birth. Hence, we can only be delivered from sin through death. We got into Adam through birth, and we get out of Adam through death. The cross means removal, and God removes our old man through the cross. God's unique way of removing the old man is for us to be crucified with the Lord. Only the cross has the power to remove the old man.</p><p>Let us now consider a few passages that speak of our relationship with the cross. Romans 6:6 says, "Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves." This act was accomplished once for all. The meaning of the word "annulled" is to abandon or cut off. In the original language it means to be cut off from employment. Therefore, a more accurate translation can be "unemployed." When our old man is crucified with Christ, our body of sin is unemployed.</p><h2 class="head1">SIN, THE OLD MAN, AND THE BODY OF SIN</h2><p>Sin, the old man, and the body of sin have the following relationships&mdash;sin is the master, the old man is the steward, and the body of sin is the slave. Sin is in the innermost part. The body is the outermost part. In between, there is the old man. Sin tempts, induces, and suggests from within. The old man in the middle consents, and the body outside is motivated to do the works. This is the way the three work together. In order for man to be delivered from sin, there are specific ways to deal with each of the three things. The world's way is to restrict the body and stop it from sinning. This only takes care of the outward body. Another so-called holiness group of believers suggests eradicating the root of sin from within man. They think that once the root of sin is removed, a man will no longer sin. But God's way, as revealed in the Bible, is to deal with the old man in the middle; it is to crucify the old man. Once the old man is crucified, the body is deprived of any power to transgress. Even when sin tries to tempt, induce, or make suggestions, the body will no longer respond. This is God's way of dealing with sin.</p><p>Every time man transgresses, he first experiences sin's instigation, then the old man's consent, and finally the evil acts of the body of sin. God's way of salvation is to crucify the old man. This causes the body of sin to be unemployed. By planting His own life in man, which is typified by the tree of life, He replaces the life of the old man and enables man to do God's will. In this way, when sin entices man to sin again, he will no longer succumb to its temptation, because the Lord's life is now living within man and He does not sin. Sin's temptations will never go away, but if the brain, eyes, mouth, and hands are not available for sin's employment, sin cannot do anything by itself. When the old man is crucified, the body of sin becomes unemployed. Once the old man is crucified, sin can no longer urge it to induce the body to commit sins. When the Lord crucified the old man, we were freed from our slavery to sin. The blood secures our salvation before God; it gives us a clear conscience and brings eternal life to us. This is objective and outward. At the same time, the cross secures our salvation before men; it deals with our heart and touches our living on this earth. It is subjective and inward.</p><p>Galatians 2:20 says that I have been crucified with Christ. The cross deals with the "I." Galatians 5:24 says, "But they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts." This verse does not say that sin was crucified on the cross. What God crucified was our person and all we have. Man's way is to improve, cultivate, or mortify himself. But God's way is to deliver our old man to the cross. Once I went to a person's home and saw a child about to take a pair of worn shoes for repair. The mother said, "The shoes are too worn; they cannot be mended. Go and buy a pair of new shoes instead." This is the way God deals with our old man.</p><p>The full gospel tells us two things. First, it tells us that the Lord has cleansed us from all sins. Isaiah 1:18 says, "Come now and let us reason together,/Says Jehovah./Though your sins are like scarlet,/They will be as white as snow;/Though they are as red as crimson,/They will be like wool." All our sins are washed away by the precious blood of the Lord. Second, the full gospel tells us that God has crucified the old man, the one whom we cannot deal with by any other means. Our self has been annulled by the cross. Galatians 6:14 says that through the cross we have been crucified to the world. As far as I can remember, there are only four verses that speak of the relationship between the cross and "I"; they are Romans 6:6, Galatians 2:20, 5:24, and 6:14.</p>
