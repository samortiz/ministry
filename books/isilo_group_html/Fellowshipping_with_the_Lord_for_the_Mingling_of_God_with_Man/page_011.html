<p>Here are nine points to help us practically learn the lesson of fellowshipping with God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Setting a Definite Time</h2>
<p>Because we are weak, we must set a definite time to fellowship with God. First Kings 18:21 says, &ldquo;How long will you go hopping between two opinions?&rdquo; Those who hop between two opinions cannot learn spiritual lessons. We must set a definite time to learn the lesson of fellowship. If we do not learn to enter into fellowship, the messages we have heard will not be useful to us. The Lord&rsquo;s teachings in Matthew 5&mdash;7 cannot be worked out by self-cultivation. They are lived out of a person who is under the rule of the heavens. When we are in fellowship with God, we can obey the heavenly rule, and God is lived out of us. Only in fellowship with God can we receive spiritual light. We must set a definite time to learn the lesson of fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having a Thorough Consecration</h2>
<p>The real meaning of fellowship is to be mingled with God. However, God must obtain our consent before He can do a work of mingling. Hence, it is necessary for us to begin our fellowship with a thorough consecration by handing everything over to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Turning First to the Spirit</h2>
<p>After our consecration, the activities of our mind, emotion, and will must first be brought under the examination of our spirit; otherwise, we should not do anything. This point is not easy to learn, because we are independent by nature. Since we desire to be mingled with God, after we consecrate ourselves, we should bring every matter first to our spirit, touch the feeling in our spirit, and wait for the command of our spirit. We should do what our spirit permits and not do what our spirit forbids. Whether a matter is great or small, it should be examined by our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Serious and Diligent</h2>
<p>Learning to fellowship is a serious lesson. A careless and casual person will not learn this lesson properly. Therefore, we should seriously and diligently exercise to learn the lesson of fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Ignoring Any Reasoning</h2>
<p>Reasonings are distractions from Satan. Hence, we should learn to ignore the analysis and reasonings in our mind. When we begin to reason, our fellowship will be interrupted. We should not care for being right or wrong in the details of our practice. We should care only for the principle of turning to our spirit and being directed by our spirit. When we focus on right or wrong, our fellowship is interrupted, and we fall into the trap of reasoning and analyzing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Exercising the Will</h2>
<p>In order to learn the lesson of fellowship, we should not wait passively to be moved by the Spirit. Instead, we need to actively exercise our will. This corresponds to the teaching of the New Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Believing</h2>
<p>We should learn to have faith and believe that we are in God&rsquo;s hand and under His leading and keeping. Whether or not we are right or wrong, He bears the responsibility for our fellowship. Without believing, we cannot learn to fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Building Up a Habit of Turning to Our Spirit</h2>
<p>In every situation we must be able to exercise our spirit. We must be those who turn toward our spirit, not toward the world. Some believers turn toward their spirit when they pray but turn away from their spirit after finishing their prayer. We must practice turning all the time. We should not wander out of our spirit. It is even best not to try to determine if we are in or out of our spirit. We should simply seek the Lord in our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living according to the Inner Sense</h2>
<p>We should not do anything if we have not touched the sense in our spirit. This means that we should not have any activity that is apart from the sense in our spirit. We should not be passive, nor should we exercise our will apart from our spirit. The exercise of our will must be under the direction of our spirit. We must build up the habit of turning our entire being to the spirit and doing everything in our spirit. If the Spirit does not move, we should not move. We should always be those who are stirring up our spirit.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Fellowshipping with the Lord for the Mingling of God with Man &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
