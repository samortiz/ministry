He was the chief editor of a very famous newspaper. One day he heard Mr. Moody's preaching, and he repented and believed in the Lord. Once he became saved, many people reported the story of his salvation in the newspapers of America. One day Mr. Chapman went into a town and stayed in the same hotel, in the room next to this man. Mr. Chapman knew him and asked if it were true that he was saved. He said, "I repented and believed in the Lord through hearing Mr. Moody's preaching. However, I knew about God's love when I was eighteen years old. When I was young I was a prodigal son. I left home at the age of twelve or thirteen for several years because I did not like being confined at home. At that time in my youth, I became very ill and ran out of money. I had to return home in disgrace. My father treated me very well, but I regretted going home. My father was old; his hair was white, and he was sick. Yet every day he forced himself to work to get a little bread for us to eat. There was never enough for three people to eat because the income was so low. I felt that I had made a mistake by coming back. I could no longer eat the bread which my father earned through his hard work. After my strength had increased some, I told him that I still wanted to go out. In my whole life I never saw him so sorrowful as on that day. He said, `You are not healed yet; why do you want to leave? If there is a piece of bread in this house, you will always have a share. If there is a piece of roof, you will always have a share. Why do you want to leave?' But I was determined to leave. Then he said, `My son, let me tell you: in my whole life, I have never desired to be rich. But today I wish I had a fortune because of you; I wish I could have more money saved for you so that you would not have to wander outside. Perhaps someone will help us in the future. Why do you want to go out?' However, I had to go. I could not bear to eat my father's hard-earned bread anymore. Eventually he said, `My son, may God bless you! After today I will not see you again; but perhaps I will see you again in heaven!' He escorted me out of the house. We walked for half a mile, during which neither he nor I said a word. We walked like this for one mile. He was tired and could not go forward anymore and had to bid farewell. Until that day I did not know how hard it is to leave home! He had not walked back more than two steps when he turned back and called me. With tears in his eyes, he took out a half-dollar from his pocket and gave it to me, saying, `This is for you.' I knew what this half-dollar meant. I knew all that my father had on earth was that half-dollar. I knew what was in that half-dollar. That was the first time in my life that I realized my father loved me! The weather was rainy and cold as I saw my father going home, but my heart was very warm. I was singing, `My father loves me!' From that day on I was not a prodigal son. I decided that the first thing that I would do was reduce my father's burden. If I earned a dollar, I would mail it to him because he loved me. From that day forward, I became another person. This does not mean that before that time my father did not love me. But at the time of my destitution, I realized that he loved me. One day I heard Mr. Moody preach the following words: `Everyone talks about the father's prodigal son, but today I want to talk about the prodigal son's father.' When I heard that the Father was the same as my father, I believed and received the Lord Jesus as my Savior."</P><P>O brothers and sisters, I have known this God for at least eleven years. Although this is not very long, I know the kind of heart that He has. Do not suppose that you can do something to turn God's heart or please Him. He loves you and wants you to be saved. He does not need you to turn His heart. Many people say, "God does not tell me that He loves me." But please take a look at the cross, and you will know that He has already loved you. You should have received the punishment of the cross, but He made the Lord Jesus suffer it for you because He loves you.</P><P>What is love? Love is not words. The deepest kind of love cannot be expressed in words. The prodigal son was prepared to say to his father, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants" (Luke 15:18-19). But when he was yet a great way off, his father had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him. A father's heart shortens the distance of sin. When his father kissed him, he knew his father's heart. His father did not say, "I love you," but as soon as he kissed him, the prodigal son knew his father's heart. He could not say the words, "Make me like one of your hired servants." He could only say in his heart, "My father loves me." Please do not misunderstand God's heart. Please come to the cross. Jesus has already died for you; this should show you what is in God's heart already. When you see the blood of the Lord Jesus, you will know how much God loves you.</P><P>"Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto him, I have given unto thy master's son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house. Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the land for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy master's son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy master's son shall eat bread alway at my table...As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table, as one of the king's sons" (2 Sam. 9:9-11). How marvelous that there is not one condition, not one commandment; there are only promises. It does not say how much one should work. Everything was given. This is grace. If we understand God's heart, we cannot but believe in Him.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> </body></html>
