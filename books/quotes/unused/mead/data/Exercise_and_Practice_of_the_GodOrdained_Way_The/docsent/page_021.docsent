   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE SIX THE GLORY AND JOY OF THE BELIEVERS IN BEARING FRUIT Scripture Reading: John 15:8-11; 1 Thes 2:7, 11, 19-20</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first crucial item in the Lord's move on the earth is gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We are stressing not only gospel preaching but also the God-ordained way of preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today gospel preaching among most Christians is virtually bankrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Supposedly the United States is the top Christian nation on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There may be as many as one hundred twenty million Christians in the United States, and many Christian broadcasts are sent over the air waves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, very few of these millions of Christians have the burden to personally go out to preach the gospel of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the present situation among most of the Christians in America.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE FATHER BEING GLORIFIED BY OUR BEARING FRUIT</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may like the matter of abiding in the vine, abiding in Christ, which is found in John 15.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may desire to be those enjoying the unsearchable riches of the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, John 15:8-11 does not stress abiding only; it also stresses fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we bear fruit, the Father will be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Father will not be glorified just by our abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He will be glorified only if we are bearing fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only fruit-bearing can release the Father's divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we bear fruit, the very divine life which is in the Son, the vine, is released.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As we are abiding in the Son, we are absorbing the life which is in the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are participating in the unsearchable riches of the life-juice of the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sooner or later, the life we have been absorbing will be released.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When this life-juice is released, it issues in fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Fruit-bearing is the issue, the result of our enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is this releasing of the life-juice that expresses God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the releasing of the life-juice, the Father is glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>An illustration of such a release can be seen in the carnation flower.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the carnation does not bloom, then its glory, its beauty, remains hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the carnation does bloom, the inner life of the carnation has been released.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the glorification of the carnation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We cannot appreciate the beauty of the carnation if it has not blossomed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The carnation is hidden, and the beauty of its life is not yet expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once it blossoms, its life is expressed; its life is glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The blossom is the glorification of the carnation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the same way, our fruit-bearing is God's glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some in Christianity may say that we glorify God by doing something good.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They do not realize that the Father does not want us just to do good things or just to express Him in Christian ethical duties.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He wants us to express Him in bearing fruit for the vine tree's increase and enlargement.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The increase and enlargement of the vine is the Father's glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Have you noticed how particular the Lord's words are in this portion of John 15?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He says, "In this is My Father glorified" John 15:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"In this" refers to fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we bear much fruit, the Father is glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In John 15:9 the Lord Jesus says, "As the Father has loved Me, I also have loved you; abide in My love."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We Christians like to talk about love.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We like to say that God loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From my youth, I was taught to sing the hymn which says, "Jesus loves me this I know, for the Bible tells me so."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Here the Lord Jesus says, "As the Father has loved Me, I also have loved you."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What kind of love is this?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Father has loved the Son in the Son's expression of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Father is happy and joyful that the Son is His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Son has loved the disciples in the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Son wants the disciples to be His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>An illustration of this principle is in the book of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When God created man in His own image Gen 1:27 , this was an expression of His great love.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God loved the Son that the Son may express God, and the Son has loved us that we may express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>"As the Father has loved Me, I also have loved you; abide in My love" John 15:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To abide in His love makes us His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He tells us of His love, and then He charges us to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To bear fruit is to express the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Son charges us to bear fruit which means that the Son loves us to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What a privilege!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What a right the Son has given us that we may bear His fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Just as the Father charged the Son to express the Father, the Son charges us to express the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He charges us to abide in His love, not just to abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is not adequate simply to abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must abide in His love.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We abide in His love by bringing Him forth into people for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Our preaching the gospel is to bear fruit, to bring forth Christ into people, making them Christ's fruit, Christ's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When we bring Christ into a sinner, he becomes Christ's very expression.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Verses 8, 9, and 10 of John 15 are all connected.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we keep the Lord's commandments, we will abide in His love v. 10 , we will bear fruit v. 8 , and the Father will be glorified v. 8 . When we bear much fruit, the Father is glorified more.</S>
