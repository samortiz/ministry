   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In 1:1 Paul indicates that the truth is according to godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The truth, the reality, of God's eternal economy is according to godliness, which is God manifested in man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Apostleship is the dispensing of this reality to God's believing elect and the carrying out of such a godliness among them through preaching, teaching, and administration in the Word and in the Spirit 1 Tim 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 2 Paul goes on to say, "In the hope of eternal life, which God, Who cannot lie, promised before times eternal."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul was an apostle not only according to the faith and the knowledge of the truth, but also in the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This corresponds to "according to the promise of life" in 2 Timothy 1:1.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the hope of eternal life means on the basis of, on the condition of, relying upon the hope of, eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Eternal life, the uncreated life of God, is not only for us to partake of and enjoy today, but also for us to inherit Matt 19:29 in its full extent for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today's experience of eternal life qualifies us to inherit it in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Its enjoyment today is a foretaste; the full taste will be the inheritance of it in the coming age and in eternity, which is the hope of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the blessed hope revealed in 2:13, which is comprised of the freedom of the glory of full sonship, the redemption of our body Rom 8:21-25 , the salvation to be revealed in the last time 1 Pet 1:5 , and the living hope of the incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading inheritance reserved in heaven 1 Pet 1:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the full, spiritual, divine, and heavenly blessing and enjoyment of eternal life, both in the millennium and in the new heaven and new earth 2 Pet 1:11; 3:13; Rev 21:6-7 , referred to in 1 Timothy 4:8.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul assumed his apostleship and accomplished his apostolic ministry, not based upon the benefit of the present life, nor on the condition of the privilege of the law, but based upon the condition of this hope, indicating that for his apostleship he relied upon and trusted in the divine life with all its hope, which God promised in eternity and which was brought to us through the gospel 2 Tim 1:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Epistle to Titus is occupied with the maintenance of order in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For this, the faith of God's chosen ones, the truth according to godliness, and eternal life are indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, in the very opening word these three things are set forth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Eternal life is the divine life, the uncreated life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not only everlasting, lasting forever, with respect to time, but in its nature it is also eternal and divine.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The eternal life of God is given to all believers in Christ 1 Tim 1:16 and is the main element of the divine grace given to us Rom 5:17, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This life has conquered death Acts 2:24 and will swallow up death 2 Cor 5:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was according to the promise of such a life that Paul was an apostle 2 Tim 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This life and its consequent incorruption have been brought to light and made visible to men through the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eternal life was "promised before times eternal."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This must be the promise of the Father to the Son in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Father chose us in the Son and predestinated us unto sonship through Him Eph 1:5 before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It must have been in that eternal epoch that the Father promised the Son that He would give His eternal life to His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By receiving this life the believers, who were given to Him in eternity John 17:2 , would become His brothers Heb 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In verse 3 Paul continues, "But in its own times has manifested His word in the proclamation with which I was entrusted, according to the command of our Savior God."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The phrase "its own times" refers to the times not times eternal of the eternal life mentioned in verse 2.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It denotes the proper time for the eternal life to be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The phrase "His word" in verse 3 is equal to eternal life in verse 2.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This corresponds to 1 John 1:1 and 2.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>B. To Titus, a Genuine Child according to the Common Faith</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In verse 4 Paul says, "To Titus, genuine child according to the common faith: grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Titus, like Timothy 1 Tim 1:2 , was Paul's genuine child not by natural birth, but in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was Paul's child spiritually in the sphere and element of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The common faith in this verse is the general faith, which is common to all believers, the like precious faith 2 Pet 1:1 .</S>
