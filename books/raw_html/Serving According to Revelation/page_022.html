        <h2 class="head1">HAVING THE DESIRE FOR MIGRATION</h2>
<p>We should have the desire to migrate. God has ordained that we would live our life as sojourners. Migration is a necessary outlet of the gospel of God and the best outlet of His gospel. If we settle down in a place, the gospel will not have an outlet, and it will be held back. Hence, we have to migrate in order for the gospel to have an outlet. If we want the gospel to spread throughout Taiwan, the saints must migrate to every city. It is not sufficient to merely have a few preachers who go out to spread the gospel. We must have many saints who migrate to every place. May more saints be willing to seek the Lord&rsquo;s grace in this matter so that they would have the inclination and the desire to migrate for the gospel and to be sojourners, people who are always moving.</p>
<p>If we love the Lord and desire to live for Him and please Him, we will choose to migrate. This is the type of life that the Lord wants us to live, and this is also the way to please Him. We must be determined to travel throughout Taiwan and to live in every town. Although migration is difficult, it is the way to spread the gospel and to raise up the churches. Hence, such difficulty is worthwhile. May we be those who look to the Lord for His grace to have such a determination.</p>
<p>Judges 5:15-16 says, &ldquo;By the watercourses of Reuben / There were great resolves of heart. / Why sattest thou among the sheepfolds, / To hear the pipings for the flocks? / At the watercourses of Reuben / There were great searchings of heart&rdquo; (ASV). As Jacob&rsquo;s firstborn, Reuben should have been preeminent in dignity and power. However, he committed a gross sin when he defiled his father&rsquo;s concubine (Gen. 49:3-4). His descendants were children of a sinner, but there were watercourses among them. According to Psalm 23:2 and Jeremiah 17:7-8, watercourses signify God and His grace. This means that God&rsquo;s grace came upon the descendants of Reuben. Some of his descendants were sitting beside the watercourses, beside God, and by the grace of God, they had great resolutions of heart and great searchings of heart for the kingdom of God. Some of Reuben&rsquo;s descendants, however, enjoyed sitting among the sheepfolds to hear the pipings for the flocks. This means that they rested and did not move, because they desired a life of ease, comfort, and amusement. Likewise, many saints are not willing to receive the grace of God in order to have great resolutions of heart and great searchings of heart, because they desire a life of ease and comfort.</p>
<p>Human life is wicked and corrupt, but we have watercourses of God&rsquo;s grace by which we can have great resolutions of heart and great searchings of heart. Many saints do not make resolutions, because they yearn for a life of ease and comfort. To settle down is to live a life of ease, comfort, and pleasure, but to migrate is laborious and difficult. However, settling down will not enable us to enjoy God&rsquo;s grace. Migration is the way for us to enjoy the grace of God. Do we want to ignore God&rsquo;s grace by settling down to enjoy ease and comfort? Or do we want to be supplied by His grace to go out and enjoy more grace? Do we want to sit restfully among the sheepfolds and listen to pleasant music? Or do we want to be at the watercourses of God&rsquo;s grace to have great resolutions of heart and great searchings of heart for the Lord? May we be willing to flee the enjoyment of our own ease and comfort in order to draw near to the grace of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOW TO PRACTICE</h2>
<p>We will now consider the steps to take in order to practice migration.</p>
<p>The saints in the churches should go before God and seek whether they should migrate.</p>
<p>Those who are touched and willing to migrate should fellowship with the responsible brothers in their locality and decide on what action to take.</p>
<p>The saints should migrate to places based on their desire and on the condition of their living and employment.</p>
<p>In the first stage of migration we should go to places where there are saints but not established churches. Places such as Hualien, Taitung, Changhua, and Taoyuan need to be strengthened so that churches may be established.</p>
<p>If this is the work of the Lord&rsquo;s grace, some brothers should migrate to Tainan, Taichung, and Chiayi in order to strengthen the brothers who bear responsibility in these localities.</p>
<p>Some brothers should migrate to places where there is a prayer meeting and strengthen the saints to have the bread-breaking meeting. There are places where there is a bread-breaking meeting, but the testimony is not strong enough. Some brothers should migrate to strengthen such places. Other brothers should go to nearby places in order to raise up churches. I hope that churches would be raised up in every place by migrating saints, not by preachers.</p>
<p>The churches should offer material gifts in order to take care of the needs of the saints who migrate from their locality. For example, a brother in Pingtung may have the desire to migrate to Taitung. When he is in Pingtung, he has no worries concerning his livelihood, but when he migrates to Taitung, he may have a problem related to his livelihood. The church in Pingtung should take care of his need and help him solve such a problem. All the churches should do their best to supply the saints who desire to migrate. This will enable the migrating saints to go out, family by family, for the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A FINAL WORD</h2>
<p>Migration is an important matter because it is the way for the gospel to go forth and for churches to be raised up. Migration enables us to supply others with the grace that we have received and to fellowship with others concerning what we have experienced. We will bring our spiritual experiences to the places where we migrate, and we will also bring what we have learned in administrating and serving the church. After we migrate, we will spread out further. In this way churches will be raised up quickly in every place. Migration will enable us to proceed step by step and thereby avoid wasting our time and manpower. Furthermore, those who migrate out will receive fresh experiences of grace to become fresh, living, and useful.</p>
<p>As those who love the Lord, we should care for His desire and migrate to every place. We have been commissioned with the Lord&rsquo;s gospel because we have received His grace; hence, those whom we contact will also be commissioned with the gospel by receiving His grace. The more we migrate, the more we will be commissioned with the gospel and receive grace. May the responsible brothers in every locality stir up the saints with the desire to migrate so that many more saints will practice migration.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
