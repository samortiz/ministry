	<h1 class="msg">Message Five</h1>
<h1 class="title">The All-inclusive Christ<br />
in His Four Stages according to<br />
God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy<br />
(1)<br />
In the Stage of His Incarnation</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Isa. 52:14&mdash;53:3;<br />
1 Cor. 1:22-24; 2 Cor. 8:9; Mark 6:1-6</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The purpose of God&rsquo;s move in the stage of His incarnation is:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To bring God into man&mdash;Matt. 1:20-21, 23; Isa. 7:14; 9:6.</li>
	<li>To make God man that man may become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead&mdash;John 1:1, 14; 12:24.</li>
	<li>To mingle God with man that God and man may be one&mdash;Lev. 2:4-5.</li>
	<li>To accomplish God&rsquo;s redemption for man&mdash;Rom. 8:3; 1 Pet. 1:18-20; Heb. 9:26, 28, 12; 2:14.</li>
	<li>To carry out God&rsquo;s salvation in man&mdash;1 Tim. 1:15.</li>
	<li>To impart the divine life into man&mdash;1 John 4:9.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The incarnated Savior is the arm of Jehovah; the arm of Jehovah is God Himself in His saving power&mdash;Isa. 53:1b:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When the Lord Jesus came out to preach the gospel, that was the unveiling of the arm of Jehovah&mdash;Luke 4:14, 18-19; Mark 1:14-15.</li>
	<li>The Old Testament term is <em>the arm of Jehovah;</em> the New Testament term is <em>the power of God</em>&mdash;1 Cor. 1:24.</li>
	<li>Although Christ was unveiled as the arm of Jehovah, many did not see that He was Jehovah Himself coming in power to save them; they did not believe, because He grew up like a tender plant before Jehovah and like a root out of dry ground&mdash;Isa. 53:2a; John 1:46; Matt. 13:55.</li>
	<li>When the Lord Jesus comes back, the remnant of Israel will repent and wail and be saved (Zech. 12:10-14; Rom. 11:26-27); at that time they will confess the contents of Isaiah 53, and this chapter will be full of taste to them.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>As the complete God, signified by the arm of Jehovah, the power of God, Christ became a perfect man, signified by a man of sorrows&mdash;vv. 1b, 3a; John 1:1, 14; 1 Tim. 2:5:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The arm of Jehovah is Jehovah in His power, and the man of sorrows is Jesus; when these two are added together, they equal incarnation.</li>
	<li>In 1 Corinthians 1:22-24 <em>Christ crucified</em> corresponds to the <em>man of sorrows</em> in Isaiah 53:3, and the <em>power of God</em> corresponds to the <em>arm of Jehovah</em> in verse 1.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>As a perfect man, the Lord Jesus lived a lowly and sorrowful human life&mdash;vv. 2-3:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>He grew up like a tender plant before Jehovah and like a root out of dry ground&mdash;v. 2a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The plant here refers to a sprout, which is tender, small, and delicate; because He was such a small, delicate person, no one would pay attention to Him.</li>
		<li>He grew up like a root out of dry ground, which signifies a difficult environment; this means that He was born of a poor family&mdash;v. 2a; Luke 2:21-24; cf. Lev. 12:8; 2 Cor. 8:9.</li>
		<li>The Lord Jesus was raised in the home of a poor carpenter in the despised town of Nazareth and in the despised region, Galilee; this was the fulfillment of the dry ground in Isaiah 53:2a.</li>
		<li>The Lord&rsquo;s environment being one of dry ground means that His environment did not render Him any help at all:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Everything that He had was from God; He did not receive or expect anything from His surroundings that would encourage, support, or comfort Him.</li>
			<li>Our Lord had God&rsquo;s will as His satisfaction all His life; He was satisfied only with God&mdash;John 4:34; 5:30; 6:38.</li>
			<li>Our Lord was never discouraged (Isa. 42:4; 49:4); He had no hope toward the world and did not expect to receive anything from it; His only hope was in God, and His only satisfaction was in God.</li>
			<li>Those who take their satisfaction in God will never be disappointed&mdash;John 4:13-14.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>He had no attracting form nor majesty that men should look upon Him&mdash;Isa. 53:2b:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Jesus had neither an attracting form, nor did He have a beautiful appearance; He did not have any form or comeliness that would cause others to appreciate Him.</li>
		<li>Instead of majesty, Jesus had poverty (Matt. 8:20), and instead of an attractive form and a beautiful appearance, He had a visage and form that were marred (Isa. 52:14).</li>
		<li><em>Visage</em> denotes the appearance and also refers to the face or facial expression; Christ&rsquo;s face and His form were marred (disfigured) in order that He might save us; this is astonishing, different from what people expected Christ as a servant of God to be&mdash;v. 15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ was despised and forsaken of men, like one from whom men hide their faces and whom men do not esteem&mdash;53:3.</li>
	<li>The Lord Jesus lived as a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; this was a part of Christ&rsquo;s qualifications for accomplishing redemption&mdash;v. 3a.</li>
	<li>He was a &ldquo;man whose chief distinction was, that His life was one of constant painful endurance&rdquo; (Keil and Delitzsch).</li>
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s being such a man and His living such a lowly and sorrowful human life fully qualified Him to be the Redeemer and the Savior to save us from Satan, sin, death, and self&mdash;Heb. 2:14-18; Matt. 1:21; Rom. 8:3; 2 Tim. 1:10; Matt. 16:24-25.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Mark 6:1-6 may be regarded as a fulfillment of the prophecy in Isaiah 53:2-3:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Nazarenes, blinded by their natural knowledge, knew the Lord Jesus according to the flesh, not according to the Spirit&mdash;Mark 6:2-3; 2 Cor. 5:16.</li>
	<li>Only in the Gospel of Mark is the Lord Jesus called a carpenter&mdash;6:3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Carpentry is not a magnificent work, but it requires much fineness and patience; in such a work the Lord Jesus was found in fashion as a man (Phil. 2:8), not in loftiness but in lowliness, fineness, and patience.</li>
		<li>In Mark 6:3 the word <em>carpenter</em> is used in a despising manner:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Nazarenes were astounded by the Lord&rsquo;s teaching, by His wisdom, and by His works of power, but they regarded Him as a person of low status&mdash;vv. 2-3.</li>
			<li>They were stumbled in Him because, although they heard wonderful words out of His mouth and saw some of His marvelous deeds, they considered that He did not have a high status or degree.</li>
			<li>They saw the Lord Jesus as one who was merely a carpenter; therefore, they were stumbled in Him, and they despised Him.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The record in Mark 6:1-6 should cause us to ask ourselves what we want and what we value.</li>
	</ol></li>
