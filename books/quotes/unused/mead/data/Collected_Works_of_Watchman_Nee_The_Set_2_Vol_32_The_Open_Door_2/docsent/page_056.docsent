   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NEWS OF THE WORK A Letter from Brother Watchman Nee, England</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>My work here has experienced much blessing from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Praise His name.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many people hope that we will be able to put the truth that we have been given and have learned from the Lord into English.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I myself see the real need for this work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The English-speaking world is indeed poor.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, unless this is absolutely of the Lord, I would not like to initiate anything.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We ourselves must be bound in order for the work to remain pure and of spiritual worth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many people are exalting me highly here.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yet my eyes are set only on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I refuse to do anything based on outward prompting.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As one who has learned the lesson of the cross, none of these things can cause me to regard myself one bit higher.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If a man knows the meaning of conformity to His death, how can he seek glory from men again?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But I must say that the Lord has indeed been gracious to me here.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Praise His name.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One thing has been on my mind for many years, which is that the brothers are so easily satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There are indeed many ways not yet traversed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But some are satisfied with what they have already!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It seems that much solid food does not have the right kind of recipients!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This time the Lord has been gracious to me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I have met a number of people not too many who are deep in the Lord and who speak of the deeper things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You know that I never demand to be considered a teacher by others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What an evil attitude that would be!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I have always waited for others to ask me.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The same is true this time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord has touched others to come to ask of me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They receive the help, and I receive the reviving.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I feel that if I write any book, I should write it in Chinese first and then have it translated into English.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But I cannot say under the present circumstances that I am clear about the Lord's mind.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The money sent to you was from two or three brothers and sisters who exhausted their means to support the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Other than these few people, material giving among most others, and even among the zealous ones, does not come up to the standard of our own brothers in China.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some will give only if others ask them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such people have nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No matter how difficult our condition is, we have to maintain what we are holding fast to before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Trials are everywhere, but the God we believe in is the living God!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Once the Lord shows me that I have gained what He wants me to gain here, I will set out for my homeward journey.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How I long to walk in God's will exactly according to His timing, without being too quick or too slow!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Realizing the urgency of the situation around us, I am all the more fearful of having my own way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Sometimes I feel forlorn at the thought that the co-workers are all scattered everywhere and we are not able to gather together in one place.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>May our scattering be for the accomplishment of the Lord's will.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The reports in the The Open Door have stirred up praises to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Yet our prayer to the Lord is that the younger co-workers will know the cross and how it deals with the flesh and the natural life!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Brother Watchman Nee, the evening of the fifteenth</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A Letter from Chang Kwang-rong</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I left Shanghai on August 12 and arrived in Fu-Ting on the afternoon of the fourteenth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I believe this trip was under the Lord's leading, having received the light from the book Rethinking Our Work.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After a long period of prayer and waiting, I unexpectedly met the responsible brother of Fu-Ting, Brother Wu Sho-liang.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He came as a buyer for merchandise but related the need of workers in the churches there.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Subsequently, I went with him to Fu-Ting.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Fu-Ting is a border region between the provinces of Fukien and Chekiang; it is surrounded by mountains on four sides.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When I first arrived, I was not well-adjusted to the climate and felt somewhat ill.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>By the Lord's grace I soon recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I conducted some perfecting work internally for the believers and preached the gospel for a few days to the outsiders.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Most of the brothers and sisters are illiterate.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Yet their desire to know the Lord is stronger than their desire to read.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Their prayers are sincere.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The meetings are held at Brother Wu's house.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He and his three sons have a dye shop.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In addition to their own living quarters, they have built two more rooms to be used for the meetings, with one upstairs to be used for guest houses.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Brother Wu manages his house very well and is very hospitable.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I was quite touched by him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Although there are only about twenty people breaking bread together, they all love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When it comes time to preach, over a hundred come.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Although Fu-Ting is between two provinces and is surrounded by mountains, the brothers from Ping-Yang and Tai-Shun come all the time for fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Brother Chan Chin-fa said, "The meeting hall in Fu-Ting is a station for the brothers from Ping-Yang."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>After I arrived in Fu-Ting, the co-workers from Ping-Yang and Tai-Shun, such as Brothers Chen Chin-fa, Hwang Li-chuan, Jin Tze-fang, and Chou Dah-chin, all came and participated in instructing and teaching us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Over a few dozen places invited me to go to them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I felt quite fearful.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I ask that the Lord be merciful to me and trim me so that I can be more humble and obedient.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I only want to be a pure vessel and a faithful slave in His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I do not want to disappoint the brothers' love or bring shame to the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>After I finish the portion that the Lord has assigned to me, the Lord willing, I will leave Fu-Ting on the ninth of this month and go to Ya-Yang Village in Tai-Shun, Chekiang, and from there I will go to Shi-Si.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Please pray for this.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Brother Chang Kwang-rong, Fu-Ting, September 3</S>
