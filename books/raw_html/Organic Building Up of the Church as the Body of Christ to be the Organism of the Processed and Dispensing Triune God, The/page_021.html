 <h2 class="head1">THE INTRINSIC FACTOR OF THE WINDS OF TEACHING<br />
FOR THEIR PURPOSE</h2>
<p>Prayer: Lord, how we thank You that You have brought us through the past four meetings. Our trust is still in You. We do not have any trust in ourselves. Lord, our trust is in Your blessing. Without Your blessing, we cannot do anything. Lord, cover us, cleanse us, and forgive us of all our sinfulness. Be with us. Grant us Your rich anointing with Your holy ointment. We need this. We need Your presence. We need Your up-to-date speaking. We need Your speaking in our speaking. Lord, vindicate Your recovery. We want to be one with You, in one spirit with You. Lord, defeat the enemy and gain the victory for Your kingdom and for Your spreading. Gain the victory in the preaching of the gospel, in the home meetings, in the perfecting of the saints, and in the prophesying for the organic building up of Your Body. Lord, while we are fighting for Your kingdom, we could never forget our enemy who is Your enemy. We accuse him before Your throne of authority. Lord, we ask You to defeat him and shame him to the uttermost. May all the glory be Yours, and may all the blessings be upon us. Thank You. Amen.</p>
<p>In the previous chapters, we have covered four intrinsic matters of the church. In this chapter we come to another intrinsic matter which is negative&mdash;the intrinsic factor of the winds of teaching for their purpose. The four previous chapters on the positive intrinsic matters of the church may be considered as fellowship related to the &ldquo;day.&rdquo; The fellowship in this chapter may be considered as something related to the &ldquo;night.&rdquo; According to God&rsquo;s creation, there is both day and night; there is morning and evening. We need the day and we also need the night. During the night, there are the moon and the stars. The moon typifies the church (S. S. 6:10), and the stars typify the saints (Dan. 12:3; Matt. 5:14; Phil. 2:15). The moon and the stars shine during the night. For our shining, we need the night. Of course, we also need the day, in which Christ shines as the sun (Mal. 4:2; Luke 1:78-79). Christ shines in the day, but He is reflected in the night by the moon, the church, and He shines in the night through the stars, the saints. In the night the church and the saints are shining. In this chapter we will fellowship about something in the &ldquo;night,&rdquo; but this fellowship will be under the shining light of the church and of the saints, the moon and the stars.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE INTRINSIC FACTOR OF THE WINDS OF TEACHING</h2>
<p>Now that we have seen the intrinsic essence, intrinsic growth, intrinsic building up, and intrinsic fellowship of the church, we need to see the intrinsic factor of the winds of teaching for their purpose. An intrinsic factor is a hidden factor. It is a factor that is not apparent. To see this intrinsic factor, we need a proper and sharp understanding that can penetrate into the whole situation. Every wind of teaching apparently is very good. If it were not good in appearance, nobody would accept it. However, within the winds of teaching, intrinsically, is something different that is not good.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:14 says, &ldquo;That we may be no longer babes tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error.&rdquo; &ldquo;In the sleight of men&rdquo; is in apposition to &ldquo;in craftiness,&rdquo; which is &ldquo;with a view to a system of error.&rdquo; The sleight in this verse is of men, and the system of error is of Satan. Man has the sleight, the craftiness, but man is not able to have a system in this universe. Satan is the one who is able to have a system of error. Man&rsquo;s sleight, man&rsquo;s craftiness, is related to the satanic system of error.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:14 may be considered as the conclusion of the history of Christianity. Christianity is full of the sleight, the craftiness, of men. The word for &ldquo;sleight&rdquo; in Greek signifies the cheating of dice players. A crafty gambler knows how to play dice in order to cheat his opponent. The sleight of men is a cheating method. This method of cheating is crafty, so it becomes craftiness. The sleight of men implies the cheating and deception of men. The history of Christianity shows us that there can be cheating and deception in a so-called Christian teaching.</p>
