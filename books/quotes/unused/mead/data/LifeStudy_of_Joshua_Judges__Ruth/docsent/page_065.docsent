   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BECOMING A CRUCIAL ANCESTOR</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN THE GENEALOGY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>TO BRING IN THE ROYAL HOUSE OF DAVID</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>FOR THE PRODUCING OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Another aspect of Ruth s reward is that she became a crucial ancestor in the genealogy to bring in the royal house of David for the producing of Christ Ruth 4:13b-22; Matt 1:5-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This indicates that she had an all-inclusive and all-extensive gain with the position and capacity to bring Christ into the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>She is thus a great link in the chain that is bringing Christ to every corner of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We all are indebted to Ruth, for without her Christ could not have reached us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But wherever we may be on earth, Christ has reached us through Ruth</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The burden of this ministry is to produce Christ in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that the goal of this ministry is not to teach you to be humble or merely to glorify God in your behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Rather, the goal of this ministry is to inject you with Christ, to impart Christ as an antibiotic to you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more we receive such an injection, the more we will be able to sing, Christ liveth in me, / Christ liveth in me; / Oh! what a salvation this, / That Christ liveth in me Hymns, #507 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the one hand, this injection of Christ will kill our old man; on the other hand, it will make us producers of Christ, those who minister Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>TO CONTINUE THE LINE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>OF THE GOD-CREATED HUMANITY</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>FOR THE INCARNATION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Ruth not only became a crucial ancestor in the genealogy for the producing of Christ, but she also continued the line of the God-created humanity for the incarnation of Christ Matt 1:5-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The incarnation of Christ was a matter of His being brought out of eternity into time with His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In a practical way, this needs to take place in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every day of our Christian life should be a continuation of Christ s incarnation, with Christ being brought forth in order to be born into others through our ministering Christ to them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In order for this to happen, we all need to speak for Christ, to speak forth Christ, and even speak Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Ministering Christ in this way will surely change us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>V. FIRST SAMUEL TO MALACHI</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>BEING A LONG RECORD OF THE GENERATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>FOR THE PROLONGED LINE OF HUMANITY</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>FOR CHRIST S INCARNATION</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First Samuel to Malachi is a long record of the generations for the prolonged line of humanity for Christ s incarnation Matt 1:17 .</S>
