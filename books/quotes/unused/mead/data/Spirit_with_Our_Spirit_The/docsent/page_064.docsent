   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. To Carry Out the Renewing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the Believers as God's New Creation</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit sanctifies us dispositionally to carry out the renewing of the believers as God's new creation Titus 3:5; Rom 12:2b; 2 Cor 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Titus 3:5 speaks of the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The renewing of the Spirit continues the washing of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In other words, renewing is a continuation of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the Spirit sanctifies us, He not only corrects us but also renews us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To renew requires the addition of a new element.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>So the renewing is the continuation of God's new creation work, and renewing is a synonym for sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>C. To Perform the Lord's</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Transformation of the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The dispositional sanctification of the Spirit is to perform the Lord's transformation of the believers 2 Cor 3:18; Rom 12:2b .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Romans 12:2b says that we are to be transformed by renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, renewing is a continuation of regeneration, and transformation is an issue of renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This shows that transformation is also related to sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The dispositional sanctification of the Spirit is carried out by renewing, resulting in transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Both renewing and transformation are parts of the process of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>D. To Consummate in the Believers' Glorification</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1 Thessalonians 5:23, Paul expressed the desire for our whole being to be sanctified, that is, to be brought into glory in full.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How much we are in the glory depends upon how much we have been sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are on the way of being brought into glory by the sanctifying work of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The more we are sanctified, the more we enter into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our being fully sanctified, not only in our spirit but also in our soul and even in our body, means our whole being has been reconstituted with the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our spirit, soul, and body will be reconstituted, sanctified wholly, and that will be our glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sanctification is the gradual process of glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The more we are sanctified, the more we are made holy and the more we feel that we are in the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the Spirit corrects us, He supplies us and transfuses us with all the riches of Christ to sanctify us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then we have the feeling that we are glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, sanctification consummates in the believers' glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>E. To Complete God's Sonship</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>in Choosing the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Finally, the Spirit's dispositional sanctification is to complete God's sonship in choosing the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Ephesians 1:4-5 proves this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Sanctifying is sonizing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sanctification is for God's making of sons.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Sanctification issues in sonship, results in sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The sanctification which we enjoy is not only a change of our position but also a constitution of our disposition to sonize our entire being.</S>
