<p class="bold">WEEK 10 — DAY 5</p><h2 class="uhead1">Matthew 13:45-46</h2><p class="bold">45 &nbsp;Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a merchant seeking fine pearls;</p> <p class="bold">46 &nbsp;And finding one pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he had and bought it.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>The merchant in verse 45 is also Christ, who was seeking the church for His kingdom. After finding it in 16:18 and 18:17, He went to the cross and sold all that He had and bought it for the kingdom.…The pearl [v. 46], produced in the death waters (the world filled with death) by the living oyster (the living Christ), wounded by a little rock (the sinner), and secreting its life-juice around the wounding rock (the believer), is material for the building of the New Jerusalem. Since the pearl comes out of the sea, which signifies the world corrupted by Satan (Isa. 57:20; Rev. 17:15), it must refer to the church, which is constituted mainly of regenerated believers from the Gentile world and which is of great value.</p><p>According to Revelation 21, the New Jerusalem is built with precious stones and pearls. In other words, the New Jerusalem is a combination of the treasure and the pearl. In Matthew 13 these are two, the treasure in the field and the pearl out of the sea. But in Revelation 21…the New Jerusalem is both the kingdom and the church. In Matthew 16 the terms church and kingdom are used interchangeably [see vv. 18-19].…Ultimately, in the New Jerusalem the kingdom and the church become one entity.</p><p>At this point some may be asking the following question: Since the kingdom is the church and the church is the kingdom, what is the difference between them?…As the kingdom, we are something of the earth created by God and redeemed by Christ; and as the church, we are something out of the world corrupted by Satan and condemned by God. The treasure, the symbol of the kingdom, is concealed within the earth.…But the pearl, the symbol of the church,…is something produced out of the sea.</p><p>Among us in the Lord’s recovery there should be no sea [Rev. 21:1]. Instead of the sea, we should have the renewed earth.…If our conversation is filled with talk about worldly things, about money or the movies, it is a sign that we are filled with the things of the Satan-corrupted world. This is the sea. But if among us there is no gossip or criticism, but Christ, the church, and transformation, this is a sign that we are the new earth.…Transformation makes us pearls and precious stone, pearls for the church and precious stones for the kingdom.</p><p>The mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens encompass the main points of Christian history between the Lord’s first coming and His second coming. To interpret these parables properly, we need to take care of the facts of history.…What is there in history that can be regarded as the fulfillment of the treasure and the pearl? As I was considering this matter before the Lord, He showed me that in history…there have been the overcomers, who are more solid, genuine, precious, and valuable in the eyes of God than the wheat. In God’s eyes these overcomers are likened to the treasure hidden in the field and to the pearl out of the sea.…Those who are like this are not just the wheat, bulky in size and abundant in quantity; they are the transformed precious stones, smaller in quantity and hidden under the earth. Not many people can see them, but the Lord sees them.</p><p>Many saints…can testify that…during the years they have been in the recovery, they…are constantly being reduced, transformed, and made more solid.…This is more than a seed sown in a field to produce wheat; it is something that has become precious through the secretion of the life of Christ.…In the Lord’s recovery the quantity is small, but the quality is higher and more solid, because here we have the treasure and the pearl.
