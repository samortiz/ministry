The Recovery of the Unique Oneness<br>of the Body of Christ</H2><P>The third major item of the Lord's recovery is the recovery of the unique oneness of the Body of Christ (John 17:11, 22-23; Eph. 4:3-6). The recovery of the oneness of the Body of Christ is a crucial matter. In Christianity every difference in teaching produces a division. The Southern Baptists boast of their revelation concerning baptism by immersion; thus, they even name themselves according to this revelation. Likewise, the Presbyterian church is proud of their seeing of the presbytery, that is, the ruling of the church by the elders; the Lutherans have denominated themselves according to Luther and his teaching concerning justification by faith; and the Methodists have formed a denomination and named themselves according to Wesley's teaching regarding the method for living a proper life.</P><P>According to Paul's teaching, differences among Christians are unavoidable, but no difference is qualified to be a factor of division. In Romans 14 Paul pointed out that there were differences among the believers, using the matters of eating and the observing of days as examples (vv. 2-6). Although Paul taught that such differences should not be factors of division among the believers, some Christians have used differences to build up divisions as their glory. However, to us this kind of practice is a shame.</P><P>In 1987 some dissenting ones among us began to create divisions. They claim that my ministry has become a system that has subjected under the ministry all the churches built up by the ministry, making them "ministry churches" and no longer genuine local churches. They also say that the emphasis of my ministry has changed, and that this has changed the nature of the Lord's recovery. These dissenters have taken this as an excuse to separate themselves to form a number of divisions. Although I strongly deny these allegations concerning my ministry, even if they were true, it would not justify any division.</P><P>The dissenting ones also said that a local church is not under any kind of apostle. According to them, once the apostles establish elders in a locality, the apostles should keep their hands off the church there. However, Paul did not teach this, nor did he practice this. Paul appointed the elders in Ephesus, and then Paul stayed in Ephesus for three years (Acts 19:1, 8-10; 20:17-20, 27, 31). Similarly, from 1927 to 1952, Brother Nee remained in Shanghai, and the church in Shanghai was under his leading for twenty-five years. Not only so, but in 1948 he established me as an elder in Shanghai. He did not stay away from the church there; rather, in his caring for the church, he appointed me as an elder. The next year, 1949, because of the political situation, Brother Nee sent me out of China to Taiwan.</P><P>According to Paul's Epistles, the oneness of the Body of Christ covers many differences without any division. At the present time in the recovery, we practice baptism by immersion. However, if someone insists on baptizing people by sprinkling, this would not be a justification for anyone to make a division. Suppose that today there is a local church in a particular city that practices the Sabbath. They practice having the Lord's table on the seventh day, on Saturday, instead of on the eighth day, the Lord's Day, which is also the first day of the week. Would you consider them a division? Would you take the Lord's table with them? I would participate in the Lord's table with them. If they were to reject me because my practice is to take the Lord's table on the eighth day instead of on the seventh day, they would be divisive. Likewise, if I were to say that because I take the table on the eighth day, the Lord's Day, I would not take the Lord's table with them on the seventh day, then I would be divisive.</P><P>To say that we overcome the divisive things is easy; to practice this is not easy. According to the New Testament, nothing can qualify as a reason for division. Whether we like certain things in the church life or not, it is not up to our taste. What a marvelous thing it would be if some among us would keep the Sabbath, some would keep the eighth day, some would be sprinkled and some immersed, and some would even follow Mrs. Penn-Lewis, who did not practice water baptism at all but believed only in Spirit baptism. If we could have people with such differences sitting together and saying, "Hallelujah, Praise the Lord," that would be a sign that the genuine oneness is among us. We all need to realize such a recovery of the unique oneness of the Body of Christ.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> </body></html>
