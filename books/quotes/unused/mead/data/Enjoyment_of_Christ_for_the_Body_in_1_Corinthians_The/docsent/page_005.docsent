   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EATING CHRIST AS OUR SPIRITUAL FOOD AND DRINKING HIM AS OUR SPIRITUAL DRINK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Corinthians 10:3 and 4 say, All ate the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Certain hymns in Christianity refer to Christ being the rock mainly as the solid foundation for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, in 1 Corinthians 10 Christ as the rock is not mainly for our redemption but for our drinking and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We all need to eat the same spiritual food and drink the same spiritual drink by drinking of Christ as our rock.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>EATING AND DRINKING THE LORD AT HIS TABLE</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>TO BECOME HIS ONE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In verses 16, 17, and 21 Paul speaks concerning the bread and the cup at the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On His last night with the disciples, the Lord Jesus did not pick up the Scriptures and expound them, saying, This is My teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Keep this in remembrance of Me. In principle, this is the way many in Christianity remember the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rather, the Lord took bread and a cup.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Bread is good only for eating, and a cup is good only for drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord said, This do unto the remembrance of Me 11:24; Luke 22:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By this He was referring to eating the bread and drinking the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The best and unique way to remember the Lord Jesus is not to think, to meditate, or to recall but simply to eat and drink Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The more we eat Jesus at His table, the more He is happy with us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He does not care to see us humble ourselves by kneeling or prostrating ourselves before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord may say, Foolish child, I do not care whether you kneel or not.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I want to see you eat.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The more you eat Me, the happier I am.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The more Christ enters into us, the more we remember Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The best way to remember the Lord Jesus is not to worship and adore Him as the One who is high above in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we remember the Lord in that way, He may say to us, Foolish ones, I am not only there in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I am here in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Simply enjoy Me. The more you eat and drink Me, the happier I am.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I do not want to be above you; I want to be constituted into you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I do not want to be separate from you; I want to be one with you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The more we eat, the more the food is constituted into us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After every Lord s table we can tell the universe, including Satan, Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We love Jesus, and now we have more of Him in us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First Corinthians 10:21 refers to the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord s table is not a desk with a Bible for us to study.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, it is a table with two main courses, the bread for eating and the cup for drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At the Lord s table we feast on the Lord, on His body and on His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This feasting issues in our being constituted to be one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 17 says, Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one Body; for we all partake of the one bread.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The enjoyment of Christ brings forth the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we come together only to exercise our mind, we will eventually stir up disputations in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This will bring in resentment and fighting among us, and we will lose the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Mere doctrinal teachings stir up differing opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even a husband and wife may not be able to agree on certain teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is impossible for us to be one merely by studying the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Instead, the more we eat and drink of Jesus, the more we are one.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The enjoyment of Jesus preserves us in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>BEING POSITIONED IN ONE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>TO DRINK OF ONE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Verse 13 of chapter 12 says that we were all given to drink one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have been positioned to drink the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This position is in the one Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we do not remain in the Body, we will be in the wrong position, and it will be difficult for us to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to keep the proper position by remaining in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the church we are drinking the Lord day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>PARTAKING OF CHRIST AS THE FIRSTFRUITS</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In chapter 15, verse 20 says, Now Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The word fruit implies eating, indicating enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Fresh fruits, such as Washington apples, Florida grapefruit, and California oranges, are all for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit for us to drink and the firstfruits for us to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christ today is not merely a teacher; He is the firstfruits for us to partake of.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Believers have read verse 20 for centuries, but very few have seen that the firstfruits are for eating.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Most believers have considered that the word firstfruits in this verse refers only to Christ as the first One raised from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Although Christ is the first in resurrection, the word firstfruits also indicates that the resurrected Christ is to be eaten by us for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>EATING AND DRINKING PRODUCING TRANSFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All the foregoing points show us the eating and drinking of Jesus in the book of 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Eating and drinking afford us not only the growth in life but also the transformation in life 3:11-12a .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Transformation is not merely an outward correction.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is an inward change in which the supply of Christ as life brings a new element into us and discharges the old element.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We are not only growing; we are also being transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>A few years ago we were muddy clay, but today we can see a certain amount of the element of precious stone within us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We should not be bothered if there is still more mud than stone in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>After a short while, we will be more transformed, and more of the mud will become precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Our transformation into precious stones is for God s building v. 9b . Verses 11 and 12 say, Another foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But if anyone builds upon the foundation gold, silver, precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The foundation has already been laid, and now we can build upon it, not with wood, grass, or stubble but with gold, silver, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Eating affords us the growth in life, growth brings in transformation, and transformation is for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We cannot build up a local church merely by teaching or organizing.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The only way to build up the church is to feed the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We need to feed on Jesus every day.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>By so doing, we will grow, and by growing, we will be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This will cause us to become a solid piece of precious material that is good for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is the reason that for many centuries the subtle enemy, Satan, has hidden the matter of eating and drinking the Lord from God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We praise the Lord that in these last days the Lord is recovering this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He is removing the veils of religion, our old background, our old doctrines, and our old concepts that we may know His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>His way to dispense Himself into us is not by teaching but by our eating and drinking the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>As we saw in the previous message, the mystery and depths of 1 Corinthians are the two spirits, the divine Spirit and the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>These two spirits are for our eating and drinking the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We eat the Lord and drink the divine Spirit in our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Therefore, we all need to apply our human spirit by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>To call on the Lord is to eat and drink of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This is the strategic point in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>A PROMISE OF EATING AND A CALL TO DRINK</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>BEING THE CONCLUSION OF THE ENTIRE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The entire Bible concludes with a promise and a call.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The promise is that those who wash their robes may have the right to eat of the tree of life Rev 22:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The call is in verse 17, which says, The Spirit and the bride say, Come!</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>And let him who hears say, Come!</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>And let him who is thirsty come; let him who wills take the water of life freely.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The promise of eating and the call to drink are the conclusion of the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>From the beginning to the end, the entire Bible reveals the matter of eating and drinking the Lord.</S>
