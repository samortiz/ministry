   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Suppose that a Seventh Day Adventist came to take the Lord's table, and he sat next to you.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Would you be at peace sitting next to a "Sabbath keeper"?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Would you have the same feeling if another brother was sitting next to you?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Probably all of us would feel uneasy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But our feeling and attitude is against Paul's teaching in Romans 14.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Romans 14, Paul tells us we have to receive the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even if their faith is weak, we have to receive them because God has received them vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our receiving of the saints must be based upon God's receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whomever God receives, we have to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Also, we have to receive them in a willing way, and we have to love them with the same love with which we love others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should not have different levels of love.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Let us suppose that we are meeting with ten saints and that two of them are Seventh Day Adventists, three of them are Pentecostal, and the others are somewhat general.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may feel good about the ones who are general but uneasy about the others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This shows that something sectarian exists within us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should have mercy and receive grace and learn the lesson to embrace all the differences among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Otherwise, sooner or later, we will have troubles, and we will miss the very unique and genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There may be talks among us that some are for this and others are for that.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is just like the Corinthians, who were saying, "I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ" 1 Cor 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even the one who said that he was of Christ was divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He said this in the way of excluding other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In order to keep the proper oneness, we have to bury all these kinds of slogans.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some among us may have said, "He is for the new way," or "He is for the old way."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These slogans the new way and the old way should be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not pick up these slogans.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Let us bury and drop all these vain slogans.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have to embrace the differences, but we must try our best to avoid the differences.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All of us have certain peculiarities that make us different.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But once we believe in Jesus and come into the church life, we come in as peculiar members.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may think that we are general and not peculiar, but actually we all have our own peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must be delivered from our peculiar traits for the sake of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we do not know our peculiarity, that may be excusable.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But as long as we are aware of it, we should receive grace to deal with our peculiarity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This saves us from trouble in the church life and helps the building up of the proper oneness in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Romans 14 is a very crucial chapter for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must remember that Romans 12 and Romans 14 go together.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we experience the truth in these two chapters, we can have the church life in the proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we only had Romans 12 without Romans 14, the church life would be annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we only had Romans 14 without Romans 12, the church life would be a formal church without reality.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The reality is in Romans 12, but the practice is in Romans 14.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must practice Romans 14, and then we can have the reality in Romans 12.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to this point, Romans 14 is very, very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When I was a young believer and I met other Christians, I would ask them whether they had been sprinkled or immersed in their baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If they answered that they had been sprinkled, it was difficult for me to embrace them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If a Christian had been immersed, I was happy to embrace him because he and I were the same.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We may be the same as other believers in a matter such as baptism, but if we stay together with them for a long period of time, other differences will arise.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have to be aware of things like this so that we can avoid division in any form.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I have been learning this lesson of keeping oneness in love for many years, and I am still learning.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>During the ten-day trainings that we have in the United States, many of the saints open up their homes to receive other saints who are attending the training.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many of the hosts and guests must admit that ten days together is the limit of their endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>During the first four days of the training, everything may be wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But by the ninth day of the training, the "wonderful" might be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The longer we stay together, the more the problems rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we first began the church life in our locality, everything was wonderful and it seemed easy to keep the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But after remaining in this locality for a number of years, things can rise up within and among us to damage the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should not try to move out of our locality.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Instead we must move our peculiarity out.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If our peculiarity is not moved out of us, our problems will be repeated when we move to another locality.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we insist on keeping our peculiarity, we may be able to function in the church life for eight years.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But if we want to be a member in the church life for fifty years, we need to remove many things out of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then we can enter into the experience of both Romans 12 and Romans 14.</S>
