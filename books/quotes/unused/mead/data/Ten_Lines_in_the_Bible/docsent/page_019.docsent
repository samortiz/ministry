   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is seen in Revelation.</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A CONCLUDING WORD</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the one hand, God s work throughout the ages is to work Himself into man as the tree of life, and on the other hand, to completely eliminate the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which denotes Satan, from the universe by casting it into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Of the two trees in the universe, one is wrought into the New Jerusalem as the tree of life for the building up of the New Jerusalem, and the other one is wrought into the lake of fire as the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the tree of death, to become the center of the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, there are two trees, two spheres, and two destinations.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The tree of life has the New Jerusalem as its sphere and destination; the tree of the knowledge of good and evil has the lake of fire as its sphere and destination.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All persons and things joined to the tree of life throughout the ages will end up in the New Jerusalem; all persons and things joined to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil will end up in the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Life is always with the tree of life; death is always with the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
