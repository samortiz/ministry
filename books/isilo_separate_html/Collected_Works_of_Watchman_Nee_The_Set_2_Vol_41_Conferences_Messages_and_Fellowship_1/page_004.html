Why did Paul mention deliverance from sin, that is, being dead to sin in Romans 6 and then speak about deliverance from the law in chapter seven? Why do we have to be delivered from the law after we are delivered from sin? What is the difference between deliverance from sin and deliverance from the law? What is the relationship between sin and the law? Is there any correlation between deliverance from the law and deliverance from sin?</p><h2 class="head1">TRUE DELIVERANCE FROM SIN ONLY BEING<br />REALIZED THROUGH DELIVERANCE FROM THE LAW</h2><p>Romans 6:14 says that sin will not lord it over us because we are not under the law but under grace. This means that we are first delivered from the law and then from sin. When we are no longer under the law, sin will not lord it over us. Yet many believers turn this around. They only pay attention to the matter of deliverance from sin and overlook the matter of deliverance from the law. Sin and the law are linked to each another. This is analogous to the principle of Chinese medicine. Western medicine deals with a sickness either internally by medication or externally by surgery. But in Chinese medicine there is no such thing as an external treatment, because Chinese medicine only tries to deal with the root of illnesses. It does not independently tackle the outward symptoms of illnesses. Sin is the outward symptom of a sickness, whereas the law is the root of the sickness. Man sins because he is under the law. The law is the cause, while sin is the effect. It is useless for anyone to just deal with the outward effect without first dealing with the root cause.</p><p>Many people have been troubled by the problem of sin for years and have been struggling without any success. They have failed because they have only taken care of the matter of deliverance from sin without understanding the need to be delivered from the law. In Romans 6 Paul told us how we can be delivered from sin. In chapter seven he goes on to say that it is not enough to just be delivered from sin; we must know how to be delivered from the bondage of the law as well. Actually, Romans 6 is the same as Romans 7, and Romans 7 is the same as Romans 6. Chapter seven is necessary because something is left unresolved in chapter six. Romans 7:8 says that "without the law sin is dead." Strictly speaking, without deliverance from the law in chapter seven, there can be no deliverance from sin in chapter six. Only after we are delivered from the law can we be truly delivered from sin.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DEFINITION OF THE LAW</h2><p>We must next ask, "What is the law? What is the definition of the law?" Many people think that being delivered from the law is being freed from the Ten Commandments. Some may think that being delivered from the law is being freed from the ceremonial ordinances of the Old Testament, such as the statutes governing the priestly services. They may also think that being delivered from the law is being freed from moral precepts. Actually, the removal of the letter of the law cannot keep anyone from committing sin. God's demand on man in the entire Old Testament is summed up in the law. The law is God's demand on man. Keeping the law means that God has a demand and that we try to do His will and please Him according to our own effort. This is keeping the law.</p><p>In the New Testament, God has set the law aside and replaced it with grace. God no longer asks man to do anything to please Him. This is a very significant word. Keeping the law is doing something to please God, whereas being delivered from the law is no longer doing anything to please God. God has no intention for us to do anything by ourselves to please Him. If we cannot get through on this point, we cannot get through on the matter of sin.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> </body></html>
