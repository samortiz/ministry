THE CROSS AFTER RESURRECTION<br>AND THE MAIDEN'S FAILURE<br>(5:2&#151;6:3)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Calling (5:2)</H2><P>Song of Songs 5:2 says, "I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night." By this time, her own work and life have ceased. She is like one who is asleep; there is no further activity, work, endeavoring, struggle, effort, or anxiety. She is perfectly at rest. The cross has not only dealt with all her sins, but has dealt with all her flesh. Sin is no longer active, and the self is no longer active. The whole outward man has been brought to a state of cessation. Even when she does something, she does not feel that she is doing it herself; she feels that she is a bystander. Indeed, she is asleep. But this does not mean that she is completely motionless, thoughtless, void of belief and activity, and void of work and living. The resurrection life of the Lord is in her, and the resurrected Lord Himself is dwelling and living within her through the Holy Spirit. Although the outward man is silent, the inward man is active. Here we see a complete separation between the outward man and the inward man. Outwardly we can be asleep, but inwardly we are awake and are not sleepy at all. This matches Paul's word, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me" (Gal. 2:20). This is the expression of perfect fellowship with Christ. A person who is perfectly one with the Lord is very quick, alert, and full of feelings. He can feel even the slightest voice or movement of the Lord. The inner man never sleeps. Whenever the Lord speaks, the maiden immediately hears, and she immediately identifies the voice of her beloved.</P><P>What does the Lord do now? He "knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister." In this book, the Lord first revealed Himself as the King because He is after the throne in our heart. Then He was a caller, leading the maiden out of the inner walls into the resurrection life. Finally, He reveals Himself as the Bridegroom, having a perfect love relationship with the maiden. Now a completely different revelation is unveiled: "My head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night." What kind of picture is this? This is clearly His experience at Gethsemane. There His head was indeed filled with dew! That night His head was filled with the drops of the night (Luke 22:44)! Here He reveals Himself as a son of sorrows.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_042.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_044.html">Next</a> </body></html>
