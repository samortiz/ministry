   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTION THIRTY-EIGHT CONCERNING LUKE 16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the story of the rich man and Lazarus in Luke 16, was the rich man's perdition a result of enjoying good things in his lifetime?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Was Lazarus' salvation a result of suffering evil things in his lifetime, or were there other reasons?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>ANSWER</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some say that the rich man's perdition was a result of enjoying good things in his lifetime and that Lazarus' salvation was a result of suffering in his lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They say this because of the words which were spoken by Abraham to the rich man Luke 16:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But is this really the case?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In verse 25 Abraham was comparing the differences between these two before and after their death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Abraham did not come to the basic reason for their perdition and salvation until verse 29, which says, "But Abraham said, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From this we can see that the rich man's perdition was due to not obeying the words of Moses and the prophets, whereas Lazarus' salvation was a result of heeding the words of Moses and the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What are the words of Moses and the prophets?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After the Lord Jesus resurrected, He was walking with the two disciples who were on their way to Emmaus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, He explained to them clearly in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself" Luke 24:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verses 44-46 also say, "And He said to them, These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all the things written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and Psalms concerning Me must be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then He opened their mind to understand the Scriptures; and He said to them, Thus it is written, that the Christ would suffer and rise up from the dead on the third day."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The words of Moses and the prophets were the words spoken by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In other words, the rich man perished because he had rejected the Savior who died and rose for him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Lazarus was saved because he received the Savior who died and rose for him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God has given us the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since we can believe the words of the Scripture, He will not send a man from the dead to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God has been hiding Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He does it most marvelously.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God has been hiding Himself to the extent that man thinks that there is no God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even though man commits sin and evil, God does not punish him by instantly striking him to death with thunder and lightning.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even if man blasphemes God, He still does not instantly punish him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God does not arrange all the stars in the heavens into words that explicitly tell man that he has sinned, thereby proving that there is a God in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today God does not use spectacular ways to express Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He simply wants man to believe His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"But he Abraham said to him, If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if someone rises from the dead" Luke 16:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is a revelation from God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This revelation tells us that if people do not believe the words of Moses and the prophets, it would be futile even if someone were raised from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, if people do not accept the testimony of the Bible, they will not believe even if someone rises from the dead.</S>
