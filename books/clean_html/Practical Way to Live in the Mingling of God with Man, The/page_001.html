<h2 class="head2">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee at a conference in Reseda and Los Angeles, California, February 12-17, 1963. The conference consisted of six meetings; however, no record exists for Message Three. Consequently, this book contains only five chapters. These messages have not been reviewed by the speaker.</p>
