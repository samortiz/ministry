<h1 class="title">BEARING FRUIT AS BRANCHES OF THE VINE AND <br />
TRADING WITH OUR TALENT<br />
AS FAITHFUL SLAVES</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 15:1-2, 6; Matt. 25:24-29; Prov. 11:25; 2 Cor. 12:15; 1 Cor. 9:22</h1>
<p>In the foregoing chapters we saw four main points concerning our service. First, in doing things, we need life and skill. Life depends upon growth; we have the divine life within us, and this life is growing. Skill, however, depends upon training. Since the church meetings care mainly for the growth of life, we also need the training to care for our skill. Training is not for mere teaching but for dealing with ourselves without excuses. We should not be merciful to ourselves in the way of making excuses. To be trained is to become like a sacrifice on the altar. The priests showed no mercy in cutting the sacrifices. Any mercy would have spoiled the sacrifices. We need a strict training. All the ones who rendered help to me in my youth were strict. At that time I did not appreciate them very much, but today I am very grateful to them.</p>
<p>The second point we saw is that because the church is an organism that needs life in every aspect, merely to do business and carry out affairs in a good way is not adequate. Therefore, the church service is always for ministering life to others. Third, in order to minister life to others, we must pick up a burden to care for unbelievers, young believers, new believers, and weaker believers. If we do not contact people, we cannot minister life to them. Just as doctors need to have patients, we also need people to care for. It is impossible to minister life to others if we are always by ourselves. We need some persons to be under our care, either unbelievers under the care of the gospel for salvation or new, young, or weaker believers under our ministering of life for their growth in life. We need to pick up the burden to care for people.</p>
<p>Without a proper love for others, our care for them is not genuine. A proper mother cares for her children day and night. Even in her dreams, she is still caring for them. No mother would be burdened to care for her children simply because they are attractive or so that when she is old, they can take care of her. This kind of love is a political love, a love with a purpose. A mother loves her children simply because they are of her own blood. To come to someone out of a motive to accomplish something is the way of a politician. The proper way is to receive a burden for someone from the Lord in prayer and then to go to contact him, regardless of the outcome for us. After receiving a burden for some persons in a specific way, it is not effective to immediately begin to pray with them. First, we ourselves need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, You have given me a burden for these brothers. Now I come to You to discharge my burden. You put the burden upon my shoulders, and now I am returning the burden to You.&rdquo; We need to pray through until we are assured that the Lord has answered our prayer for those brothers. We should have not merely a short, general prayer but a prayer from every angle. As we pray thoroughly, we should have the assurance that the Lord has given this burden to us and that we have returned the burden to the Lord. Then the Lord may say, &ldquo;I am happy to receive this burden from your hand. Now you must stand with Me. We two&mdash;you and I, I and you&mdash;will be one. Then I will tell you the time and the right way to contact them.&rdquo; After this, the Lord will bring to us each one He has burdened us for. One may come the next evening, and on the following days others may come. In this way we will see that the Lord answers our prayer.</p>
<p>The fourth matter we have seen is that in order to minister life to others, we need to be dealt with thoroughly by the Lord. The reason we do not care for anyone is that we are too &ldquo;raw&rdquo;; we have not been dealt with adequately by the Lord. Almost no fallen human being was born with an interest in others. Everyone was born with an interest only in himself. However, we have been reborn, and this new birth is one that produces an interest in others. Still, we may neglect the interest that is in us by the new birth. Therefore, we need a thorough dealing, which will eventually come to the matter of our disposition. It is due to our disposition that we have no interest in others, or even if we do have an interest in others, we are unable to minister life to them. We may present people with a &ldquo;loaf of bread,&rdquo; but within it is the &ldquo;stone&rdquo; of our strong disposition. If we are peculiar, it is difficult for people to receive something from us. Therefore, we must go to the Lord to be enlightened. We must not say that we have not received any light. The light is here all the time. We simply need to exercise our sight to receive it and deal with what we see. Then by dealing with what we see, we will receive more light.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SERVICE IN THE CHURCH<br />
BEING IN GENUINE FELLOWSHIP<br />
AS THE FLOW AND IMPARTING OF LIFE</h2>
<p>As those who have been born again, we have the divine life. However, we may not exercise the divine life much in the church service. We may simply do things and talk, gossip, ask questions, and exercise our mind and emotions in the name of &ldquo;fellowship,&rdquo; yet without the exercise of the divine life in us. To come together to have a friendly talk without the ministry of life is not fellowship; it is merely something social. Genuine fellowship is the flow and the mutual imparting of life. I minister life to you, and you return life to me, and in this life current there is the real fellowship. In our service groups if we care only for business affairs without much imparting of life, that is not the genuine church service. That is simply a kind of social service. Everything in the church must be in the nature of life, with the content of life, and in the imparting of life. The &ldquo;currency&rdquo; in the church &ldquo;exchange&rdquo; is not dollars but the divine life; the divine life is our only kind of &ldquo;merchandise.&rdquo; The church is altogether a matter of life. Our work, speaking, fellowship, service, ministry, message, Bible study, and prayer must be in the flow and imparting of life.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Normal Way of Fruit-bearing and Shepherding for the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
