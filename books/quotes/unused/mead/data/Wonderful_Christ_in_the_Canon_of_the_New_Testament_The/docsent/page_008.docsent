   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD BECOMING FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God John 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But this is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is wonderful, but we should not stop here.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must go on to John 1:14.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>. The Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that God became something else.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was God, but at a certain time He became something else.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Have you ever considered that God became something else?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our God today is no longer merely God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If some Jewish friends were here, I would tell them that they lack something.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They only have God, but we have God become flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The term flesh in our thinking is not good.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But here in John 1:14, the word flesh is really glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God, and the Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That means that God became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is only by His becoming flesh that He could tabernacle among man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>FULL OF GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When God became flesh and tabernacled among man, He came full of something.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He did not come full of teachings and doctrines, regulations and forms.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Neither did He come full of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No, God became flesh and tabernacled among us full of grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is grace?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some Christians think that if we have a good car, that is really God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then they give a testimony thanking the Lord for His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Others think that a good wife or a good family is God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But that is not grace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Grace is God Himself given to us freely for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But for God to give Himself to us is not so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It does not mean that one day God came down from heaven and said to man, I give Myself to you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If He were to do that, we would be extremely fearful, and we would dare not contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His glory would consume us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But, praise the Lord, all His burning glory was concealed in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He came to us in exactly the same form as we are.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>And He came to us in this way to such an extent that it was difficult to recognize or discern that He was God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is why the Pharisees had such a problem with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They wondered how He could be God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Was He not a poor man from Nazareth?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Did they not know His mother, His brothers, and His sisters?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He was a poor man, from a poor country, from a little town called Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How could He be God?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But He was God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was the Word become flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He was God in such a humble human form.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is for this reason that Isaiah 9:6 is such a precious verse to us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulders: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The eternal Father, The Prince of Peace.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A child is born unto us, but His name is not called a wonderful man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>His name is called The Mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>And a son is given to us, and His name is called The Eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Is He the Son or the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Is He the child or the mighty God?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Now we are clear.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He is both a child and the mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He is both the Son and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>That little child born in a manger at Bethlehem was the Mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Jewish people believe in God, but they do not believe that child born in a manger at Bethlehem was God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But we believe!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>That little child was God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He was not God in divine form, but He was God taking a human form.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>His purpose in doing this was that He might be sown into mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He took man as the soil to produce something for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Hence, the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace enjoyment and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He came full of the riches of divinity for us to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is grace.</S>
