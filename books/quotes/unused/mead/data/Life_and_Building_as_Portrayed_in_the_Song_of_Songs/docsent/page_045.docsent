   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NO PERSONALITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Then she came out of her spiritual wilderness, which was just her will.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>She came out like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense and all the powders of the merchant.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the foregoing pictures, she had some kind of personality, but now as pillars she has no personality.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>She was dealt with by the Lord to such an extent that her personality was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In our spiritual life, the problem is always with our personality.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every person has a strong personality.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Dealing with things is no problem, because things have no personality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But dealing with people is always a problem because of the differences in personality.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord must deal with our personality because it conflicts with His.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the last four figures of the first group, however, there was no personality.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The seeking one had come out of her will, and her personality had been thoroughly dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There was no personality in the pillars, the couch, the palanquin, or the crown.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eight figures constitute the first group: the horses, the doves' eyes, the lily, the dove, the pillars, the couch, the palanquin, and the crown.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Between the first four figures, many things occur.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The appreciation and the enjoyment of the Lord Jesus cause transformation from one figure to the next.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But between the last four figures nothing seems to be taking place.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The pillars, the couch, the palanquin, and the crown all seem to be alike.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once we attain to the stage of losing our personality, we will be all four of these figures at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Who then is our personality?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We can see this clearly in the figure of the palanquin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The palanquin itself has no personality, but within the palanquin, there is a person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This person is the personality of the palanquin.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His will is the palanquin's will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His emotion is the palanquin's emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His mind is the palanquin's mind.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The palanquin itself does not have any personality, but it contains the living person of the King within it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These figures speak more to us than a number of messages on how to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we simply look at these pictures, we are clear.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we come out of the wilderness of our will, we become the pillars, the couch, the palanquin, and the crown.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We become the Lord's boast and glory, and He becomes our full and complete personality.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the beginning, the seeking one's emotion was touched by the Lord 1:2-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then gradually, her mind was renewed 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Eventually, her will was subdued 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Her whole being was transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>She became so one with the Lord within that she became the outward expression of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This was seen in both the palanquin and the crown.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord was in the palanquin, and He was under the crown.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, she was described as being Solomon with the crown.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The two became one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This was really the highest attainment of spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THREE MAIN TURNS</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But that is only the first half of the book, showing only the first half of the poetic portrayal of our spiritual experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At that point she still needed the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This means that even with such a high attainment, her day had not yet broken; some shadows still existed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>She was not content with what she had attained.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>She realized that she needed more of the Lord's death and resurrection; she must stay there.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>By staying at the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense, she was transferred to the mountaintop of Lebanon, which is the mountaintop of the Lord's ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is always true whenever we experience the Lord's death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To be transformed into the palanquin and the crown is a high attainment, yet the peak of the mountaintop of the Lord's ascension is even higher.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But then the Lord came to call her to the next turn.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The first turn was mostly made by herself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>She realized that she needed the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense, and the second turn was made by the experience of the Lord's death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then the Lord came to help her make the third turn.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He called her to leave her highest attainment, to leave the mountaintop of Lebanon and to go down to the valley to be a garden.</S>
