He states that the central thought of the Scriptures is that God intends to work Himself in Christ through the Spirit into us, that God and we, we and God, might be really one in life, in nature, and in the Spirit. Second Corinthians is the deepest book in the Bible to experientially unveil this intention. It is a book which is mostly on the subjective enjoyment and experience of Christ rather than doctrine.</p><p>Brother Lee also points out that 2 Corinthians may be considered as an autobiography of the Apostle Paul. If anyone is going to know what kind of a person Paul was, he must come to this book. In it we see a portrait of a person who lived in the spirit. For us to enjoy and experience Christ in a rich way we must be persons in the spirit as symbolized by ten aspects in 2 Corinthiansâ€”captives, letters, mirrors, vessels, ambassadors, co-workers, a temple, a virgin, lovers of the church, and tasters of Christ. It is by all these aspects that we can be thoroughly wrought by God and with God and be constituted the ministers of the new covenant for the building up of the church. It is our hope that the reader would pray much to be brought into the subjective reality of the riches of Christ as revealed in 2 Corinthians.</p></td></tr></table></div>
