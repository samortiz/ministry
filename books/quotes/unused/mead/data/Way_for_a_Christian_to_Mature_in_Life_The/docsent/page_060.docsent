   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE WAY FOR A CHRISTIAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO MATURE IN LIFE EXPERIENCING THE WORK OF GOLD, SILVER, AND PRECIOUS STONES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Second Corinthians 3:18 says, But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to this verse we are being transformed into the same image as the Lord by the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Revelation 4:2b-3a says, Upon the throne there was One sitting; and He who was sitting was like a jasper stone and a sardius in appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It says here that the Lord on the throne was like a jasper stone and a sardius in appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Revelation 21:11b says, Her light was like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, as clear as crystal.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This refers to glory.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First Corinthians 3:12 says, But if anyone builds upon the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Gold is first, then silver, and lastly precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE TWO ASPECTS OF GOD S WORK</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>FOR OUR MATURITY IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God s work in us is to make us mature in life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God begins His work of making us mature by working His life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From then on, God unceasingly works in us so that He can work His life out from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When He has worked His life out from within us, we will have reached maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When God puts His life into us, He is mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When He works His life out from within us, we are mingled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When He comes to mingle with us, this is the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we mingle with Him in the Holy Spirit, this is the principle of death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE PRINCIPLES OF INCARNATION AND</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>DEATH AND RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every person who has been saved experienced the first aspect of God s work at the time that he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The principle of incarnation is God s entering into us and mingling with us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is what transpired at the time when we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What God is doing in us now is the second aspect of His work the principle of death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This aspect causes us to be worked into God and mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When this second aspect is completed, we will be mature in His life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At that time we will express His image and be conformed to His image.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we express His image, spontaneously we also will express His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Image and glory are actually one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>GLORY BEING THE SPIRIT SPREADING OUT</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>FROM WITHIN MAN</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The result of being transformed into the Lord s image is that the Lord is expressed from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the work of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the time of our salvation, the Spirit entered into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>From that time on, the Spirit desires to spread out from our spirit into every part of our being our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the Spirit is able to do this, our mind, preferences, and opinions will have the element of the Spirit and will bear traces of the work of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then, whenever someone comes in contact with us, they will sense the flavor of the Spirit in all of our thoughts, preferences, choices, decisions, and opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is because the Spirit has expanded and spread out from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Spirit who has expanded and spread out from within us is our glory.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we allow the Spirit to do this, others will sense glory with us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They will also feel that we are noble and different.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Sometimes we may come in contact with a particular saint whom we know is saved but whose speaking, conduct, thoughts, and sentiments cause us to feel that he is a person who is base and dishonorable.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Why is this?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is because he has not allowed the Spirit to spread out from within him to all the parts of his being.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On the other hand, sometimes we may contact a saint who does not have a high status in the world but who gives us the sense that he is noble, honorable, weighty, and bright.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although we may be more educated, have more learning, be of a higher status in the world, and be more capable and wealthy than he, we have the sense that we are lower than he is.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This sense proves that this person has the glory of God with him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This glory is the Spirit of God being expressed from within him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, when people contact him, it is like they are contacting the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When people are with him, they feel that they have the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is because this person has the Lord s image.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>His speaking, opinions, feelings, and moods all have the image of the Lord, because the Lord is being expressed from within him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The glory and image that we sense are the expression of the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Lord Himself 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thus, the Lord as the Spirit is manifested from within him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is a mature person.</S>
