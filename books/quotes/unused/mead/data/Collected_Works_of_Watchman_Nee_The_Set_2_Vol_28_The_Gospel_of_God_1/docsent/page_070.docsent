   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BELIEVING IN THE LORD'S DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The only condition for God's salvation is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Faith is saying that you are willing and that you want it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What is the faith that the Bible talks about?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, God has accomplished redemption by the death of His Son Jesus Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His work on the cross has been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Why has it been completed?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I do not know why.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Neither do you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only God knows why.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How can the blood of the Lord Jesus redeem us from our sins?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why is the Lord's redemption effective?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We do not need to ask these questions.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These are matters for God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord's work on the cross has been accomplished, and God's heart is satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The cross of the Lord Jesus is not for satisfying our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is for satisfying God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Does the settlement of a debt satisfy the heart of the creditor or the heart of the debtor?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If God feels that something is sufficient for Him, we also should feel that it is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If He says that the Lord's work is able to redeem us from sin, it is surely able to redeem us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whether or not you think that the work is sufficient is irrelevant.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What matters is that God thinks that the work is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is not just a matter of whether or not the money has been paid.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What matters is whether or not the creditor considers the money paid.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If the money you pay satisfies his heart, you will have no problems.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I wish I could repeat this a hundred times.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The work of the Lord Jesus is not to satisfy our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The work of the Lord is first for the satisfaction of God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is God who demands the judgment on sins.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is God who requires that sins be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is God who said that without the blood there is no remission of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If God were unconcerned, the blood would be unnecessary.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The blood is there because God is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If God were unconcerned, the cross would be unnecessary.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is the need of the cross because God is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord has accomplished all the work on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, God raised Him from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The resurrection of the Lord Jesus is the proof that God is satisfied with the Lord's work on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although we do not understand how the cross has satisfied God's heart, we know that Jesus of Nazareth has risen from the grave.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Was it the death of Jesus of Nazareth that the apostles went all over the world to preach?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Have you heard such a gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I have never heard such a gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They went all over the world only to tell others that Jesus of Nazareth has been resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you read the book of Acts, you will see that the apostles did not preach the death of Jesus for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What they told people everywhere is that this man had resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They preached this because the fact of the Lord's resurrection proves that His death has glorified God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord Jesus was resurrected because His work had been accepted before God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His redemption is complete, and we can now be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If the Lord's work had not been completed, He would have been left in the grave.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, resurrection is nothing other than the Lord Jesus satisfying God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord Jesus has resurrected from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The apostles preach this to us as a proof for our faith, calling us to believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>On the one hand, salvation has to do with the Lord's death.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On the other hand, it has to do with the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>His death is for the settlement of our debt and the forgiveness of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>By this death the problem of our sins is solved.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>His resurrection is the proof that His work of death has satisfied God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God considers His work right and proper.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I have used an illustration before, which I will use again for the sake of the many new ones with us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If I have sinned, I should go to jail.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But suppose a friend of mine volunteers to go in my place.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Because he goes to jail, I am released.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But it is not until he is released that I know my case is settled.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Only then will my heart be relieved.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>My body is released because his is imprisoned.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But my heart is released only when he comes out.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Until the case is over, he will still be inside.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If he is still in jail, I will not know if he has borne my punishment or if I will still be wanted.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When he is out of prison, I will know that the case is settled.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the same way, as soon as the Lord Jesus died, the problem of my sin was solved.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But the Lord Jesus had to resurrect before I could know that the problem of sin was solved.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He was delivered for our transgressions and was resurrected for our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He resurrected because the problem of our justification was solved.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We can go to the world to tell everyone of the work God has accomplished through the death of His Son Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>At the same time, we can tell others that through the resurrection of the Lord, God has given us a receipt and a proof.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It informs us that the task is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Today we do not merely believe in the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Rather, we believe also in the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Can you find one verse in the Bible that tells man to believe in the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is very strange that we are always told to believe in the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If you meet a nominal Christian today who may have been a member of a church for ten, twenty, or thirty years and talk with him a little, you will realize that there is a big difference between believing in the cross and believing in the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I met a member of a denomination once who had been an elder for thirty-eight years and a "Christian" for fifty or sixty years.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When I asked if he believed in the Lord Jesus, he said, "Yes."</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But when I asked if he knew that his sins were forgiven, he dared not say yes.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Then I asked him if Jesus was his Savior, and he said, "Yes."</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But when I asked him if he was saved, he said that he did not know.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When I asked him if he believed that the Lord Jesus had been judged on the cross for our sins, he readily said that he did.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Not only does the Bible say this, even our hymn book says it.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>It says that thousands of bulls and goats on the Jewish altar will not forgive us of our sins, but the one sacrifice of the Lord cleanses us from all sin.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>When I asked this man if he were cleansed from his sins, he said he believed that the crucifixion of the Lord was for his sins, but he dared not say that his sins were washed away.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>I cannot blame him for being unclear.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>It is true that the Lord Jesus died on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>But how can one know that this cross counts?</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>He believes in the cross, but how does he know that the cross has solved all his problems and settled his case?</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Although the settlement for sin happened on the cross, what makes us clear is the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If you repay someone some money, how do you know that the amount paid is sufficient and that the bank notes are genuine?</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>What if the notes are counterfeit?</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Only one thing will assure you that the amount has been fully paid a receipt from your creditor saying that the amount has been paid in full.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>When you pay the money, the creditor clears your account, and you know that the matter is settled.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>In the same way, the death of the Lord Jesus speaks of what He has done for God, while His resurrection speaks of what God has done for us.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Death is the settlement between Him and God, but resurrection is the announcement to us of the settlement between God and His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>God said that the debt has been cleared.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If you believe that the Lord's death is for your sins, the Lord's resurrection will then declare that your sin record has been cleared.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Many people say that we have to settle our sin account, and that if it is not settled, we cannot be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Thank the Lord that my sin account was settled before I was even born.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Even the receipt was issued.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The death of the Lord Jesus was the settlement of the debt, and the resurrection of the Lord Jesus was the proof of this settlement.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Resurrection is the proof of justification.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We are justified because God has been gracious to us and has redeemed us from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>The death of the Lord Jesus was for the solution of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>The resurrection of the Lord Jesus was for the proof of justification.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Hence, our faith rests on the resurrection of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>This is not all that resurrection accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>If we think that it is, we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>This is only the objective aspect of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>There is still the subjective aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Objectively speaking, the resurrection of the Lord becomes the proof of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>If anyone were to ask me how I know that I am saved, I would tell him that I have the proof.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>This proof proves that I am saved.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>You may tell me that you were saved on a certain date in a certain year because that was when you received the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>I would then ask how you could know that was sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>You may say that you confessed your sins that day, but how do you know that confession is sufficient?</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>You may say that you cried for your sins that day, but how do you know that your tears will wash your sins away?</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>You may say that you have repented, confessed your sins, and accepted the Lord Jesus, but how do you know that this repentance, confession, and receiving of the Lord is sufficient?</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>If you asked me, I would answer that I am actually saved because of the Lord's death, but I know that I am saved because of the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>My friends, you have to differentiate between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>I am saved because of the Lord's death, but I have the assurance and clear knowledge that I am saved because of the Lord's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>When I pay the money, I settle my debt.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>I know that I have settled the debt because I have a receipt.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Thank God that He has given us a proof and a receipt.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>His Son has paid the debt for all our sins on the cross, and through the resurrection of His Son, He has informed us that the matter is fully settled.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Hence, all of the Lord's work is now finished.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>If there is anyone here tonight who still doubts that he is saved, I only need to ask him what he has believed in and what he has received.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>It is not sufficient for a person just to believe in the cross and to receive the redemption of the Lord on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>One must also believe in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>The resurrection of the Lord Jesus is God's message to us.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>It shows us that God has accepted the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>Thank God that the cross has satisfied God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>That is why there is the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>Thus, the foundation of our faith is the death of Christ, but our faith is also based on the proof of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>Death is His work of redeeming us.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>Resurrection is the proof of His having redeemed us.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>Notice that here I have said "having redeemed."</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>Death is His work of redeeming us, and resurrection is the proof of His having redeemed us.</S>
