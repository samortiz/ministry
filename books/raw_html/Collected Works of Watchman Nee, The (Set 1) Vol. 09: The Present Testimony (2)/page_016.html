<H1 CLASS=TITLE>JEHOVAH</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 21</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Exo. 3:13-18</H1><P>There are many precious portions in the Bible. This morning God has given me light from this portion of the word and has nourished me. I would like, therefore, to share with you what I have received.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD AND JEHOVAH</H2><P>One thing that we should notice in the Bible is that God's name is not used carelessly. Every time God mentions His name, it is with a purpose. Every time God uses His name, it is not used carelessly. Even the name Jesus is very meaningful and is not used haphazardly. For example, there is Jesus Christ, there is Christ Jesus, and there is the Lord Jesus Christ, etc. If we change Jesus Christ to Christ Jesus, we will be wrong doctrinally. The same is true of the name which God reveals to man. In Exodus 3:13-18 God purposely points out that besides being God, His name is Jehovah. This reveals His relationship with Israel. What is the difference between God and Jehovah? Let us first consider how God revealed Himself through His name in Genesis. From this we can find out the meaning of His names. From Genesis to Exodus 3, God used different names to reveal Himself. He used at least three names to reveal himself. In Genesis 1 He uses the name God. In Genesis 2 He uses a different name— not God, but Jehovah God. Why does Genesis 1 use God while Genesis 2 uses Jehovah God? The amazing thing is that God did not tell man the meaning of the name Jehovah. Although Abraham knew the name (because God told him once that His name was Jehovah), he never knew the meaning of the name. Not until Exodus 3:14-15 did God begin to tell man the meaning of the name Jehovah.</P><P>Why does Genesis 1 not mention Jehovah or Jehovah God, but only God? The name God—Elohim—means the strong and mighty One. The name God has to do with the creatures; it refers to His relationship with the creation. But Jehovah is a name that is related to man. Genesis 2 speaks of the relationship between God and man. Therefore, Jehovah God is mentioned right away. This speaks of God's relationship with man. In Genesis 1 we do not see man. Even when the creation of man is mentioned on the sixth day, the emphasis is still on creation. This is why the name God is used. In Genesis 2 we see man, and so it speaks of Jehovah God. Every time the word Jehovah God is used, it denotes God having a relationship with man. Every time the word God is used, it implies His power and His relationship with the creation. Let us now consider a few portions of the Word to show the difference between God and Jehovah.</P><P>"And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: and the Lord [i.e. Jehovah] shut him in" (Gen. 7:16). Can you see the difference here? All those that went in the ark went in male and female, as God had commanded, and Jehovah shut Noah in the ark. Can we change it around? No, we cannot. It was God who commanded. A command has to do with God's authority. Therefore, the name God is used here. But after man came, Jehovah rather than God shut him in. This is because shutting in has to do with God's care. This shows a difference in usage between God and Jehovah.</P><P>"This day will the Lord [i.e. Jehovah] deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel" (1 Sam. 17:46). Here it says that Jehovah would "deliver thee into mine hand," for the purpose that "all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel." Does it say that "God will deliver thee into mine hand...that all the earth will know that there is a Jehovah?" No! The reason is that Jehovah is related to us; He cares for us and delivers the enemy into our hand. Moreover, God does not tell all the earth, those outside Israel, that He is Jehovah; He only shows them that He is God. Jehovah speaks of a relationship with those who are close to God, while God speaks of a relationship with ordinary men, in which He reveals His power to men.</P><P>"And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the Lord [Jehovah] helped him; and God moved them to depart from him" (2 Chron. 18:31). The One who helped Jehoshaphat was Jehovah, while the One who moved his enemy was God. Jehovah helped Jehoshaphat because he was close to God and intimate with God. God used the title God to Jehoshaphat's enemy because they had no relationship with Him. This is another example.</P><P>God is the common name, while Jehovah is the name of intimacy. God refers to His power, while Jehovah refers to His love. God refers to creation, while Jehovah refers to His intimacy. Genesis 1 does not mention Jehovah because it covers the creation. Even when chapter one mentions man, it is in relation to creation and power. Genesis 2 speaks of God's intimacy with man and His relationship with man; therefore, it mentions Jehovah God. Why does it say Jehovah God in chapter two, instead of just Jehovah? This proves that the Jehovah in chapter two is the God in chapter one. Jehovah God is not only the One who is powerful, but is also the One who draws near to man. However, even though the name Jehovah is used from Genesis 2 until Exodus 3, the meaning of the name Jehovah is not explained until Exodus 3:14.</P>
