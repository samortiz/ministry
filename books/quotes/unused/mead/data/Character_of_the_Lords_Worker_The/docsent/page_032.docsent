   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Look at the apostles in the New Testament, from Peter to Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Can we find one lazy bone in them?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They did not have any trace of laziness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They had no thought of wasting their time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All of them labored diligently and sought for every opportunity to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul said, "Proclaim the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and teaching" 2 Tim 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The proclamation of the word must be done in season and out of season.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One has to labor diligently, whether in season or out of season.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A worker of the Lord has to work in season and out of season.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that he has to be very diligent.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All the apostles were extremely diligent.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Think of the colossal amount of work Paul accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may be eighty years old before we have done one tenth of what he did.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must realize that all servants of the Lord are diligent.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In considering Paul's work, we can see that he was truly diligent.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There was no laziness in him whatsoever.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was either traveling from place to place, preaching the gospel wherever he went, or reasoning intently with individuals and teaching them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even when he was in prison he was still writing his Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Epistles which touched the peak of spiritual revelations were all written in his prison cell.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although he was bound within the cell walls, God's word was not bound.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul was truly a diligent man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was like his Master, who was never slothful.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the original language of the New Testament, there are three Greek words for slothfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first is argos, the second is nothros, and the third is okneros.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All three words mean slothfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They are translated differently in the New Testament 1 Tim 5:13; Rom 12:11; Heb 5:11; 6:12; Matt 12:36; 20:3, 6; 2 Pet 1:8; Phil 3:1; Titus 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whether the words are translated as idle, slothful, sluggish, irksome, or dull, they all mean a refusal or reluctance to work or do things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To be slothful means to ignore the work or to reduce the work until it becomes no work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is a joke about a doorkeeper whose responsibility was to open the door whenever visitors rang the bell.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One day the bell rang, but he did not open the door.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When asked why he did not open it, he answered, "I am hoping the bell will stop ringing!"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Visitors were waiting to come in, yet he was hoping the bell would stop ringing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Brothers and sisters, what kind of person is this?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Unfortunately, this is the way many behave in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They hope that things will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even when things do not go away, they hope that they will not become a burden to them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In their mind they are saying, "How I would thank the Lord if these things went away and I did not have to deal with them!"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is slothfulness!</S>
