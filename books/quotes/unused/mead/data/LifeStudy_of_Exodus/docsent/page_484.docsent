   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BLOOD AND THE FIRE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The incense altar was connected to the altar of burnt offering mainly by the blood of the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First the blood of the sin offering was shed at the altar in the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then it was brought to the incense altar and sprinkled on it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The remainder of the blood was poured out at the base of the altar of burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, the redeeming blood joined the two altars.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This indicates that the prayer offered to God at the incense altar should be based on the experience at the first altar.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once we have experienced the first altar, we shall have the base, the standard, the ground, to come to the second altar to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The two altars were also connected by fire.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The fire that burned on the altar in the outer court was used to burn the incense at the incense altar in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The two altars, therefore, were connected by both the blood and the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The blood signifies that our sin and trespasses have all been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sin has been taken away, and the trespasses have been borne away.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The blood gives us the assurance of this.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Concerning this, there is nothing left for us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The blood has solved the problem of sin and of trespasses.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>REDUCED TO ASHES</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But what does the fire indicate?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The fire indicates that whatever we are needs to be reduced to ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to be burned so that we become ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Certain Christians, especially those of us in the Lord s recovery, often speak about being natural.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is only one way for us not to be natural, and that way is for us to be burned to ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you have not been burned, you are still natural.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Suppose you have a wooden table in front of you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>That table exists in its natural state.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But if the table is burned and becomes a heap of ashes, it is no longer natural.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This illustrates the fact that when something is burned to ashes, it is no longer natural.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I do not presume to say of myself that all believers in Christ need to become ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the Lord s desire, not mine.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When some hear that the Lord Jesus wants us to be burned to ashes, they may say, Christ is the One who is reduced to ashes by burning.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The fire at the altar burns Him; it does not burn me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to remember, however, that according to typology the offerer laid his hands upon the sacrifice and thus identified himself with that sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means that the sacrifice includes the one offering it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When Christ died on the cross, we died in Him, for we were included in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To say the least, when we believed in Him, we laid our hands on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To believe in Christ is to lay our hands on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, since we are one with the Christ who has been burned to ashes, we also are burned to ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some may ask, If we are burned to ashes, how shall we be able to live?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul gives the answer in Galatians 2:20: I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ s death brings in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now in Christ we are in resurrection, and it is no longer we who live, but Christ lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, for most Christians, Galatians 2:20 is merely doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They do not have much experience of it in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In a foregoing message we pointed out that with the sin offerings we can see three things: the blood, the ashes, and the sweet savor ascending to God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The blood and the ashes are related to us, whereas the sweet savor is for God s satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thank the Lord that today we have the blood as the sign and assurance that our sin and our trespasses have all been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We also have the ashes as a sign that we have been crucified, terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we become ashes, we are no longer a natural person.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Instead, we are a person who has been crucified, terminated, burned.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>No longer are we a natural man we have become a heap of ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Nevertheless, for most of us this is true only doctrinally; it is not yet true experientially.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, we need to go on to have the experience of actually being reduced to ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is unfortunate that many Christians know only the blood that was shed at the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They do not realize that at the cross there is also fire.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>With these believers there is the blood, but no ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They remain natural, unburned.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They surely have not become ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>How, then, can such believers pray at the golden altar of incense in the tabernacle?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The answer is that it is impossible for them to pray there.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we believed in the Lord Jesus and confessed our sins to God, we prayed to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But we prayed at the first altar in a shallow way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Because we prayed only for ourselves, that prayer cannot be regarded as intercessory prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It was a personal prayer for our situation; it was not an intercession for others.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Intercession cannot be made at the first altar; it must be made at the second altar.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But who can pray at the second altar?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Those who pray at the second altar must first be burned to ashes; that is, they must no longer be a natural person.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Every one who would pray at the incense altar must become a heap of ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we come into the tabernacle, we cannot go directly to the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As we have already indicated, first we must go to the showbread table, then to the lampstand, and after that to the ark of testimony in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Only then shall we be ready to come to intercede at the incense altar.</S>
