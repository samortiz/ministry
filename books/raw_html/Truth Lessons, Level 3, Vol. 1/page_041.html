THE LION OF JUDAH TYPIFYING CHRIST<br />AS THE ULTIMATE OVERCOMER</h2><p>Genesis 49 gives a record of the mature Jacob&rsquo;s prophesying with blessing concerning his twelve sons. In Jacob&rsquo;s prophecy he likened Judah to a lion (v. 9). The lion of Judah typifies Christ as the ultimate Overcomer. Revelation 5:5 reveals that Christ as the Lion of the tribe of Judah has overcome. He has accomplished everything that God required of Him. He took away sin, solved the problem of the world, defeated Satan, abolished death, and eliminated every negative thing.</p>
