   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SALVATION BY BAPTISM Issue Nos.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>5 and 6 Scripture Reading: Gen 6:1-9; 8:1a, 4-5, 13-21; 1 Pet 3:20-21; Mark 16:16a</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We are all familiar with the story of Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Most church- goers are also well acquainted with this story.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have probably heard the story of the ark many times.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today we want to consider what the Bible really teaches us concerning the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Bible there are different meanings to the matter of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In some cases, salvation has to do with our position before God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In other cases it has to do with our acceptance before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some cases have to do with our fellowship with God, while others have to do with our position in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It seems that salvation is not that simple and is somewhat confusing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But I can explain and clarify this with a little illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A FEW TYPES OF SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Genesis 3 we see the coats of skins.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"Unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins, and clothed them" v. 21 . This is a type of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But which aspect of salvation does it typify?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It typifies our justification before God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The sacrifice of Abel in Genesis 4 is also a type of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God was not pleased with the sacrifice of Cain, but accepted the sacrifice of Abel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because Cain offered his sacrifice out of himself, God was not pleased with it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Abel's sacrifice was based on the redeeming lamb and accepted by God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All the sacrifices in the Bible speak of God's acceptance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The story of the prodigal son in Luke 15 also speaks of God's acceptance of sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Ephesians 1 says that God has accepted us in His Beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, Genesis 4 is a type of salvation in which God accepts man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The rapture of Enoch in Genesis 5 is also a type of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is a type of salvation in the aspect of overcoming death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Genesis 3 is a type of justification.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Genesis 4 is a type of God's acceptance, and Genesis 5 is a type of victory over death.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The ark in chapter six is also a type.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But this type is different from those in Genesis 3 through 5.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The first type speaks of our justification before God; the second type speaks of our acceptance before God; while the third speaks of victory over death and receiving eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In chapter six we see the relationship between a Christian and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How can a Christian be delivered from all the things that God has condemned?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How can he be delivered from all the things that are under God's judgment?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The way we receive God's salvation speaks of the way to be delivered from God's condemnation and judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This kind of deliverance is one in which we escape out of a certain kind of snare.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There are different kinds of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The sins mentioned in Genesis 3 through 6 are all different.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Sin against God is mentioned in chapter three; it is a sin before God, a sin of disobedience against God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Man's sin before God requires God's coats of skins for covering so that man can be justified before God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Sin against both God and one's neighbor is mentioned in chapter four.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Cain committed the sin of murdering his own brother.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He broke two of God's commandments: to love the Lord our God with all our heart, all our mind, and all our soul and to love our neighbor as ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This sin requires a sacrifice before one can be accepted again before God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even when a person has committed a sin before men, he has to be accepted before God first; without this his sin is not yet behind him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The sin of forgetting God is mentioned in chapter five; it is different from the sins in chapters three and four.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Men ignored God and acted according to their own will.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Daily they ate their own bread and lived their own lives.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But in this chapter we see one man who walked with God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>While the whole world was filled with death, and man rejected God, He delivered Enoch out of that world of death, and caused him not to see death.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The sin of the world as a whole being in opposition to God is mentioned in chapter six.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The sin in chapter three is personal sin; the sin in chapter four is one person's sin against another; the sin in chapter five is the sin of the majority of the people; while the sin in chapter six is the corporate sin.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Chapter six is on humanity as a world organization, association, and sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Consequently, the sin in chapter six speaks of the whole human race sinning against God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Chapter six presents the sphere of the world; it speaks of the world having sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>THE JUDGMENT OF THE FLOOD</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now let us consider chapter six.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The beginning of this chapter speaks of fallen angels and sinful men, and how they collaborated to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We do not have to ask about the special significance of this passage.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All we need to know is that the sons of God, who were fallen angels, and the daughters of men, who were sinful men, were both created by God; they both had spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When they collaborated to sin, that was the end of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the first world the angels sinned, and in the second world men sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Hence, when angels and men joined together to sin, we know that the end was near, and the sinful angels and sinful men were about to be judged by God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>By this time, man had become extremely fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Whether he was practicing good in the flesh or committing sins in the flesh, he had become utterly fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, God would not strive with him anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Originally, the Spirit of God strove with man.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But now man had disobeyed God and degraded to the point where God's Spirit could no longer strive with him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In other words, man had become so corrupt that God's Spirit was no longer able to contend with him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>To put it in another way, man had become so corrupt that even the Holy Spirit could not change him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When a man has become fleshly, the Holy Spirit can do nothing about him; even his own devices cannot change him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>As a result the Holy Spirit could only retreat and allow the world to go through judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Please remember that our flesh today is no better than man's flesh in Noah's time.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If a man has not crucified his flesh with its lusts on the cross, the Holy Spirit cannot operate on him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Holy Spirit does not exhort man to improve himself, because man can never improve himself.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Holy Spirit only convicts man to be born again.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>There is no ability in the flesh to do good and not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Only those who are regenerated and who have received the new life can meet God's standard.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Being regenerated is not merely to weep, confess, become zealous, study the Bible much, or pray much.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Being regenerated is to receive another life, a life that comes from God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is inheriting another life from God.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Regeneration is being born a second time.</S>
