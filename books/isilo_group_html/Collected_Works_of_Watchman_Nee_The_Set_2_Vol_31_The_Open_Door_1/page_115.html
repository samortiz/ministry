O. Box 84, Hankow, May 1938)</h2><h2 class="head1">NEWS CONCERNING THE WORK</h2><h2 class="head2">The Recent Condition of the Work<br />in a Few Places in Yunnan</h2><h2 class="head3">Bao-Shiu</h2><p>We have received the fourth issue of The Open Door, and we have learned that many co-workers are pioneering in the interior under God's direction, particularly in Yunnan. I spontaneously sang hallelujah when I saw this situation. I went to Bao-Shiu to work for one week and have now returned to Shi-Ping. Had it not been for the Lord's intervention, it would have been impossible to preach the gospel there. I felt it was especially difficult for several reasons. First, the people reject outsiders no matter where they are from. They ignore you (which subsequently leaves you without a place to stay). If you want to rent a house, it is even more difficult. Second, strange rumors are spread, such as, "If you believe in Western religion, you will end up in such and such a way." Before I went to Bao-Shiu, I met the chief of the Bureau of Public Safety. He was happy to give me hospitality, so I worked there for a week. I could not rent a room, so I only preached salvation through the Lord's grace and returned to Shi-Ping.</p><p>Lin Kwang-tsao<br />March 22</p><h2 class="head3">Ku-Jiu</h2><h2 class="head4">One</h2><p>I boarded a train in Shi-Ping on March 30 and went to Ku-Jiu. The population of Ku-Jiu has increased rapidly, and the cost of living has gone up tremendously. It seems like a good opportunity to preach the gospel. The first day I went out, it seemed that I did not have the assurance of anything. There seemed to be a great pressure to live in the inn. It was almost as if I could not move. I did not know how God wanted to start the work. The second day God marvelously arranged for me to meet some brothers. Although they do not have as much spiritual wisdom as the brothers from other provinces, they have an honest love and invited me into their homes. I met a good brother. He is a (Western) doctor and sympathizes with us much. Now I have a Bible study in these brothers' homes every evening. The topics are all on matters of life. May God hide me so that others may only see Him working.</p><p>Lin Kwang-tsao<br />April 3</p><h2 class="head4">Two</h2><p>After we left K'un-ming on the seventh, we arrived at six o'clock in the evening in Ah-Mi-Jou. We left Ah-Mi-Jou at six o'clock in the morning on the eighth and arrived in Bi-Se-Zhai at eight o'clock and changed trains for Ku-Jiu. When we arrived in Mong-Tze, Sister Hsiao Ru-chuan welcomed us at the train station. We spoke joyfully with her and then boarded the bus for Ku-Jiu. We were preserved by the Lord along the way. He provided seats for us on even the most crowded trains. We really thank and praise Him! When we arrived in Ku-Jiu, Brother Lin Kwang-tsao and Mr. Gung En-lung (who was recently saved in a clear way) came together to receive us into Mr. Gung's house. It was the Lord's sovereign arrangement for Brother Lin to meet this brother here. They now have a Bible study every evening. There are a little more than ten people in attendance. We hope that a local church can be established by next Lord's Day so that we can start breaking bread to remember the Lord. This Lord's Day we began a traveling table meeting to remember the Lord. (The brothers and sisters who are clearly saved can attend this meeting to break bread and remember the Lord.) Brother Gung is a good brother arranged by the Lord to bear responsibility in Ku-Jiu. He is willing to donate a room for the use of the meetings. During the day three of us go out and preach the gospel outdoors, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. There are usually sixty to seventy people listening in the street. We take turns preaching. The audience pays close attention. May the Lord Himself save sinners. We do not know when we will leave this place, but we plan to work for at least another five or six days. After the work is finished, we plan to go to Shi-Ping to visit the brothers and sisters. If the Lord opens the door for us, we then plan to work in Lin-An, Mong-Tze, and the surrounding areas.</p><p>K. H.
