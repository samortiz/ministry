   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Church Being the Vessel</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Fulfill God s Purpose and to Solve His Problems</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church is the means and the vessel God uses today to fulfill His purpose and solve all His problems.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The preaching in Christianity tells people, We are poor, sinful persons who will perish, so we need God s mercy and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God is merciful and full of grace to us, so He sent His Son to save us from hell.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now we are the beloved ones, and when God puts us together, we are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is correct, but it is too poor and shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is mainly what we heard concerning the church in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to the revelation of the Word, however, the church is much deeper and higher than this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The church is the very vessel used by God to fulfill His purpose and to solve all His problems.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God s purpose and intention in creating the many human beings is to make these men a Body as a vessel to contain Him that He may dwell in them and manifest Himself through them by mingling Himself with them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is God s purpose on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, because one day Satan came in, God now has a problem, and He has an enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then death followed Satan, and where death is, there is darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Following darkness there is confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we had no light in this room, the whole room would be in confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Light is a controlling power.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are constantly, unconsciously controlled by light.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If there were no light, we could still do things, but we would do them in confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Where there is light, however, we do things under the control of the light.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When Satan came in, he injected himself into the human race to affect and influence the whole creation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then death came into the human race, and darkness and confusion followed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now there is death, darkness, and confusion in the whole of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The entire creation is subjected to vanity and is under the slavery of corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This corruption in the whole of creation came from darkness, darkness came from death, and death came from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is clearly revealed in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By this we can see that God has a purpose to fulfill, and He has an enemy and many problems death, darkness, confusion, corruption, slavery, and vanity in His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now God must do something for His creatures, because Satan has damaged them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Divine Sonship Being Accomplished</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>by Our Being Mingled with God</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>unto Full Sanctification</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God is working Himself into us and mingling Himself with us so that we may be holy, absolutely sanctified by Him, in Him, and with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every bit of our human nature will be mingled with the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the Old Testament type, every part of the boards of the tabernacle was overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the fulfillment of the type, God mingles Himself with the church so that we may be brought into full sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to the teaching of the New Testament, sonship first means that we are born of God to have God as our life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Second, it means that we grow up with God and in God, and third, it means that we are absolutely mingled with God; every part of our being will be permeated, saturated, overlaid, and absolutely mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Fourth, we are qualified to inherit all that God is, all that God has, and all that God has purposed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Fifth, we eventually are absolutely sanctified, holy, and divine.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the proper meaning of sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sonship implies a birthright, qualifying us to enjoy God by being mingled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>By being mingled with Him we are absolutely, thoroughly sanctified by Him, with Him, and in Him; within and without we are made holy and divine.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God s purpose is to have the church sanctified to such an extent.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the first item of God s purpose concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>TO SUBDUE AND DEFEAT GOD S ENEMY</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>BY DISPLAYING HIS MANIFOLD WISDOM</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>THROUGH THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The second aspect of God s purpose is to subdue and defeat His enemy by displaying His multifarious wisdom through the church Eph 3:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The more trouble the enemy causes, the more God will display His wisdom to him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>TO HEAD UP ALL THINGS IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>THROUGH THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The third aspect of God s purpose is that He will head up all things in Christ through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although this aspect of the church in God s economy is revealed in the Word of God, many Christians have not seen it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For this reason, we need to study several verses concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Ephesians 1:10 says, Unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Economy, or dispensation, and the fullness of the times are difficult phrases to understand and may seem strange to us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, they help us to realize that what is spoken here is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christ Being the Center, the Hub, and the Head</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the King James Version this verse says that He might gather together into one all things.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is better translated as to head up all things, as in Darby s New Translation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Head up in the Greek text is one word, not a phrase, the root of which is the word head, used as a verb.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Without a head, the universe is in confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We are all headed up by our head.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Because the head is upon the body, we may think that the body holds up the head.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, this is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we cut off the head, the body will fall.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This proves that it is the head that holds up the body.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>To cut off the head brings confusion and death to the whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>All things are to be headed up in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In God s economy Christ is the center, the hub, to be the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If all things are put under His headship, then all things are headed up; that is, they are gathered together into one.</S>
