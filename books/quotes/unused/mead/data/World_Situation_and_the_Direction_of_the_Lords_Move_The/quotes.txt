[1]  The World Situation and the Direction of the Lord s Move CONTENTS
[2]  THE PRESENT SPREADING OF THE LORD S RECOVERY Initiated in the Far East and Growing There
[3]  The Lord s recovery among us was initiated through Brother Nee approximately seventy years ago.
[4]  The entire world is open to the Lord s recovery today in the matter of the divine truth in the Bible because people are hungry for the divine truth.
[5]  THE IMPORTANCE OF EUROPE Europe, in Its Geographical Location,
[6]  The spreading of the truths of the Lord s recovery will be a preparation for the Lord s coming back to bring the recovery and restoration not only to Israel but also to the entire creation.
[7]  In chapter one we saw the recent changes in the world situation and the need of an appropriate direction for the Lord s move in His recovery today.
[8]  Some Christians may refer to the need of the spreading of the gospel, but in this chapter I want to stress the divine truths.
[9]  When I say the divine truths, I am referring to the New Testament economy of God, which is the gospel.
[10]  But outside of the Lord s recovery, who has taught, preached, or expounded the Bible on the truth of God s economy?
[11]  First, we have the divine revelation in the holy writings the writings of the holy Bible 2 Tim 3:16 .
[12]  The young people who are burdened to study in the universities there can talk to their classmates one by one about the truths concerning God s economy, God s dispensing, Christ, and the church.
[13]  The interpretation of the Bible advanced even more from the initiation of the Lord s recovery among us until now.
[14]  Once Brother Nee told me that because Europe and America had been spoiled for the Lord s move, that forced the Lord to go to China.
[15]  Furthermore, we have to thank the Lord that He has shown us more in the last few decades, such as the practical church life, the all-inclusive, life-giving, compound Spirit, even the seven Spirits, God s economy, God s dispensing, and the ultimate consummation of the church, that is, the New Jerusalem, the mingling of the processed Triune God with the transformed tripartite man for God s eternal manifestation and expression.
[16]  In the previous chapter, we saw the need of the spreading of the divine truths for the Lord s recovery and restoration.
[17]  In this chapter we want to see our responsibility for the spreading of the divine truths, especially to the crucial parts of the world.
[18]  Thirty years ago no one in the United States spoke clearly about God s economy, God s dispensing, the principle of the Body of Christ, and the practicality of the church life on the genuine ground of oneness with the local churches as the local expressions of the Body of Christ.
[19]  IN THE MATTER OF THE DIVINE TRUTHS The Catholic Church Being Heretical
[20]  Now we need to see Christianity s condition in the matter of the divine truths.
[21]  Now we want to see the Lord s gift and commission to His recovery in the divine truths.
[22]  The Lord has opened to us His divine revelation from the making of His eternal economy to the consummation of His eternal goal the New Jerusalem.
[23]  For the expounding of the New Testament and the publishing of this exposition for the benefit of the churches and the Lord s children, I made the decision to have two trainings yearly with the help from the trainees and the work of the polishers and the serving ones in the ministry office so that the word of the Lord s truths may be released regularly.
[24]  The Lord s Present Charge to Us Should Be:
[25]  We also should minister to people the items of God s salvation in the life of Christ, in regenerating us, renewing us, sanctifying us, transforming us, conforming us into His image, and glorifying us in Christ as the glory.
[26]  THE GOSPEL, INCLUDING THE TRUTHS Not by the Apostles but by the Migrated Disciples
[27]  Now we need to consider the initial example of the spreading of the gospel, including the truths Acts 8:1, 4 .
[28]  IN THE COUNTRIES OF EUROPE Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 14:25; 11:25; Matt 18:19-20; Acts 12:12; Rom 15:16; John 21:15; 1 Thes 2:7; Heb 10:24-25; Eph 4:12; 1 Cor 14:1, 3-5, 31; Rom 14:1, 3; 15:7; Eph 4:1-6; 1 Cor 1:10-13; Rom 16:17; Titus 3:10; Matt 20:25-27; 23:8-11; 1 Pet 5:5
[29]  In the previous chapter, we saw our responsibility for the spreading of the divine truths.
[30]  A great part of the divine truths we have received from the Bible are based upon the light the Brethren received in the nineteenth century.
[31]  Based upon the help we received from the Brethren, the Lord has gone on in His present recovery to show us many more divine truths.
[32]  In this chapter we want to see the way to spread the Lord s recovery in the countries of Europe.
[33]  After the four-day, four-hour war with Iraq, I received a burden to invade Europe with the divine truths of the Lord s recovery.
[34]  Initially, I considered that we should go to Europe in the first step to Great Britain, France, Germany, and Russia.
[35]  But after receiving reports from the brothers who traveled to Europe, I realized that our main goal should be eastern Germany and western Russia.
[36]  Furthermore, we should realize that Great Britain is very crucial for the Lord s move throughout Europe.
[37]  We are looking to the Lord for the publishing of one million copies, as proposed by some Russian brothers to us, of each of the six books we mentioned in chapter one The Normal Christian Life, The Spiritual Man, The Experience of Life, The Knowledge of Life, The Economy of God , and God s New Testament Economy.
[38]  We also need to work by contacting people in preaching the high gospel, in teaching the deeper truths, and in testifying the Christian experience.
[39]  For our existence we need the light, the air, and the land, but we are also human beings in God s image according to God s likeness.
[40]  We also need to serve in the Spirit according to the divine revelation.
[41]  We need to meet according to the God-ordained way as revealed in the New Testament, fully in mutuality, avoiding the one-man ministry, and abhorring the system of clergy and laity, for worshipping God, remembering the Lord, praying, saving sinners, feeding the new believers, perfecting the saints, and building up the church as the organic Body of Christ, without any element of the traditional way, formality, and ritual 1 Cor 14:25; 11:25; Matt 18:19-20; Acts 12:12; Rom 15:16; John 21:15; 1 Thes 2:7; Heb 10:24-25; Eph 4:12; 1 Cor 14:1, 3-5, 31 .
[42]  CONCERNING THE SUPPLY OF OUR NECESSITIES The Full-Timers Living a Life by Faith,
[43]  The full-timers should live a life by faith, trusting in the Lord for their necessities and receiving the Lord s supply through the saints and the churches.
[44]  If we feel led and burdened by the Lord to go full-time, we should not worry about our necessities.
[45]  Maintaining a Good Order in the Body of Christ
[46]  In the Lord s recovery, on the one hand, we should keep the oneness of the Body of Christ, and on the other hand, we should maintain a good order in the Body of Christ.
[47]  For the Lord s recovery to remain in a proper condition, we need both the oneness and a good order.
[48]  We have God as our Father, and we have Christ as our Lord and Head.
