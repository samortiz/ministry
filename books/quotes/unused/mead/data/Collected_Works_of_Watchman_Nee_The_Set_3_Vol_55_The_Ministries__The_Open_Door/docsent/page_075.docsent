   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ISSUE NO.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>21 September 15, 1950 SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A RECORD OF A TALK WITH CO-WORKERS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we are gathered today, I think I have something to say.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Let us first look at two passages of the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Colossians 4:5 says, "Redeeming the time," and Ephesians 5:16 says, "Redeeming the time."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I have wanted to talk to you about this matter in these past few days.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There are several Greek words for the word time, as it is translated in the two verses we just read.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In both these passages, the Greek word is not chronos, but kairos.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This word does not merely refer to time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There are many passages which use this Greek word in conjunction with other words, and in those instances it is translated opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Galatians 6:10 says, "As we have the opportunity, let us do what is good toward all."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This means that we should seize the opportunity to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These words from the Bible show us the Lord's thought about opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord considers opportunity to be something very important.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One could translate the word time in the passages from Colossians and Ephesians as "redeeming the opportunity."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I do not know how much you understand the word opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I always wonder how many opportunities I have missed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In many matters, on the negative side, we do not know how many opportunities we have missed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many things which we can do are all too easily missed by us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many people which we can save are all too easily neglected by us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many cities where we can start an assembly are all too easily overlooked by us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many brothers whom we can gain are lost through us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have lost so many opportunities!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we face the Lord in the future, we will truly have much regret to face!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are confused and unclear about everything, and we do not know how many opportunities we have missed!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Of the days which the Lord has ordained for us, perhaps yesterday should have been the greatest day of our life, but we may have lived yesterday in an ordinary way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is what it means to miss the opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One who is learning to serve should not do the same thing today as he did yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If he is the same today as yesterday, he has squandered his opportunities.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we do not know what the Lord is doing today or what is going to happen today, we are missing the opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the early days in Shanghai, the brothers did not pay attention to the need for a meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As a result, we do not know how many souls we lost.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I want to say to the brothers who want to save their money, "You have indeed saved your money, but you have lost the souls of men!"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We could have saved more souls, but because there was not enough space for them, some were lost.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Losing a soul is losing an opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Souls were lost when we saved our money.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We now think that we have spent our all in moving from Hardoon Road to Nanyang Road.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It may never have occurred to us that if we had not missed some opportunities before the Lord, certain kinds of meetings would never have been started.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have missed some opportunities, and as a result, some meetings were produced.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is very easy for us to work in a place in a habitual way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Every Lord's Day we preach the word; every week we have an edification meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We think it is all right if we gain ten to twenty people a week.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We do not know that the Lord wanted us to gain one thousand in one day.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Through negligence we lose nine hundred of them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We throw away and miss many opportunities.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As I was considering this whole matter, I thought perhaps the Lord would want to gain more people in Yangshupu than at Nanyang Road.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But can we seize the opportunity?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Perhaps the Lord wants to gain more people at North Szechuan Road than He does at Nanyang Road.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Can we seize the opportunity?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Perhaps the Lord wants to gain more people in Nanshi than He does at Nanyang Road.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Can we grasp the opportunity?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>No worker or servant of the Lord can feel satisfied with what he has done so far.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All who are satisfied with the present are losing opportunities.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We do not know what great things the Lord wants to do.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Among the 470 million people in China, there are only a few hundred thousand Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We do not know how many opportunities we have already lost!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I believe that God has given more opportunities than we can imagine.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we can seize every opportunity God gives us, the increase of the work will be according to God's expectation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The work has not increased as God wants because we have limited it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We hope this limitation will end here today.</S>
