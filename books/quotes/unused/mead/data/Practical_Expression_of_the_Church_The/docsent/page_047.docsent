   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"OUT OF WHOM"</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Ephesians 4:16, the phrase "from whom" in Greek means "out of whom."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The supply comes out of Christ, into whom we have grown as our Head.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have grown into Him, and now something flows out of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The "into" in verse 15 goes along with the "out of" in verse 16.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, we must grow into Him; then out of Him will come something to build the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Out of Him, the whole Body fitly joins together, the joints supply, and every part has a measure.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that every member has a measure.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That is why we must grow and grow and grow.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And that is also why we stress life again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We all must grow into the Head; then out of the Head we will receive something to minister to the Body for the building up of the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must forsake the concept that we are coming to the meeting simply to get help from the gifted persons.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is something from our background.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we are going to have a proper church life, we must give up the clergy-laity system, give up ourselves to let Christ take over, and give up the concept that we come to the meetings to receive help from those who are gifted.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I should come to the meeting as a member of the Body who has grown into the Head so that out of Him I have something to minister to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then, while I am ministering to the Body, I will also receive the ministry from the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the function which builds up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>NO EXPERTS IN THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When I was in Pittsburgh in 1964, a brother said, "Oh Brother Lee, in this modern day we need experts in every business; so for the church service we also need experts.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need some brothers to be full time experts; the rest simply do not have the time to take care of the church service.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are busy with our education and occupations, and the sisters are busy with their families and homes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We do need some experts for the church service."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But I told this brother that this is the clergy of the denominations, not the priesthood of the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some may say, "It is too hard to be a member in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You must give yourself to be captured by Christ and grow.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>And you also must give up the concept of getting help from others, but go to the meetings to minister something yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is too much.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I cannot go this way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I like to be an easy Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I work five days a week, and when Sunday comes I need to rest a while.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I want to go to a church where I can sit to enjoy others' ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That is the time for the experts to do their job and for me to enjoy their work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I do not like your kind of church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I must give up this and give up that; I have to do this and I have to do that.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is simply too much."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I sympathize with those who say this, but there is no other way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To them it is a hard job, but to us it is a real enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is an enjoyment to give up ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is an enjoyment to be captured and gained by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And it is an enjoyment to come to the meetings to minister something of Christ as life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some may say that this is difficult, but we say that it is our best enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It all depends upon the concept we have, and it also depends upon the taste we have.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we have a taste for the organizational way of sitting and listening, we cannot have the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our taste must be for the living function of all the members of the Body in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When all of the members function, we will become a living organism, fighting the battle for the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Otherwise, we simply have a group of brothers and sisters as a kind of organization.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>May the Lord be merciful to us that we all may be so willing and aggressive to have the proper functions in the church.</S>
