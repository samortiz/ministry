   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the full-time training in Taipei, I told the trainers not to bring the new ones to the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Occasionally, some new ones asked the trainees to bring them to a church meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After one or two church meetings, these new ones said they did not want to go to the church meeting again.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They liked to enjoy the meeting in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They did not have a taste for the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But with many of us it is exactly the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have a taste for the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When you bring your contacts to a meeting, you may like to have a big hall, a large congregation, and a big, eloquent speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All of this is a good facade.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have been meeting in this way in our localities for many years, and what has been the result?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have had hardly any increase, but instead have been maintaining a traditional Christian worship service.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>People today are quarreling, debating about doctrine and about different practices in Christianity, but I am not burdened merely for the doctrines or for practices.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I only care for the New Testament faith, the Christian faith, the New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As long as we have this, let us take the new way to have the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to the statistics of religious bodies in the United States, eight large denominations have decreased in their membership the United Methodists, the Presbyterians, The Lutheran Church in America, the Episcopalians, The Lutheran Church Missouri Synod, the American Lutherans, the United Church of Christ, and the Churches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Assemblies of God have increased, yet by only six percent a year.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This increase of the Assemblies of God is the highest.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The second is the United Pentecostals with a 4.8 percent increase per year.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The yearly percentage of increase for the Roman Catholic Church in the United States is only .68 percent.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This confirmed that the way of Christianity does not work well.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nevertheless, we have been and are still under the influence of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To some extent we follow them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sixty years ago at the beginning of the Lord's recovery in China, we mostly followed the Brethren way, but the number of Plymouth Brethren in the United States is only ninety-eight thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is much too low a number.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The entire way of Christianity does not work well.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Could we be satisfied to have a six percent yearly increase?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must take the new way!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>And the new way has been practiced and fully proven: it works.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Over seven thousand were baptized in Taipei within less than four months.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The brother from that local church of sixty told us that six were baptized by one team within an hour and a half.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is according to our training.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We present them the truth in a quick way with no vain talk, and we believe in the Lord's word concerning baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our practice has proven that the proper baptism by water really works out something.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>One brother knocked on a certain door and the man who answered said he was not interested.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then the brother went to the back door, the kitchen door, and knocked.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The man told the brother again that he was not interested.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The brother then said to the man, "Since you will not allow me to come in, please come out."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>That man took the order and came out.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This brother read to him a short paragraph from The Mystery of Human Life and that man got baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many were like this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After being baptized, they became happy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They were changed.</S>
