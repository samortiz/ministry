   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not Glorifying God and</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Not Worshipping Him</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the ancient times man knew God, but did not glorify Him as God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Neither did they thank Him, worship Him, or serve Him 1:21, 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is another element in the source of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Refusing to glorify God, thank God, worship God, and serve God is a major aspect of the source of wickedness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, if we glorify and thank Him, worship and serve Him, we will be protected from every evil.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There are so many divorces and so much immorality throughout the world today because people will not glorify God and worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A man who glorifies God, thanks God, worships God, and serves God, will never divorce his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All divorces and immorality come from one source refusing to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Never think that worshiping God is an insignificant matter and that glorifying Him is trivial.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They mean a great deal to our human living.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to thank God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have many things for which to thank Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some people do not thank God until the hour of their death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although that is very late, it is better than nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to realize that glorifying God, thanking God, worshiping God, and serving God are extremely important.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Suppose I have a bad temper, a shameful and ugly disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If I try to suppress it, I will never succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, if I thank and praise God continually, I will find the best method of escape from my poor disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whenever you are about to lose your temper, you should say, I am going to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I don t have time to lose my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God, I thank You that You are my God, that You are my Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Without You, I would have no being.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I owe my very existence to You.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I thank You, worship You, and serve You.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you do this, you will be freed from your disposition immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How much we need to worship God!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Exchanging God</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then mankind exchanged God 1:23, 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is terrible to exchange God, for God is the glory and the reality of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When God is expressed, that is glory.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To exchange God means to give Him up for something else.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The people exchanged God for idols.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God is glory; idols are vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God is reality; idols are a falsehood and a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How foolish and awful it was for man to exchange God for idols!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Most of the people in the United States have learned not to worship visible idols, although some people do practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Nevertheless, many people in this country have exchanged God for their self-made idols their future, positions, degrees, and goals.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means that their future, position, degrees, and goals have become their idols.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They care for these idols, not for God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, they also have exchanged God for idols.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we consider carefully these four aspects of the source of wickedness, we will see that they constitute the origin of every kind of evil and sinfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>B. The Result of Giving Up God</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now we need to inquire into the result of giving up God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Being Given Up by God</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The first result of giving up God is being given up by God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When you give up God, this forces God to give you up.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you let go of God, God will be compelled to let go of you.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is most deplorable.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is terrible to be given up by God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must say to God, Even if I let You go, don t let me go.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Perhaps I will be so foolish as to give You up.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Lord, be merciful to me and never give me up.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need to pray in this way, for it is awful to be given up by God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When a person has been given up by God, he will never do good things.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He will not improve but only descend lower and lower.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>According to Romans 1, God gives people up to three things.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>First is uncleanness 1:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When a person gives up God and forces God to give him up, that person will be defiled, immediately becoming involved with uncleanness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Second, God gives up people to passions of dishonor, to shameful lusts 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I do not like to mention these shameful lusts with my clean lips.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Such people may become sodomites, indulging in evil passions and unrestricted affection, dishonoring their bodies with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Third, God gives people up to a disapproved mind 1:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If you disapprove of holding God in your knowledge, God will allow you to have a mind that He disapproves.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The mind of sinful men can never be approved by God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>For example, God disapproves of a mind that is occupied with thoughts of divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Look at today s sinful society: no one has a mind that can be approved by God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>All have been given up by God to a disapproved mind, for they do that which is improper.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>People are so foolish and shameful in their sinful ways.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Their behavior is absolutely improper.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Nevertheless, they continue in sin because God has given them up to a disapproved mind.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Having Fornication</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Confusion in Order</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When a person has been given up by God to uncleanness, dishonorable lusts, and to a disapproved mind, the consequence is fornication 1:24, 26, 27 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Do you know the true meaning of fornication?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Fornication means to violate the governing and controlling principle.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This brings about confusion in order.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>God s economy is one husband for one wife.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is not only God s economy; it is His ruling and controlling principle.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The people who have been given up by God will do almost anything to break this principle, violating the governing principle of one husband for one wife.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The result is fornication, confusion in order.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Why do people engage in this?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Because of uncleanness, passions of dishonor, and their disapproved minds.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When people give up God, He gives them up to fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Every kind of wickedness issues out of this fornication 1:29-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>At the end of Romans 1, Paul enumerates the various kinds of evil and describes the wicked persons, such as the whisperers, backbiters, and God-haters.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>By this we can see that if a person gives up God, God will give him up to lusts, confusion, and every evil imaginable.</S>
