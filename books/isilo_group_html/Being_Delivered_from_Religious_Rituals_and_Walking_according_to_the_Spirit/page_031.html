<p>The Bible does not give a definite way for Christians to meet, but it does say what the early Christians did in their meetings. In the entire New Testament, only 1 Corinthians 14 says something concerning how to meet. The Gospel of Matthew says that only two or three can be gathered into the Lord&rsquo;s name (18:20). Acts speaks of the meetings of the believers, but it does not give the specifics of how they met. Only 1 Corinthians says something concerning how to meet.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being Our Portion</h2>
<p>First Corinthians contains several basic points. The first basic point is that Christ is the allotted portion given to us by God (1:2). God has given Christ to us as our portion. When the children of Israel entered the land of Canaan, everyone was allotted a portion of the land. The Lord Jesus is our good land, and we have a share of the allotted portion (Col. 1:12). Hence, Christ is &ldquo;theirs and ours&rdquo; (1 Cor. 1:2); He belongs to all the believers. He is our portion. God has made Christ, who is our portion, to be our power and our wisdom (v. 24). He also became our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption (v. 30). He is our Passover (5:7), our foundation (3:11), and our spiritual food, spiritual water, and spiritual rock (10:3-4). Christ is also our Head (11:3). As our portion, He is our everything. Christ was the last Adam to be our Redeemer, and then He became the life-giving Spirit (15:45). Christ, who is our portion, is the Spirit who gives life to us. This is the first basic point in 1 Corinthians.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing the Spirit and Exercising Our Spirit</h2>
<p>The second basic point is that we must know and exercise our spirit. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; We must be spiritual persons who walk in the spirit and live by the spirit. In 2:1 Paul says, &ldquo;I, when I came to you, brothers, came not according to excellence of speech or of wisdom.&rdquo; Then in verse 4 he says, &ldquo;My speech and my proclamation were not in persuasive words of wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power.&rdquo; The word <em>demonstration</em> indicates expression. Paul&rsquo;s speaking with the saints was not according to excellence of speech or persuasive words of wisdom. His speaking was a demonstration of the Spirit so that the Spirit would be manifested, expressed. Believers in the Pentecostal movement say that the Spirit is expressed when they speak in tongues. However, we need to combine 2:4 with 14:6, which says, &ldquo;Brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what will I profit you, unless I speak to you either in revelation or in knowledge or in prophecy or in teaching?&rdquo; By combining these two verses, we can see that the demonstration, or expression, of the Spirit does not refer to speaking in tongues but to clear, ordinary words. The Spirit is expressed in clear words.</p>
<p>The first main point in 1 Corinthians is that Christ is our portion, and the second point is that we should exercise our spirit in order to enjoy this Christ. For this reason, in our meetings we should do nothing but exercise our spirit in order to present the Christ we have enjoyed.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Prophesying in the Meetings</h2>
<p>Christ being our portion and exercising our spirit in order to enjoy Christ as our everything are the main points in 1 Corinthians. These two main points should also be our living. What, then, should we do in the meetings? The meetings are for the exhibition of the Christ we have enjoyed in our living. In our daily life we exercise our spirit and enjoy Christ as our everything. Then in the meetings we exercise our spirit as a demonstration of the Spirit. When we exercise our spirit to present the Christ whom we have enjoyed to the saints, we are prophesying. In 1 Corinthians prophesying does not refer to predicting but to speaking for the Lord.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 1:2 says that Christ is theirs and ours. He is the last Adam who became the life-giving Spirit (15:45), and we have been joined to Him as one spirit (6:17). We do not need to go to heaven in order to be joined to Him. After His ascension, He descended in order to be joined to us in our spirit. Christ is in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). Hence, we can experience Him in our daily living when we exercise our spirit, and we can release our experiences of Christ with our spirit when we come to the meetings. This is very simple. This is what it means to prophesy, to speak for Christ. Since prophesying is so easy, we all can prophesy. However, we should not have long-winded speeches. We should be brief so that everyone has an opportunity to speak.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT IN OUR DAILY LIVING<br />
AND USING OUR SPIRIT IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>We need to be delivered from the influence of degraded Christianity. Then it will be easy to live the Christian life as well as to meet. It will be an ordinary thing for us to love the Lord, fellowship with Him, and live in our spirit. The Lord is our portion. He is the Spirit who lives in our spirit, and we exercise our spirit to contact Him. This is the way to have experiences of Christ. Then when we come to a meeting, our spirit will be living and released, and we will be ready to speak concerning our experience of Christ. If every saint would do this, our meetings would be rich. We can also use the Bible and our hymnal to receive inspiration and speak in the meetings. It is easy for our meetings to be fresh and rich.</p>
<p>Although the Christian life is a mystery, it is not difficult to comprehend. We need a change in concept. Once our concept is changed, our meetings will be different. We love the Lord, but we are still influenced by Christianity. I am burdened to pull the saints out of the influence of Christianity.</p>
<p>We are saved, and we love the Lord and pursue Him. Hence, we should daily use our spirit to call on Him and to contact Him. When we call, &ldquo;O Lord,&rdquo; we will experience Him. We can prove this in our experience. Our Lord is not a doctrine, nor is He nebulous. He is real and practical, and He is living in us. Not only so, He has given us the Bible, which contains His words. These words are not doctrine; they are spirit and life. If we pray-read these words regularly, we will touch and enjoy Him. Then every day and all day long we will have many experiences of the Lord.</p>
<p>If we practice touching the Lord every day, our spirit will be fresh and living. When we come to the meeting, our spirit will be ready, uplifted, and released. When our spirit is exercised, it will be released and manifested. Our spirit is manifested so that we can display the Christ we have experienced. When fifty to sixty saints display their portion of Christ, they supply one another, and the meeting is very rich. Then when we pray, praise, sing hymns, and pray-read, the meeting will be rich and fresh. There will be no need to follow old procedures or always have a message. In such a fresh and living meeting, we pave the way for the Lord to move.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICING OUR SKILLS IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>Our present need is to practice, and this is a matter of learning skills. Everything we do requires skill. On the one hand, in our daily life we need to live by the spirit by enjoying the Lord and experiencing Him. On the other hand, in the meetings we need to coordinate with others in our singing, praising, testifying, and pray-reading. In the meetings we need to function as a team. For this reason, we need to learn some skills. When someone is praying, I should refrain from praying. When no one is praying, I should release a prayer. When I hear another voice, I should stop. When he stops, I should continue from where he left off in a meaningful way. When we sing and pray the hymns, sometimes we can proceed sequentially from one stanza to the next, sometimes we can skip a stanza or two, and sometimes we can select certain stanzas. These matters require skill. When we pray over a stanza, there should be continuity in our prayer and the release of our spirit. Moreover, our voice should not be so loud that it hurts others&rsquo; ears or so soft that others cannot hear us. We need to take care of these matters. We should not be indifferent. Whatever we do needs skill. Without the proper skills, we cannot do a good job. Hence, we need to practice.</p>
<p>If we are willing to practice regularly, over time we will become skilled, and gradually our spirit will be able to flow where the Spirit wills. When the practice of exercising our spirit in the meetings is built up among us, it will become our family tradition, and it will be easy for new believers to join us. A child who is born into a Chinese-speaking family does not need a Chinese teacher to teach him the Chinese language; the child spontaneously learns to speak Chinese. Pray-reading has not yet been built up among us; hence, we must continue to practice. We have thrown away the old way of meeting, but if we are not able to build up the skill of using our spirit, we will be in a state of suspension. Some old things are gone, but new things have not been built up in their place. Of course, we do not want the old way, but we need to quickly learn the new way of doing everything according to the Spirit.</p>
<p>Doing things according to the Spirit is not an individual matter. All the serving ones must rise up and practice. When the serving ones are skilled, they can lead the whole church to practice in small groups. Gradually this practice of worshipping in the spirit will be established and become the practice in the churches.</p>
<p>We truly need to make this turn. Otherwise, we will limit the Lord. If we do not let the Lord work out this way among us, He will work it out with another group of people. The age has turned. If we let the Lord move among us, we will be blessed. However, if we do not let the Lord move, He will find another group of people. The Lord will take His way. He will not continue in the situation of Christianity any longer, nor will He allow the situation of oldness among us to continue.</p>
<p>Hence, we must endeavor to change our concept. In our daily living we must exercise our spirit to experience Christ. We must also endeavor to practice our skills in the meetings. We should look to the Lord and ask Him to give us the patience to practice. As believers, we are priests, and we need to learn how to serve and how to meet.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_030.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_032.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Being Delivered from Religious Rituals and Walking according to the Spirit &nbsp; pg 31</div><br></body></html>
