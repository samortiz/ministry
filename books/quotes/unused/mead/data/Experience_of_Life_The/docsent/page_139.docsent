   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN REIGNING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous chapter we have seen the matter of knowing the ascension; now we will go on immediately to see the experience of reigning.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Both lessons are closely related in experience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I. THE DEFINITION OF REIGNING</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Simply speaking, to reign is to exercise authority for God to rule all things and in particular to deal with His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have repeatedly mentioned in the past that in the creation of man God has a twofold intent and desire.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On one hand, God wants man to possess His image that he may express God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the other hand, God wants man to represent Him with His authority in order to deal with His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, when God created man, on one hand, He created him in His image and likeness that man might be like Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the other hand, God caused man to "have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth" Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that God gave man authority that he might reign for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Old Testament records many instances of man since Adam reigning for God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Exodus 14 tells how God wanted Moses to lift the rod and stretch it forth to divide the Red Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Joshua 10 tells how Joshua prayed to God that the sun might stand still in the sky.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First Kings 17-18 relates how Elijah prayed to control the rainfall.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Daniel 6 tells how Daniel shut the lions' mouths in the den.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All these instances show us that through the ages, as long as there are men willing to live for God, God desires to grant them authority that all things might come under their dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This matter is even more evident in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first one in the New Testament who ruled for God was the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He commanded illness to recede Matt 8:8-9 , cast out unclean spirits Mark 1:27 , and rebuked and calmed the storm and the raging sea Matt 8:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All these incidents speak of His reigning.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Later, when the Apostles continued the Lord's works, they also had many experiences of reigning for God by healing and casting out evil spirits Acts 3:6-7; 14:8-10; 19:12; 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To the present day, this kind of experience is often repeated in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then in the future and in the kingdom, the overcomers will reign with Christ and rule the nations Rev 2:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Finally in eternity all those who are saved will reign as kings forever and ever Rev 22:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At that time we will truly and fully enjoy the blessing of reigning for God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All these instances reveal that from the beginning until eternity, God's one intention is that He may gain man to reign for Him in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This was one aspect of God's purpose in creating man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even more, this was one aspect of God's intention in redeeming man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, from the point of view of authority, reigning is the final goal of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is the summit of our spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As for God, had He not saved us to the extent that we could reign for Him in the heavenly realm, the goal of His salvation would not have been considered fully accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, although this matter of reigning will not be completely realized until the coming of the kingdom and in eternity, yet today God wants us to have a beginning on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As for us, if any Christian has not yet reached the degree of reigning for God, he is not yet up to standard.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A Christian who is up to standard has not only been delivered from sin, has overcome the world, has had his flesh dealt with and his natural constitution broken, has been filled with the Holy Spirit, and is sitting in the heavenly realm, but even more he is reigning with Christ in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whether in God's work, in the church, at home, or in any encounter in his environment, he can reign and rule over that which God wants him to rule.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There must be such people gained by God that through them the authority of God can be executed and the kingdom of God can come upon the earth.</S>
