<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. JOB'S KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING GOD<br>IN HIS DEALINGS WITH ALL KINDS OF MEN</H2><P>In chapter twenty-four we see Job's knowledge concerning God in His dealings with all kinds of men.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. God's Dealing with the Ones<br>Who Seize Others' Possessions</H2><P>First, Job spoke concerning God's dealing with the ones who seize others' possessions, in particular with those who remove landmarks, seize the flock and pasture them, drive away the donkey of the fatherless, take the widow's ox as a pledge, and turn the needy out of the way (vv. 1-8). Then Job spoke of some who pluck the fatherless from the breast and take what the poor has on as a pledge (vv. 9-12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. God's Dealing with Those<br>Who Rebel against the Light</H2><P>Job continued by speaking regarding God's dealing with those who rebel against the light, who are not acquainted with its ways nor abide in its paths (v. 13). Included among such ones are murderers and adulterers, who do not know the light (vv. 14-16). "For morning is to all of them like the shadow of death,/Because they are acquainted with the terrors of the shadow of death" (v. 17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. God's Dealing with Those Who Sin</H2><P>Finally, in verses 18 through 25 Job spoke about God's dealing with those who sin. Job said that God preserves the mighty for awhile and then lets them be cut off like the ears of grain. Job concluded by saying, "If it is not so, then who will prove me a liar/And bring my words to nought?" (v. 25). It seems that here, in spite of his pain, Job was showing off to his friends.</P>
