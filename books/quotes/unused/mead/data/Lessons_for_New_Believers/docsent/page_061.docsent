   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCH EXISTING AS ONE IN THE UNIVERSE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is only one church in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are not many churches in the universe; there is only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since the source and production of the church are one, the existence of the church must also be one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to the nature of the oneness of the church, the existence of the church in the universe must be one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to the principle of the oneness of the church, the existence of the church in the universe should also be one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, the church is uniquely one in the universe; there is only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the aspect of the church emphasized in Ephesians 1:22-23.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE CHURCH IN EACH LOCALITY BEING ONE</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is only one church in the universe, and there is only one church in each locality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Regardless of whether the city was Jerusalem Acts 8:1 , Antioch 13:1 , Ephesus Rev 2:1 , or Corinth 1 Cor 1:2 , there was only one church in it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There can be only one church, not two or more, in each locality.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If there are two or more in one locality, the oneness of the church is immediately damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the saints in the universe belong to the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the same principle, all the saints in one locality belong to the church in that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If the believers in one locality become divided and form two churches, the oneness of the church is damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Regardless of the locality, there can be only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Taipei there is one church, and in Tainan there is also one church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Tokyo there is one church, and in New York City there is also one church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In a large locality there is one church, and in a small locality there is also one church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church is one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, in today s situation there are so many churches that there is almost one on every corner.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There can be an East Gate Church on one corner, and a Baptist Church on another corner, or there can be a Lutheran Church on this street and a Wesleyan Church on the next street.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This can be compared to a church market.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we see the light concerning the oneness of the church, we will abhor this situation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such a condition completely contradicts the oneness of the church by establishing more than one church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This can be compared to God s creation of man and woman.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God ordained that a man should marry one woman and that a woman should be married to one man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There should not be polygamy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>People in both the East and the West abide by this ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A person who is married to more than one person is looked down upon because in the human concept, marriage is meant to be between one man and one woman.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A man can have only one wife, and a woman can have only one husband.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This also applies to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There should be only one church in each locality.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If there are many churches in one locality, it is a big problem.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is not a small mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is a serious sin 3:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is a sin greatly abhorred by God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some people may say, Surely there are believers in these churches.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Surely some love the Lord zealously.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Yes, I agree that there are believers there.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, I would like to ask, Are there not believers and pious ones also in the Roman Catholic Church?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, Revelation 17 says that the Roman Catholic Church is a great harlot.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Brothers and sisters, this age is dark, and the condition of the church is confused.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We truly need God s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To those who have blurry eyesight, the Roman Catholic Church is a religion of piety, teaching man to believe in God, attend mass, and worship the crucified Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Little do they know that in God s eyes, Roman Catholicism is a great harlot.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, we should not ask whether they are a Christian organization, or whether they preach the same gospel, or whether they speak the truths in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should not assume that there is no problem as long as these conditions exist.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We cannot merely look at these things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They may have all these things, but in the Lord s eyes there is abominable confusion within.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As another example, even though some are of the church of Jesus Christ, why should they hang a sign of Wesley?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Why should they hang a sign of Luther?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If this is not spiritual fornication, what is it?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A church that has several names is no different from one woman who has several husbands!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In 1954 some believers went to Baguio in the Philippines.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When a renowned preacher from China heard that we were coming, he left.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Before leaving Baguio, he asked a brother whom he knew very well to ask me why we considered only ourselves to be the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I responded, as if jesting, and asked the brother to convey the following analogy to the preacher: One day, Mrs. Chao saw Mrs. Lee, Mrs. Liu, Mrs. Wang, and Mrs. Chang.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Being jealous, they asked Mrs. Chao, Why do you consider only yourself to be Mrs. Chao? Mrs. Chao replied, Why do you even ask me such a question? Do you not call yourselves Mrs. Lee, Mrs. Liu, Mrs. Wang, and Mrs. Chang?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The one church has been divided.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is something very offensive to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It offends the Lord even more than immoral sins.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The church that should be of Christ openly and shamelessly puts up a sign of Lutheran or of others.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Oh, what a shame!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is the same as Mrs. Chao calling herself Mrs. Chang.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Today the Protestant churches condemn the Roman Catholic Church, calling her a great harlot, but what about the Protestant churches?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Are they a pure and chaste woman in the eyes of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Those who have light will painfully admit that the Protestant churches have also become harlots!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>MANY LOCAL CHURCHES NOT BEING</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>MANY KINDS OF CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Although there are many local churches, there cannot be many kinds of churches.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There is only one kind of church.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Many is a matter of quantity, but kind is a matter of nature.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>For example, there are many churches in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There is a church in Tainan, a church in Taipei, a church in Taichung, and a church in Kaohsiung.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Since there are many localities, there are many churches.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>However, these churches cannot be many kinds of churches.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Since the nature of the church is one, there can be many churches in many localities, but there cannot be many kinds of churches.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The church in Taipei and the church in Tainan are of the same nature.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>However, today in many places there are not only many churches but many kinds of churches.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This shows that the oneness of the church has been lost and that the nature of the oneness has been changed.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We must see that the church is one; just as the church is one universally, the church is also one locally.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Although there are many churches in different localities, the nature of these churches is one; they are of the same kind.</S>
