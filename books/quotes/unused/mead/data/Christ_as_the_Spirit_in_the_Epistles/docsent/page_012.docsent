   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE CHRIST AS THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN EPHESIANS THROUGH HEBREWS Scripture Reading: Eph 1:13-14; 2:18; 3:16; 4:3-4, 23; 6:17; Phil 1:19; 3:3; 4:12-13; Col 1:8; 1 Thes 1:5; 4:8; 3:13; 5:19; 2 Thes 2:13; 2 Tim 1:14; Titus 3:5; Heb 3:7; 9:8; 10:15; 6:4-5; 10:29; 9:14 THE SPIRIT FOR THE BODY OF CHRIST IN EPHESIANS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians 1:13 and 14 speak of the Spirit as the seal and the pledge cf.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>2 Cor 1:22 , or we may say, the foretaste.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Ephesians 1:11 says that we were designated as an inheritance to God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are God s inheritance, possession, and property.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, God sealed us with the Spirit to testify that we are His.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the other hand, God has put His Spirit into us as the foretaste and a guarantee that God is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To be sealed proves that we are God s, and the Spirit as the pledge, the foretaste, guarantees that God is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 18 of chapter two says of the Jewish and Gentile believers, For through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Spirit is revealed in Ephesians as the uniting Spirit because this book deals with the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the Body, the Spirit is the uniting Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Ephesians 3, the Spirit is the strengthening Spirit, the Spirit who strengthens us into our inner man v. 16 , and in chapter four the Spirit is again the uniting Spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 23 says, And that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the regenerated spirit of the believers, which is mingled with the indwelling Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, this verse implies the renewing Spirit Titus 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Ephesians 6:17 mentions the sword of the Spirit, indicating the fighting Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Ephesians mentions the human spirit a number of times.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In those verses spirit should be rendered in lower case, denoting the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These verses speak of a spirit of wisdom and revelation 1:17 , the dwelling place of God in spirit 2:22 , the revelation to the holy apostles and prophets in spirit 3:5 , being filled in spirit 5:18 , and praying in spirit 6:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the apostle Paul wrote Ephesians, he had a particular burden with a certain realization and thought.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The particular thought in Ephesians is that the church is the Body of Christ composed of many redeemed ones from both the Jewish and Gentile peoples.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These redeemed ones are God s possession, property, and inheritance, so He put the Spirit as His seal on them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In ancient times God promised that He would give His Spirit to His redeemed ones.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now this Spirit has been given as a seal to prove and testify that all the redeemed ones are God s inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This seal is nothing less than God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Moreover, the seal that God puts on His redeemed ones becomes a pledge, a foretaste, a down payment, a deposit, to guarantee that God is our enjoyment and possession.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This Spirit as the seal and the foretaste unites all the redeemed ones together as the Body of Christ, of which the redeemed ones are members.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He also strengthens us within, renews us, and fills us with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then the daily walk of the redeemed ones comes out of this infilling, and He becomes the fighting Spirit, equipping us to fight the battle for God in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we look into Ephesians with this point of view, this book will become new to us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE SUPPLYING SPIRIT IN PHILIPPIANS</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Philippians 1:19 says, For I know that for me this will turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The term bountiful supply in Greek is a particular word used in ancient times to denote the leader of the chorus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The leader of the chorus was responsible for supplying all the needs of the members of the chorus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When they needed food, drink, clothing, or a dwelling place, the leader supplied them with those things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When they needed instruments and music, he also supplied them with those.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For this reason, the term can be translated as bountiful supply or all-sufficient supply.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Spirit in 1:19 is not only the Spirit of Jesus or the Spirit of Christ but the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Spirit today is no longer merely the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is the Spirit of Jesus Christ, including His divinity, His incarnation, His humanity, His human life, His suffering and death, His resurrection, His ascension, and everything He has attained and obtained.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because He is such a Spirit, He can afford us an all-sufficient supply.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Philippians 3:3 says, For we are the circumcision, the ones who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the book of Philippians, the Spirit is revealed as the supplying Spirit who affords us the all-sufficient supply and as the serving Spirit for us to serve and worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In addition, 4:12 and 13 say, I know also how to be abased, and I know how to abound; in everything and in all things I have learned the secret both to be filled and to hunger, both to abound and to lack.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These verses should be put together with 1:19.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The way Christ empowers us is by being the supplying Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If Christ were not the supplying Spirit, how could He empower us?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ is the Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17 , and it is as the Spirit that He empowers us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Philippians is a book on the Christian life and living.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Christian life is a life that always has the all-inclusive, bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, and it is a life of always serving and worshipping God by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Moreover, the supplying Spirit and the serving Spirit is the very Christ who empowers us within, in whom we can do all things.</S>
