<h2 class="head1">CHAINS OF GOLD</h2><p>Exodus 28:22 says, &ldquo;And you shall make upon the breastplate twined chains, a work of cords, of pure gold.&rdquo; These two chains of gold signify Christ&rsquo;s divine nature as the connecting element. In typology gold signifies the divine nature. The chains, no doubt, served the purpose of connecting, joining. Thus, these two chains of gold typify the divine nature of Christ as the connecting element.</p><p>Verses 22 through 27 are not easy to understand. According to verse 23, two rings of gold were put upon the two ends of the breastplate. These two ends were at the top and were connected to the shoulder-pieces. Then two ribbons, made of linen, not of gold, were attached to the two bottom ends of the breastplate and bound the breastplate to the ephod. Therefore, verse 28 says, &ldquo;And they shall bind the breastplate by its rings unto the rings of the ephod with a ribbon of blue, that it may be upon the skillfully woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate may not come loose from the ephod.&rdquo;</p><p>Verse 22 mentions the two chains of gold that connected the top ends of the breastplate to the bottom ends of the two shoulder plates. These chains were made with twined cords of gold. The word twined signifies having passed through sufferings. This indicates that Christ&rsquo;s divinity, having passed through sufferings, has become the connecting element. If there were no twined, golden cords made into chains, there would not be any connecting element. There would be nothing to join the breastplate to the shoulder plates. This necessary connecting element is Christ&rsquo;s divinity. Christ&rsquo;s divine nature is what joins us all together.</p><p>We have pointed out that the word &ldquo;twined&rdquo; signifies having passed through sufferings. Christ in His divine nature certainly has been twined; that is, He has gone through sufferings. When He lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years, the divine nature within Him was twined. It passed through a great deal of suffering, a great deal of twining work.</p><h2 class="head1">RINGS OF GOLD</h2><p>Verse 23 says, &ldquo;And you shall make upon the breastplate two rings of gold, and put the two rings upon the two ends of the breastplate.&rdquo; The two rings of gold on the two ends of the breastplate signify the Spirit of Christ as the holding element. In typology rings signify the Spirit. Now we have the chains signifying Christ&rsquo;s divinity, and the rings signifying Christ&rsquo;s Spirit. Perhaps you are wondering what is the difference between Christ&rsquo;s divinity and Christ&rsquo;s Spirit. Although they are very close, there is nevertheless some difference between them. Christ has divinity, the divine nature. He also has His Spirit, the Spirit of Christ, which is Christ Himself. Romans 8 speaks of Christ and also of the Spirit of Christ. Although it is correct to say that the Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself, there is still a difference between Christ and the Spirit of Christ. However, it is difficult for us to explain what this difference is.</p><p>In the picture of the ephod we have the chains and the rings. If we had the chains without the rings, we could not have a complete connection. The chains were the connecting element, but the rings were the holding element. When we have both the connecting and holding elements, we have the proper joining. If you consider your experience carefully in a fine, detailed way, you will realize that, on the one hand, the divine nature of Christ within you is a connecting element and that, on the other hand, the Spirit of Christ within you is a holding element. Because we have both Christ&rsquo;s divinity and Christ&rsquo;s Spirit, we have a complete joining.</p><p>Verse 24 goes on to say, &ldquo;And you shall put the two cords of gold on the two rings at the ends of the breastplate.&rdquo; The two chains of gold put on the two rings at the ends of the breastplate signify Christ&rsquo;s divine nature with Christ&rsquo;s Spirit as the connecting power.</p>
