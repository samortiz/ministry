   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE LAW OF FREEDOM Scripture Reading: Heb 8:10-11; Rom 6:14; 1 Cor 9:21, 26-27; James 1:25; 2:12; 2 Tim 1:7; 4:22 FELLOWSHIPPING CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE HEALTHY TEACHINGS IN THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous chapter we learned the definitions of the terms God s economy and godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to review the definitions of these terms not only in church meetings but also in smaller times of fellowship and even in family conversations.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Such spontaneous fellowship will be a great help to us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should not think that it is enough to hear or read a message one time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We first need to study the content of the message; then the Spirit will bring us into the experience of the message.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord has given us much new light in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because the teachings in the Lord s recovery are not ordinary shallow Christian teachings, we need to pay our full attention to them in order to fully understand and experience them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to be bathed in all the terms and healthy teachings in the Lord s recovery by making them the topic of our daily conversations.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rather than talking about low, worthless things, we should speak to one another about what we have read in the Life-study messages and other ministry books.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This will enrich our Christian life and uplift the standard of the Lord s testimony among us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Chapter 3 of this book is entitled The Lord s Recovery Being the Recovery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the Lord s recovery we do not have various ways, activities, organizations, or dissenting, divisive teachings and doctrines; rather, we have only Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These words may be easy to understand and repeat, but we need to be able to illustrate what it means practically that the Lord s recovery is nothing but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to spend time to enter into these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Chapter 2 concerns the content of the word and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The content of both the word of God in the Bible and the Spirit is Christ, His death, and His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should be able to explain that all the words in the Bible either cross us out with Christ s death or enliven us with His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, the word is our spiritual food that contains all the elements needed to kill the germs in our body and to supply us with life and strength.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every time we take the word of the Bible into us, we receive Christ, His death, and His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then the word works within us, killing us and strengthening us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We all need to fellowship about all these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although these chapters are in simple words, they are quite profound and rich.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As we fellowship concerning these matters, the Holy Spirit will work to bring us into the depths of all these truths.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then these truths will gradually be wrought into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These truths are rich food.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every time we read these chapters, we will receive something new, fresh, and refreshing because they contain the deep truths from the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, we need to fellowship concerning these matters until we fully enter into them and they are wrought into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>GRACE NOT MAKING US LAWLESS</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Romans 6:14 says, For you are not under the law but under grace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This verse does not mean that we are fully liberated to do anything we want; grace does not make us lawless.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The law referred to in this verse is the Old Testament law, the law given through Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although we certainly are not under that law today, this does not mean that God has no law toward us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God is not a lawless God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the New Testament God has imparted His law upon our hearts Heb 10:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the Old Testament it may have been possible to disregard the Ten Commandments, which were written on tablets of stone, but today God s law has been written into our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We cannot disregard this subjective law within us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, the law of the New Testament is stricter than the law of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What God does is always advancing and going higher.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Romans 6:14 does not mean that today we are not under any law; rather, it means that we are not under the Old Testament law, the objective law written on tablets of stone.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today we are under a law that is stricter and more subjective to us; it is written upon our hearts.</S>
