<p>This book is composed of six messages given by Brother Witness Lee in co-workers&rsquo; meetings held in Taipei in 1958, following a conference on how to enjoy God. The messages of that conference have been published in <em>How to Enjoy God and How to Practice the Enjoyment of God.</em> These messages were originally published in 1958 in <em>The Ministry of the Word.</em></p><br>Home | Prev | <a href="page_002.html">Next</a> </body></html>
