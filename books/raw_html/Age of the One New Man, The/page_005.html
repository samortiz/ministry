        <h2 class="head1">BEING ENCOURAGED<br />
TO BE UP TO DATE WITH THE AGE</h2>
<p>My first visit to Hualien was around the summertime in 1951 or 1952. I traveled from Kaohsiung to Taitung and then to Hualien. I did not take the perilous Suhua Highway, because I must take care of my life for the sake of the Lord&rsquo;s commission. My initial desire was to have contact with a few brothers. However, the brothers gathered a good number of saints, who requested to hear a message. After this visit a church was established in Hualien. I later visited Hualien one or two more times. Once in the month of April in 1957, I brought a group of overseas saints from England, the United States, and Denmark, as well as some saints from Taipei. We went from Kaohsiung to Hualien not by train or car; we took the risk of flying in an airplane. We thank the Lord for His preservation. After the conference in Hualien, I brought all the visiting saints who were with me back to Taipei.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Up to Date, Not Stagnant</h2>
<p>It has been twenty years since my last visit. When I got off the airplane this time, I was surprised at the new Hualien airport; it is decorated with marble inside and outside. Not only so, the roads and infrastructure in Hualien have improved. However, the church in Hualien is not up to date. Ten years ago there were more than one hundred people meeting here, but after ten years the number does not exceed two hundred. At the beginning of this chapter, we saw that God uses the political situation to pave the way for the spread of the gospel. All things work together for the church. Hence, the church should not be stagnant; rather, it should utilize the situation and be up to date.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Seizing the Opportunity to Buy Land</h2>
<p>I encourage the saints in Hualien to do two things for the spread of the Lord&rsquo;s testimony in this place. First, you need to buy one thousand ping [Editor&rsquo;s note: a ping is approximately 35.57 square feet] of land. You must not be satisfied with two hundred ping of land. In the future you will regret that you did not buy enough land. If the land is bought this year, in three years it will double in price. The sooner we buy the land, the more we will save. For the Lord&rsquo;s testimony in Hualien, the brothers must be up to date. In the future Hualien will become a major city on the east coast of Taiwan. When there is an opportunity, we should buy a large piece of land in preparation for the spread of the Lord&rsquo;s testimony.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Aggressively Gaining People</h2>
<p>Second, we need to aggressively gain people. I hope that by the end of the year there would be one hundred young people meeting in the church in Hualien. The number of young people in the church in Hualien is much smaller than the number of young people in the church in Taipei. Hence, the young people must pray desperately to the Lord. They should say, &ldquo;Lord, in the last two months of this year, I must bring two people to the church.&rdquo; Those who are under twenty-six years of age must answer the Lord&rsquo;s call to bring in two people this year. We should not be concerned about bringing in false believers. Some people are initially false believers before they become genuine believers. I grew up in a Christian family. Before the age of nineteen, I was a false believer. Then I became a genuine believer. Therefore, we do not need to worry. By January 1 of next year each young person should bring in two people. We need to learn to give an account to the Lord. Currently, there are about thirty young people in the meetings. If everyone brings two people into the church life, by next January there will be one hundred young people in the meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Young People Being Raised Up by the Lord<br />
to Bear the Responsibility of the Church</h2>
<p>The rest of the saints should be encouraged to run once the young people begin to run. More middle-aged saints and young saints must be raised up to bear the responsibility of the church. I would ask the older saints to forgive me for saying a direct word. Because we are older in age, we should recognize the current situation and step aside. Every father is the same. Even when his son is almost fifty years old, and he has become a grandfather, he still sees his son as a child who does not know how to do things; hence, he continues to do things himself. The older saints should step aside so that the younger ones can take over. The younger ones may not know how to do things or may not do them as well as the older brothers. However, the more they do, the better they will become.</p>
<p>I hope that in the near future the Lord will raise up young adults between the ages of twenty-five and thirty-five to be elders in the church in Hualien. When those in this age group become elders, I believe that the number in the meetings will reach five hundred. Then we will need a meeting hall. We need to be wise and aware of the current situation, that is, aware of this age. We know that this is the age of the one new man. As the one new man, we must be up to date with the age of the one new man. I hope that from today the church will be completely new. This newness begins with the younger generation. In order for a family to be new, it must begin with the younger generation. Hence, every young person must take courage, pray, drink the living water, and have a fresh beginning. Then the Lord will have a way to gain a strong and bright testimony in Hualien.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
