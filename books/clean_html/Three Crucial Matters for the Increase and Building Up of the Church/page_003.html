<h2 class="head1">ALL THE LORD&rsquo;S LOVERS BEING FULL-TIMERS</h2>
<p>Every lover of the Lord should be a full-time serving one. Some drop their jobs to serve full time, and others serve full time while keeping their jobs. Some people are able to make money, but they are unable to expound the Bible. If we ask them to speak a few words for the Lord, they are unable to speak a clear word. Other people are the opposite; they are unable to make money. Therefore, those who are able to make money should make money for the Lord, and those who can expound the Bible and who have a gift to speak and teach should drop their jobs and serve full time.</p>
<p>Gospelizing Taiwan in five years is not an empty dream. If we produce five hundred full-timers every year, we will have two thousand five hundred full-timers in five years. These two thousand five hundred full-time serving ones will need more than two thousand five hundred money-making full-timers to support them. Even though God is omnipotent, He still needs man&rsquo;s cooperation. A money-making full-timer should subtract from his earnings whatever amount his family needs to live on and place the remaining amount on the altar for the Lord&rsquo;s use. If he does not practice this, he is not a full-timer. We are the true Israelites. When the Israelites were leaving Egypt, God told them to plunder the riches of Egypt (Exo. 3:22; 12:35-36). If our heart is for the Lord, He will certainly bless us. We should fear being enticed by money so that we are unwilling to give to the Lord. If five thousand people in Taiwan are willing to live a life of giving their all to the Lord, it will certainly be possible to gospelize and truthize Taiwan.</p>
<p>When I gave up my job to serve the Lord full time in 1933, there were only two or three thousand people in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. These believers gave their all. In order to save money for the Lord&rsquo;s use, some people would walk instead of taking the electric tram. We were supported by what the believers gave. Sometimes we would receive a gift of one dollar when it seemed that we were about to eat our last meal. The environment in Taiwan today is rich; if we are willing to give everything to the Lord, He will have a way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR NEED BEING TO GO FORTH TO SPEAK THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>The educational standard in Taiwan has been raised because education is compulsory for everyone. This has given every person, regardless of his occupation, a desire to learn the true meaning of human life. Christianity has lost the truth and has fallen into methods, traditions, superstitions, and shallowness. Most people are tired of hearing the simple and shallow teachings about going to heaven or hell. They want to hear the truth concerning the meaning of human life. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has the truth, but we need people to go out to dispense the truth.</p>
<p>We are happy that many of the young brothers and sisters pray using terms such as <em>God&rsquo;s dispensing, God&rsquo;s New Testament economy,</em> and <em>divine transformation.</em> Even the older saints in their fifties and sixties can pray with these terms. We are also encouraged that the saints do not sing common hymns. The labor of the ministry has not been in vain because a number of spiritual things have entered into the saints. The believers in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are not the only ones who need the truth. The believers in Christianity and the unbelievers need the truth. First Timothy 2:4 says that God &ldquo;desires all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth.&rdquo; How will all men come to the full knowledge of the truth if we do not go forth to speak? Therefore, we must see that our commission is to send forth the gospel and the truth as quickly as possible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH NEEDING<br />
TO BEGET, NOURISH, AND TEACH</h2>
<p>There are three important matters for the spread and increase of the church, namely, begetting, nourishing, and teaching. Every country is founded upon its society, and the soundness of a society depends upon begetting, nourishing, and teaching. The church, as a heavenly society, also needs begetting, nourishing, and teaching. The church begets by preaching the gospel. We need a plan to preach the gospel in every school, in every home of every neighborhood, to every level of society, and in every village. After gaining people, we need to nourish them. In society nourishing takes place in the homes; in the church nourishing should take place in the home meetings. I hope that there will be a home meeting in the home of every brother and sister. If there are two thousand family units in Taipei, there should be two thousand home meetings. Every home should be for begetting and nourishing.</p>
<p>Taiwan places much emphasis on education, and everyone admires this. Some people in America showed me a cartoon in which a Chinese boy was studying while his mother was preparing a meal for him, his father was fanning him, and his younger brother was massaging his back. The entire family was helping him to study. Some Americans say that education is the current Chinese idol. Parents in Taiwan economize on their food and clothing in order to save money to educate their children.</p>
<p>In the church life we have <em>Truth Lessons</em> for our education. We need a change in our concept to emphasize truth education in the church. According to our old system there were four kinds of meetings. There was the big meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day that attracted people with messages. Every Lord&rsquo;s Day people asked who was giving the message that day. They loved to listen to the brothers who spoke eloquently. There was the meeting for preaching the gospel, which was held whenever there was a need to preach the gospel. There was the bread-breaking meeting to remember the Lord, and there was the prayer meeting. We had these four kinds of meetings every week of every year, but we did not beget or nourish many people, and we did not have sufficient education.</p>
<p>When the work began in Taipei more than thirty years ago, as soon as a person was saved, he was placed in a home meeting. We also had three or four months of training every year. But when I returned in 1984, there were only these four kinds of meetings. There was a lack of teaching the truth for education and a lack of nourishing in the home meetings. For this reason, my burden is to hold a training to train full-timers, elders, and co-workers to do three things: preach the gospel, build up the home meetings, and teach the truth. This is to beget, nourish, and teach.</p>
<p>If we do not intensify our effort in these three things&mdash;preaching the gospel, building up home meetings, and teaching the truth&mdash;the church will not be strong. Some people say that the home meetings will not work. Of course, if we do not go and practice, they will never work. Whether or not something works depends on our willingness to practice. For example, the freeways in Taiwan are flat roads, but when they were being built, many obstacles needed to be overcome. The people who built the freeways needed to cut through mountains and build bridges over rivers. If we want the church to be strong and the Lord&rsquo;s work to spread, we need a group of laboring ones to rise up to preach the gospel, build up home meetings, and teach the brothers and sisters how to learn the truth.</p>
<p>One brother invited a couple to attend a home meeting. In the home meeting they read portions from <em>The Living Needed for Building Up the Small Group Meetings.</em> The husband prayed to receive the Lord, and a brother baptized him in the bathtub. While the husband was being baptized, the sisters preached the gospel to his wife, and she also was baptized. This newly baptized couple came to the meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. This is the function of the home meetings. If the church in Taipei has four hundred home meetings functioning in this way, there will certainly be the increase. A person who believes and is baptized as a result of attending a meeting in a believer&rsquo;s home will remember this experience for his entire life.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we must emphasize <em>Truth Lessons.</em> There is a locality near Taipei that holds two classes for <em>Truth Lessons</em> at four different times on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. In one day they have eight classes in which they perfect the saints to teach the truth. All teachers know that teaching a matter, rather than simply studying it, is the best way to gain a thorough understanding. If we study something by ourselves, we can be careless in our understanding, but when we teach others, we are forced to understand the material thoroughly. <em>Truth Lessons</em> should be studied in a group. This method of teaching will enable us to enter into the truth.</p>
<p>Some people say that <em>Truth Lessons</em> are too deep and difficult to understand. If a person reads a lesson several times, he will spontaneously understand it. When I was young, I read the statement &ldquo;The way of great learning depends on developing the bright virtue,&rdquo; and of course, I did not understand it. However, I later understood it. We should never demean the truth. The elderly brothers and sisters are able to understand matters such as the divine dispensing, transformation, conformation, and the essential and economical Spirit. In the same principle, when we preach the gospel, we should not speak a shallow word because we fear that people will not understand us otherwise. We must speak the excellent truths in the Bible. If people do not understand the truth today, they will understand after they hear the truth over a period of time. Our responsibility is to preach until every home knows the truth. Then everyone will know the truth and every family will speak the truth.</p>
<p>May all the churches in Taiwan practice begetting, nourishing, and teaching for the increase and building up of the church. To practice these three things is to preach the gospel, to build up the home meetings, and to teach the truth.</p>
