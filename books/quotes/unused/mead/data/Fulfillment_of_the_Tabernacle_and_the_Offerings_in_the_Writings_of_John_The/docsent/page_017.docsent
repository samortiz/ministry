   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>While the Lord Jesus was on earth as God's tabernacle, no one was able to enter into Him, because the way had not been prepared and the entrance was not open.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For this reason, after thirty-three and a half years on earth, He suddenly told His disciples that He was going away.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This troubled the disciples, for they thought that He was leaving them forever.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then the Lord revealed to them that His going was actually His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It seems that the Lord was saying to them, "If I do not go away, I would only be here among you.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You would not be able to enter into Me, and I would not have a way to come into you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, I need to go away through death and resurrection to accomplish redemption for you and to open the way for you to come into Me."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Through death and resurrection the Lord opened the gate and prepared the way for us to come into Him as the living, moving tabernacle, the very God embodied in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, after dying to accomplish redemption, the Lord changed His form and in resurrection became the pneumatic Christ, the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This makes it possible for Him to enter into us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, in John 14 the Lord also seemed to be saying to the disciples, "On the day of My resurrection you will know that I am in the Father, that you are in Me, and that I am in you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today I am still the tabernacle among you, but outside of you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You are outside of Me, and you have no way to come into Me. Neither is there a way for Me to enter into you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the reason that I must die to accomplish redemption and open the way that you may enter into Me as the tabernacle and that the Triune God, embodied in Me, may enter into you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then where I am, there you will be also John 14:3; 17:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You will know that I am in the Father, that you are in Me, and that I am in you."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the day of His resurrection, the Lord appeared to His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although the door was shut, He suddenly and mysteriously appeared.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then He breathed on them and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit" John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this way He entered into the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In John 1 we have the Lord as the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, and the Dove.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Dove is one with the Lamb, becoming the Dove-Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Dove-Lamb is another aspect of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The tabernacle is the embodiment of the Word, and the Word is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now the Triune God in the Word, the Word in the tabernacle, and the tabernacle through the Lamb with the Dove may enter into people to regenerate them and transform them into precious stones to be built up together as God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's house today is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But the consummation of the church will be the New Jerusalem, the tabernacle of God in its consummation, in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the story of God's economy, a story that is altogether wrapped up with the Person of the living Word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The living Word and the written Word are one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The living Word is the reality of the written Word, and the written Word is the definition of the living Word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The living Word said that in Moses, the Psalms, and the prophets many things were written concerning Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Luke 24 He expounded to some of the disciples the things in the Scriptures concerning Himself v. 27 . By this we see that in the Bible we have the story of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ is the Word, and the Bible also is the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Word was and still is the eternal and the living Word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As we have seen, the living Word is also the written Word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When Christ, the living Word spoke, this spoken Word was the rhema, which is spirit and life to us John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, the universal story is a story of the Word, and this Word is the universal economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this economy we can see a Person, the living Word, with the written Word and the spoken Word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Triune God is embodied in Christ, and Christ is embodied in the flesh, and this flesh is the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The embodiment of God becomes His dwelling and our dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Simultaneously, this incarnate Word is the totality of all the offerings to accomplish redemption and prepare the way for us to enter into God and for God to enter into us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After accomplishing redemption, He became the life-giving Spirit to come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When He came into us, all the elements included in the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit also came into us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These elements include God, man, incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now the divine life with the divine nature has been imparted into our being to make us stones and to build us together to be the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Eventually, the churches in the different localities will consummate in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The six signs in John 1 the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house of God cover the entire central line of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This economy is altogether a story of the Word, a story of the eternal Word, the living Word, the written Word, and the spoken Word that is spirit and life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>May we all understand the story of this Word.</S>
