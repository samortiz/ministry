   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In this message, entitled "The Saints' Deeper Experience of God in the Identification with Christ," we will consider Psalms 90 through 92.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As we read these psalms, we need to seek what they reveal about the deeper experience of God and about the identification with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Psalm 90 opens with a word concerning God as our dwelling place: "O Lord, You have been our dwelling place/In all generations."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To be sure, the Bible is the only book that tells us that God can be our dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Psalm 42:1 speaks of panting after God as a hart pants after streams of water.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In preaching the gospel, we may tell others that they can drink, eat, and breathe the Lord Jesus, but have you ever told others that they can dwell in the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Dwelling in the Lord is deeper than drinking Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many of us, after coming into the church life, can testify of drinking, eating, and breathing Christ, but have you ever had the thought of dwelling in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Psalms is not a book on good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Psalms is a book on Christ a book on drinking Christ, eating Christ, breathing Christ, and dwelling in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ is the living water to quench our thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Psalm 36 the river of God's pleasures is for our drinking, and the fatness of God's house is for our eating.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can drink, eat, and breathe the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now in Psalm 90 we see that we can also dwell in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Psalm 90 was written by Moses, the one who gave the law with all the statutes and ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In verse 1 this lawgiver, who was quite old, proclaimed that God is our dwelling place in all generations.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then in verse 2 he went on to say, "Before the mountains were brought forth,/And before You produced the earth and the world,/Indeed from eternity to eternity, You are God."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This was a new thought, something altogether unprecedented.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Have you ever considered this matter of God's being our dwelling place?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From my youth I was taught by Bible teachers regarding the abiding in Christ mentioned in John 15.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord Jesus said, "Abide in Me and I in you" v. 4a . At that time I understood the word "abide" as meaning to stay or to remain, not to dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But eventually I learned that the Greek word translated "abide" means not simply to remain but also to dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To abide in Christ is to dwell in Him, not just remain or stay in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we dwell in our house, we have our life and our living there.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means that our life and living are altogether wrapped up with our dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We spend more money on our house than on anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some people really love their house and all the furniture in it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, our house indicates the kind of person we are.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Scotland, for example, the people are known for the excellent way they care for their houses.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to Moses' word in Psalm 90:1, our house, our dwelling place, is the Triune God as our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Dwelling in God is the deeper experience of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we experience the Triune God to the degree that we take Him as our dwelling place, we have the deeper experience of God.</S>
