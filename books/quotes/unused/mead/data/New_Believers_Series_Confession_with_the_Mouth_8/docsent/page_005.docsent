   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>How can we overcome this feeling of shame?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must deal with it from two aspects:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the one hand, we have to realize that when the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, He bore our sins as well as our shame.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When our Lord bore our sins, He suffered great humiliation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today, in the eyes of God, it is only proper that we suffer humiliation from men.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The humiliation we suffer before man can never be compared with the humiliation our Lord suffered on the cross for us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, we should not be surprised at humiliation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should know that we belong to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the other hand, there is a good hymn which says, "Our shyness is like the early morning sky disowning the sun!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But the Lord radiates the divine light which illuminates our consciences which are as dark as the night."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since the Lord has been gracious to us and has redeemed us, being ashamed of confessing Him is like the early morning sky being ashamed of the illumination of the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today the Lord has graced us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He has redeemed us and preserved us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He will even bring us to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yet we consider it a shame to confess Him!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If that is a shame, then all the grace we have received should also be considered a shame to us, and we should deny it all!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord has done so much for us, and yet we feel ashamed of confessing Him!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How can this be?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should feel shameful for such things as carousing, drunkenness, unrestrained dissipation, works of darkness, sinning, and evil works.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord has delivered us from all these.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should feel glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How can we have a sense of shame?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is not shameful for us to confess the Lord; it is glorious and joyous for us to confess Him!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are those who will never perish, who will never be condemned or judged by God, and who will never have to depart from the glorious face of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are those who follow the Lamb and who will always be with Him Rev 14:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is altogether wrong for others to plant the seed of shame in us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should stand up boldly and say that we belong to God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should rejoice and glory in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By nature Peter was a strong-willed person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He wanted to distinguish himself among the disciples and to be ahead of others in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But one day he denied the Lord and became like a little mouse.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When he was questioned, he was afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Humanly speaking, Peter was a "hero" and a born leader among the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Yet he trembled even before others tried to take his life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He trembled and swore when all that was said to him was, "This man was with Jesus the Nazarene."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This was indeed too poor.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All those who refuse to confess the Lord are poor.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Peter was most shameful; it was a shame for him to deny the Lord Matt 26:69-75 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All those who are too shy to open their mouths are full of shame.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The really noble ones are the ones who confess their allegiance to Jesus of Nazareth, even at the point of being burned at the stake or thrown into the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They may be beaten, burned alive, or thrown into the lions' den, but they still proclaim, "I belong to Jesus the Nazarene."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the most glorious thing in the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The most shameful ones are those who are ashamed to confess the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This kind of people are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They will even loathe themselves and be ashamed of themselves!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The most shameful thing is for a person to despise himself and be ashamed of what he has.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, we should not have any fear or shame.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All those who learn to follow the Lord should learn to confess Him boldly before man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If light is shameful and darkness glorious, if holiness is shameful and sin glorious, if spirituality is shameful and carnality glorious, and if following the Lord is shameful and following man glorious, then we would rather choose shame.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We would rather suffer humiliation with Christ as Moses did, which humiliation is far better than the glories of men Heb 11:26 .</S>
