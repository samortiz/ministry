This book was written to all those who call on the name of the Lord Jesus (1 Cor. 1:2). When Paul was Saul of Tarsus, he received authority to persecute and even kill the believers. In Acts 9 his intention was to bind all those who called on the name of the Lord. This indicates that the Christians in ancient times were the calling ones. There was no need to tell others that they were Christians; neither was there a need for others to discern who the Christians were. It was easy to tell because they were the calling people. They called on the name of Jesus. We must be today's calling people, all day long calling on the name of the Lord. When you call on His name, you are in the Spirit. When you call on His name, you will be filled with the Spirit, saturated with the Spirit, permeated with the Spirit, and soaked with the Spirit. When you call on the name of Jesus, the Spirit will be poured out upon you. Within and without we shall be full of the Spirit.</P><P>Some meetings may be started simply by calling on the name of the Lord for several minutes. The Lord hates deadness more than anything. Nothing is as defiling as death. Although I do not encourage you to be beside yourself, I would like to impress you and even to charge you to call on the name of the Lord. Those who do can testify that it certainly makes a difference. I expect that the time will come when we shall all be accustomed to calling on the name of the Lord Jesus all the time. Before you read the Bible, try calling on the name of the Lord Jesus for a few minutes. What a difference it will make in your reading of the Scriptures! Although it will not change the Bible, it will change you. You will be living, and your spirit will be stirred up. Mere knowledge is useless, but calling, "O Lord Jesus" is useful. Do you know the way to receive the Spirit? There is no need to wrinkle your brow or fast for three days. The Lord never predestined you to do that. Rather, He destined you to call on the Lord. In His economy He has already accomplished everything for the inward and outward experiences of the Spirit, for the indwelling of the Spirit, and for the outpouring of the Spirit. Now He is here as the all-inclusive Spirit. This Spirit includes the Savior, the Redeemer, and the Life-giver. He is waiting not for you to fast or to pray, but to call on His name. He is waiting for you to breathe the name of Jesus and to drink of life indeed. I encourage you to try it. All the local churches must be calling churches, and every saint in the Lord's recovery must be one who calls on the name of the Lord. We have been called to call on Him.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_025.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_027.html">Next</a> </body></html>
