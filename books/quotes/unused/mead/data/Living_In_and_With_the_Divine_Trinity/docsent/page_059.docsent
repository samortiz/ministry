   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE LIVING WITH THE DIVINE TRINITY 3 Scripture Reading: Phil 2:13; 1:19-21a; 2:15-16a; 3:10-14; 4:8, 12-13</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we want to see the revelation concerning our living with the Divine Trinity in the book of Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>GOD OPERATING IN US</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Philippians 2:13 says, "For it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Everything that is covered in the book of Philippians is under God's operating move.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God has a move on this earth, and He moves by His operating.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to see God's operating in us, it would be helpful for us to have a brief review of the book of Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Philippians is a book concerning our experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Chapter one shows us that we need to live and magnify Christ for Him to be our living and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Chapter two shows that we need to take Christ as our pattern and hold Him forth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In chapter three we see that we need to pursue and gain Christ as our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Chapter four shows us that we need to have Christ as our secret of sufficiency.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verse 12 of chapter four, Paul declares that he has learned the secret.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He uses a metaphor concerning a person being initiated into a secret society with instruction in its rudimentary principles.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Actually, this "secret society" in chapter four is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In conclusion, we can say that in chapter one of Philippians, Christ is our living and expression; in chapter two He is our pattern; in chapter three He is our goal; and in chapter four He is our secret.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All four chapters reveal a certain aspect of Christ for us to experience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Chapter two gives us the overall thought, the all-embracing thought, the all-inclusive thought, of the book of Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This thought is that the moving God is operating in us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whatever Christ is to us is for the operating of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should care for God's operating in us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our God is living, moving, and operating in you and me continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God's operating in us can be compared to our blood circulation or to the circulation of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the flow of blood within us stops, our life will stop.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The circulation of blood is life operating in us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The flow of electricity is the operating of the electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If the flow of electricity stops in a building, there will be no light there.</S>
