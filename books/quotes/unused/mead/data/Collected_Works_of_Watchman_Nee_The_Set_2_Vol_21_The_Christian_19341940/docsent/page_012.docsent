   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RESULT OF CONFESSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I must confess that although I am a preacher of the Word, I am also ashamed to confess.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, I can tell you some of my past experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I studied once in a church parochial school.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On every examination, I usually scored a grade between ninety and one hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>My average grade in the school was about ninety-nine.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But I could never do well in the class that taught the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I was not interested in the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>My grade-point average was always pulled down by this subject.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the third year, I still did not like this subject.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At that time I was not yet a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The teacher would always tell everyone that a certain student did well in every subject except this one, and that it would be nice if the student did well in that particular subject as well.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, I determined to study and prepare for the Bible course.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That year we were on the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I spent a few months studying it, and by the time the examination came, I decided to do well.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I wrote down the crucial points of the book on my arms and covered them with my long-sleeved shirt.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I gave the right answer on many questions, but still my score was only a little over seventy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Prior to that I had received grades of only forty to fifty.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Later, I was saved, and I had no peace about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I dared not confess it, for if I did, the principal and the teachers would think that I did the same thing with the other subjects.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I was afraid that the school would expel me because the school rules stated that anyone caught cheating would be expelled.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Moreover, I had already voiced my disagreement with the Anglican Church concerning certain truths, and the principal was not very happy with me.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I was afraid that if I was expelled, I would be too ashamed to face my parents.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I struggled for many days.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the end, I realized that I would have no peace if I did not confess.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The conscience can go to sleep, but it will never die.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As a result, I wrote a letter to the principal and made the confession.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Later, the principal called me and told me that he forgave my offense on behalf of the school.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Brothers and sisters, our conscience often can go to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But after it wakes up, it will continue to remind us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every unconfessed sin is an unremoved scar.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Your conscience can be suppressed, but it will not shut up and be silent forever.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only those who confess their sins will obtain mercy, and only those who confess their sins will be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The taste of sin is the taste of hell.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are often like David, who said, "When I kept silent, my bones wasted away/Through my groaning all day long./For day and night Your hand/Was heavy upon me;/My life sap was dried up/As in the drought of summer" Psa 32:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, after he confessed his sins, he said, "You surround me with the ringing shouts of deliverance" v. 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Previously, we have mentioned that if one does not make confessions, he will not have the proper feeling for sin.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now we must also say that if one does not make confessions, he will not have the proper feeling of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some have wondered why some feel joyful after they are saved, but others do not have joy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some do not have joy because they have not testified.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Others do not have joy because they have not obeyed God in certain areas, or because they are not willing to give up some matters.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Still others do not have joy because they are unwilling to confess their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The joy of confession is a great joy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once I was conducting a conference in Changchow, and the principal of a school wanted to bring some elementary school students to my meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I was somewhat reluctant to agree because I was afraid that they would disturb the meeting and distract others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But the principal was an experienced man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He said that there is power in the gospel, and that perhaps a few among them would be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Eventually they were allowed to come.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Afterward, one teacher from that school came and told me that something had happened in their school.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I asked what it was, and he said that a wave of confession had swept through the school.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He told me that one child was only seven or eight years old.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He and a few other children had once picked loquats from the loquat tree next to the principal's office without permission.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Now he realized that this was a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But he was afraid of the principal and dared not confess his sin.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When he refused to confess, he did not have the peace.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He cried for two days, and in the end he confessed to the principal.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Confession is necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If a sin is not confessed, it will follow you all your life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Moses said that "your sin will find you out" Num 32:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Sin does not sit still; it does not remain at a distance from us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Sin will follow us and find us out.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The teacher I mentioned earlier told me similar stories.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>One child was eleven or twelve years old.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Three or four years earlier, he had seen some of his friends buying candy at the entrance of the school.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He did not have any money himself, but it occurred to him that a few pennies were lying on the desk of his teacher's bedroom.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He went to see whether or not the teacher was there so he could take the money to buy some candy.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He went and looked, and sure enough, the teacher was not there.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He took six pennies and bought himself some candy.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Now he felt sorry for his sin.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He wanted to repay what he took, but he did not have the money.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>So he went to his sister and asked for six pennies.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>His sister asked for the reason, but he would not tell her, pleading only that he needed it, and that he could not get by without it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>His sister eventually gave him the money, but followed him to find out what he was doing.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He took the money to the teacher and said, "Three or four years ago, I took six pennies from your room to buy candies.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Now I would like to return this money to you."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When I heard this story, I mentioned it in my message the very next day.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>After the meeting, a few in the audience who were judges came to me and said, "If things go according to what you have said, there will be no need for judges anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If man returns what he has stolen, there will be no need for courts anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Although we have not seen much merit in Christianity, the few things that you mentioned are enough to show us the distinction of Christianity."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Confession brings not only peace, but joy as well.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Not only does it bring joy, but it wins back the ones whom one has offended.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Sometimes our hard-hearted friends will acknowledge with tears that Jesus is their Savior when we confess with tears our sins and acknowledge that Jesus is our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I have experienced this myself.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If it were not for Christ's sake, and if there were no Christ, no one on earth would do such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Brothers and sisters, if there is some sin in you, you should confess it immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is not an easy thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Sometimes I struggled for a few weeks and even for a few months.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>At times I struggled for half a year.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>You may be better than I am, but I have to tell you that the year after I was saved, I confessed at least a hundred times to people.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Have you offended anyone in anything?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Other than giving us peace and joy and winning people back to ourselves, confession can do another thing: it can be a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Without confession, there is no testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If I do not confess my sins, my audience will wonder if a person such as I can give a message.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We must confess our own sins, and we must condemn ourselves for our sins more than we condemn others.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Only then will we have a good testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We must acknowledge that our sins are sins and that they are wrong before we can persuade others not to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We have to confess our own sins before we can testify to others.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If we do not confess our sins now, we will not be able to touch others, and we will not have a proper testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>RECOMPENSE</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Confession is one thing, and recompense is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Is there anything that has ended up in your house?</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Is there anything that you have stolen?</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Is there anything that is not yours, but has become yours?</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Is there anything that you have secured by improper means?</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Is there anything that you have picked up from the street, or any debt that you have not repaid?</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Are you willing to clear up these things at the first available opportunity?</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>If you are not willing to do this, God will not bless you.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Many Christians are too negligent about these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>According to Leviticus, not only should we pay back what we owe, but we should also add one-fifth to it 6:1-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>This means that we should not only repay, but we should also repay a little more.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We must never allow others to suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>As Christians, we should only allow ourselves to suffer loss from others.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>If we cannot make the recompense now, we still have to find a chance to do it later.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>If the person who has suffered the loss is no longer present, you can hand the recompense over to his relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>The ordinance in the Old Testament says that if a person's relatives are not there, one can give it to the priest.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>But if the person is still alive, the priest cannot accept the recompense.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>The same is true today.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>In Fukien there was a maid who had stolen about sixty dollars worth of goods from her master.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Later she believed in the Lord and felt that this was a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>She proceeded to save about seventy dollars for recompense.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>One day she took this money to a worker of the Lord and told him to accept it and use it for God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>The brother asked if her master was still around, and she said that he was.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>The brother then said, "Why don't you return this money to him?"</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Then he told her solemnly, "God does not need a thief's money for His work."</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>If I had been there, I would have said the same thing to her.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>If a person has sinned against anyone in material possessions, he should find that same person and make the recompense.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>If that person is not around any longer, he should look for his relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>If he does not have any relatives, the recompense can go to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Brothers and sisters, may God dig deeper in us.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Does Acts 19:19 not tell us that those who believed burned improper books worth fifty thousand pieces of silver?</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>The book of James also tells us that we have to confess our sins to one another 5:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>You are not responsible for the sins that you do not remember.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>But you have to be responsible for the sins that you do remember.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>May no one wait until tomorrow to obey God's word.</S>
