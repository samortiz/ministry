   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIVING UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1934 I was invited to give a conference in Ping-Yang, Chekiang Province.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At the time I was suffering from a serious ulcer, and all the saints knew this.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One day the saints asked a brother to prepare steamed buns for me.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When I saw the bright, shiny buns, I knew that they were not fully cooked.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I was worried, because half-cooked buns are bad for people with ulcers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, I could not refuse the buns, so I ate a few bites.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I knew that if I ate a whole raw bun, I would not be able to give the message that night.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The brother who prepared the buns kept asking me to eat and even removed the other food from my plate.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If I became angry with him, I would have been unable to give the message that night.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, I turned in the depth of my being to experience the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But I still had to eat the buns, so I changed my way of eating and chewed the raw bun until it became very soft, and then I swallowed it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This example shows that things are not always convenient when we go out in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must learn to live under the shadow of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When Brother Watchman Nee was about twenty years old, he was invited to speak in Hsuchow, Anhwei Province.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His hosts prepared a Western-style bed that was made of wire netting, but they put only a sheet and a pillow on the netting without a mattress or blankets.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Brother Nee slept the whole night on the wire-bed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He did not say anything to his host.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He could not even sleep on the floor, because it was a mud floor.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is to bear the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When people found out about the bed, they said, This Mr. Nee preaches the gospel at a young age, and he is truly bearing the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Brother Nee could have requested bedding, but how would this have affected his testimony of a crucified living?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We can request what is rightfully ours, but we will not have the experience of dying with Christ in His crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we go out for the propagation, we should all be witnesses of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A witness of Christ is a person who daily lives under the shadow of the cross by being in death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Stanza two of Hymns, #631 says, If I d have Christ formed within me, / I must breathe my final breath, / Live within the Cross s shadow, / Put my soul-life e er to death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The chorus says, If no death, no life, / If no death, no life; / Life from death alone arises; / If no death, no life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we go out to spread the gospel, we are spreading God s kingdom; that is, we are spreading Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To spread Christ means that Christ is lived out through us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we daily live a crucified and resurrected life under the shadow of the cross, Christ can be lived out from us, and life can flow out from us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Prayer: Lord, You are the One sending us out to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We cannot bear fruit, but You can.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is only through Your death and resurrection that we can accomplish anything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>O Lord, we look to You for the sake of the brothers and sisters who are going out.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We ask that wherever they go and with whomever they coordinate, they would pass through death and resurrection; they would die daily and be in resurrection to enjoy You, experience You, live You out, and flow You out to others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the blessing we want for them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are not asking for outward prosperity or for the success of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We want You to have a way to go forth from us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Lord, we bless them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We look to You and wait on You on their behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We pray that You will cause them to enjoy You bountifully as the crucified and resurrected Lord, as their life and their bountiful supply within, so that they will not have any lack or shortage, but rather they would experience Your riches every day.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Lord, we pray that when the outward environment is difficult, You will make their inward enjoyment sweeter.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We know that the experience You give us and the coordination You arrange for us are for us to know You and Your resurrection power so that we would stay in the mold of Your death and be daily conformed to Your death.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Lord, as You are leading us to go forth this time, we pray that You would cause us to receive grace and blessing and that You would also cause us to glorify You.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Enable us to gain a profit, that is, to gain You as our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Lord, may this spread not only be the going forth of the gospel but even more the going forth of Yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We pray that You would go forth to fill the island of Taiwan, including every town and every village.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When people see the gospel vans and the ambassadors of the gospel, may they think of You and smell Your fragrance.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>May their inward being long for You, be inclined toward You, and receive You.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Lord, bless Taiwan, and bless every village and every citizen in Taiwan through these brothers and sisters who are going out for the spread of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Cause Your name to be known to every family and every household in Taiwan so that they will receive You and be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Use the brothers and sisters to bring Your gospel to every home.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Through their speaking, singing, praying, and calling on Your name in the homes, kindle the fire of the gospel in all the villages in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>May Your presence be with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Propagate Yourself, shame Your enemy, eliminate all the superstitions and heresies, shatter all the idols, and bind the evil one behind the idols.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Lord, we declare Your lordship.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Be King and reign over the island of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>May the truth and freedom reign.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Lord, hear our prayer, execute our prayer, and pour out Your blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Amen.</S>
