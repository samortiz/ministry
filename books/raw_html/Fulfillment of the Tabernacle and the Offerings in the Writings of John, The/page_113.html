<h2 class=head2>The Sin Offering</h2><p>Let us now consider how these five offerings are fulfilled in the cases recorded in chapters three through eleven of the Gospel of John. With the case of Nicodemus in John 3, we have the sin offering. Nicodemus was a learned, aged, experienced, moral, religious, and God-fearing gentleman. According to his opinion of himself, he may not have been sinful. In a sense, Nicodemus was not sinful outwardly. However, he certainly was sinful inwardly. This was the reason the Lord Jesus spoke to him concerning the brass serpent (v. 14). It was as if the Lord Jesus said to Nicodemus, “Nicodemus, you are very good in your outward behavior. But you still need Me to be the brass serpent as your substitute so that your serpentine nature may be dealt with. Nicodemus, you may say that you are good in your conduct and character, but you cannot say that you are good in your nature. In nature, Nicodemus, you are serpentine. You have been bitten by the old serpent, and his poison has been injected into your being. Therefore, in the sight of God, you are serpentine. As a teacher of the Jews, you must know chapter twenty-one of the book of Numbers. That chapter says that your forefathers offended God and as a result they were bitten by serpents. In the sight of God, they all became serpents who were dying. When Moses cried to God on their behalf, God told Moses to lift up a brass serpent on a pole. That brass serpent had the form of a serpent, but it did not have the nature of a serpent. But that serpent became a substitute for the people to bear their judgment. Whoever looked at that brass serpent was made alive. Nicodemus, I am the reality of that brass serpent. As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must I, the Son of Man, be lifted up, so that whoever believes in Me may have eternal life.”<p>After the Lord spoke to Nicodemus regarding this matter, Nicodemus had nothing further to say. He understood the Lord’s word. In John 3 the brass serpent lifted up on a pole was the sin offering. This offering does not bear our sins; instead, it deals with the sin in our fallen nature.<h2 class=head2>The Trespass Offering</h2><p>In the next case, that of the Samaritan woman in chapter four, we have the trespass offering. Whereas Nicodemus was moral, the Samaritan woman was immoral, even though she was religious. The Samaritan woman had had five husbands, and she was now living with one who was not her husband. Because she was such an immoral person, she needed a trespass offering.<h2 class=head2>The Burnt Offering</h2><p>In chapter seven of the Gospel of John Christ is the burnt offering, the One who was absolute for God. As the absolute One, Christ was for God’s satisfaction, and He sought God’s glory.<h2 class=head2>The Meal Offering</h2><p>In chapter six we can see Christ as the meal offering. The meal offering in the Old Testament was made mainly of fine flour. In John 6 the Lord Jesus says that He is the bread of life, the bread of God, the true and living bread that came down out of heaven (vv. 32-33, 35, 41, 51). Hence, He is the genuine meal offering to feed us.<p>In all these cases we have the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, and the meal offering. If the Lord Jesus were not the offerings, He could not do anything for us, because between us and God there is the great problem of sin. The offerings deal with sin. Sins are the result, the outcome, of sin, and sin is the source of sins. If sin is dealt with, then sins will also be dealt with.
