   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHURCH BEING THE ISSUE OF THE TRIUNE GOD TO BE THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Eventually, the sealing Spirit makes us the issue of the Triune God to be the organic Body of Christ Eph 1:19-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We are the issue of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, which is the "inking" of the Triune God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Father's life and nature, the Son's element, and the Spirit's essence are dispensed into our being to saturate us thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then we become the issue of the dispensing of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are the issue of the essence, the element, and the source.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are the issue of the Triune God, and this issue is the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Father is in the Son, the Son is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the essence of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We, the church as the issue of the Triune God, are the same as He is in the sense that we have His life, His nature, His element, and His essence.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are absolutely the same as He is in this respect, but not in His Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We do not possess any part of the Godhead, but we do possess His life, His nature, His element, and His essence.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are divine in the sense of the divine life, the divine nature, the divine essence, and the divine element, but not in the sense of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all need to understand the church and know the church to such an extent.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This knowing and understanding of the church is what keeps us in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we see this, we will never make any division and nothing will shake us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The church as the organic issue of the organic Triune God is altogether one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the oneness that no one can divide.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church is of God's economy and is of God's good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, the church is constituted of God the Father's nature and life, God the Son's element, and God the Spirit's essence through the sealing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church is the issue of the Triune God to be the organic Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE CHURCH BEING THE CHURCH OF GOD, THE CHURCH OF CHRIST, AND THE CHURCH OF THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The organically divine church is the church of God 1 Cor 10:32 , the church of Christ Rom 16:16b , and the church of the saints 1 Cor 14:33b .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this church there is God, so the church belongs to God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this church there is Christ, so the church belongs to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this church there are many saints, so the church belongs to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE CHURCH BEING UNIVERSAL AS THE UNIQUE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church is universal as the unique Body of Christ Eph 1:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Body is not an organization but an organism constituted with all the regenerated believers for the expression and activities of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE CHURCH BEING ALSO LOCAL AS THE CHURCHES IN DIFFERENT LOCALITIES FOR THE UNIVERSAL EXPRESSION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The church is also local as the churches in different localities for the universal expression of Christ Acts 8:1; 13:1; 1 Cor 1:2; Rev 1:4, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The church is universal and also local.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The local churches in different localities are not merely for a local expression, but for the universal expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All the churches express the same person Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The local churches should express Christ universally, not just locally.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the church in a locality expresses only their locality, that is terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That makes them a local sect, a local division.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They are a local church, but they do not express a "local" Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ is not a local Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God, Christ, the Spirit, and the Bible are not local.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some make the Bible local, they make God local, they make Christ local, and they make the Spirit local.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They make everything local.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In this case they have become local divisions, local sects.</S>
