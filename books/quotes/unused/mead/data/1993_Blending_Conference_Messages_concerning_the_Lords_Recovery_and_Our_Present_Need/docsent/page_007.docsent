   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Eternal Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In general, among Christians the eternal life, which is called "everlasting life," has been understood not as a kind of life but as a kind of blissful environment for the believers of Christ to enjoy for eternity in heaven after they die.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Even today the teaching in Christianity concerning the matter of "going to heaven" is very strong.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christian teachers do not teach people the proper understanding of the eternal life, but they interpret the eternal life to be a kind of blissful environment in which the believers will enjoy certain good things for eternity in heaven after they die.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They say that this is everlasting life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What a blunder this is!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But thank the Lord that in the last seventy years He has recovered among us the scriptural view and the proper realization of the eternal life of God, which we have received of God through our believing in the Son of God, Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is a life on the highest plane, being the divine life of God and even the complete Triune God Himself, uncreated, incorruptible, indestructible, and also eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To be eternal means to be perfect and complete in quality, quantity, time, space, and existence.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The eternal life that we received through our believing in Christ is perfect and complete in its quality, in its quantity, in time, in space, and in its existence.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is eternally perfect and complete.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It exists eternally in time and in space.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not transient but everlasting in all aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is with this eternal and everlasting, perfect and complete, incorruptible and indestructible, wonderful and marvelous life that we have been regenerated, that we are being transformed, and that we will be glorified with the consummated Triune God Himself as our eternal glory.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is eternal life!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>D. The Church</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to the revelation and pattern of the New Testament, the church is the gathering of the believers in Christ who have been called out from the world by God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Such a gathering is considered, on the one hand, the house of the living God 1 Tim 3:15 for Him to dwell in and to carry out His will according to His desire and for His pleasure, and, on the other hand, the organic Body of Christ Eph 1:22-23 for Him to have a counterpart in the organic union with Him for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This church is the new man as God's new creation Col 3:10; Gal 6:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Such a church, as both the house of God and the Body of Christ, is universally one to appear and be expressed on the earth in many localities as many local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The fellowship in life of this church is uniquely one, both universally and locally.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Such a church remained in such a genuine condition only for a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Near the end of the first century, at the time of the early apostles, divisions, sects, crept in to damage the genuine church and created the degradation of the church 1 Cor 1:10-13; Rom 16:17; Titus 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Such divisions grew worse and worse in the succeeding centuries, including the time of the church fathers, and the church attempted to solve the problem of divisions by holding councils with the leading teachers in the leading cities, such as Nicaea, Ephesus, etc. This did not work out as well as expected.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Such a confused situation remained until the end of the sixth century, when the papal system was established to deform the church by forming the universal Catholic Church under the pope to keep a false unity throughout the world.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the Reformation that took place in the sixteenth century, through Martin Luther's teaching, many gave up the Catholic Church under the pope, but they did not receive the proper revelation and the enlightening help to recover the genuine practice of the church according to the New Testament revelation and pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They were sidetracked first to form the state churches, such as the state church of Germany and the Church of England, and then to invent the private churches, the private denominations, such as the Baptist church and the Presbyterian church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the meantime, in the eighteenth century Zinzendorf recovered the practice of the church to some extent, but not in full.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then, in the nineteenth century the British brothers recovered the practice of the church very much, even to the extent of having the local assemblies as the church in Philadelphia Rev 3:7-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, regrettably, that glorious situation did not remain very long.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The British brothers were divided, even in their first generation, into the so-called closed brethren and open brethren, with an addition, the Newton brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Up to the beginning of the twentieth century, after they had existed for only a little over half a century, they were divided into hundreds of divisive assemblies, even having several assemblies in the same city.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Under that kind of situation the Lord was forced to raise up a recovery as a new beginning in the pagan and conservative China as the virgin soil for the church practice from the third decade of this century.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this fresh action the Lord has recovered among us in the last seven decades the proper understanding and definition of the eternal life, the genuine understanding of the church of God, the boundary of the local church, the genuine ground of the church, Christ as the overcoming life, Christ as the all-inclusive One who has the preeminence in all things both in God's old creation and in His new creation and who is the centrality and universality of God's eternal economy, the church as the Body of Christ, the all-inclusive, compounded, and life-giving Spirit, God's eternal economy concerning Christ and the church, the Triune God's dispensing Himself into the tripartite man, the ultimate issue of God's chosen people as the New Jerusalem, the full view and the full definition of the New Jerusalem as God's ultimate manifestation and expression in His mingling with all His redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified elect for eternity, etc. In such a recovery we practice the genuine church, caring for the all-inclusive Christ, the consummated Spirit, the eternal life, and all the divine truths of reality, not of vain letters, and endeavoring to escape from organization, dogmatic regulations, rituals, the clerical system, and traditions, that we may practice the universal priesthood, the universal function of all the members of Christ in the church life for the building up of the Body of Christ in God's eternal economy.</S>
