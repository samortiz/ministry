   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Spirit Being the Transmission of God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God the Father is embodied in God the Son, and God the Son is realized, transmitted, experienced and gained by us in God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit as the third in the Godhead is God being our realization and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that the application of the Triune God to us comes by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For this reason, in our experience the Triune God is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Electrical current is an illustration of the Spirit as the application of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Apart from the current of electricity, electricity cannot be applied.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In its application, electricity needs to become an electrical current.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The current, however, is not something different from electricity itself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The current of electricity is simply electricity in motion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the same principle, the application of the Triune God to us is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Spirit is the current of the Triune God for us to apply; He is the Triune God in motion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE SPIRIT BEING THE ENTIRE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, it is very important to see that the Father and the Son are fully realized in the Spirit as the third of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that we cannot separate the Holy Spirit from the Son or the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The three of the Godhead not only coexist, but They also coinhere.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, among the Father, Son, and Spirit there are both coexistence and coinherence.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God is triune; He is three-one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have covered these matters quite thoroughly in the Triune God lesson book.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Holy Spirit is the ultimate and consummate reaching of the Triune God to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not think that when the Holy Spirit reaches you, only He, the third of the Godhead, comes, and that the Father and the Son remain in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some Christians have such an understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Instead of believing that Christ is in us, they claim that Christ sent the Holy Spirit to function as His representative in us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This concept is altogether wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Bible does not speak of the Spirit representing the Son in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the contrary, according to the Scriptures, when the Holy Spirit comes, the Son comes with Him and in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Father also comes with the Son and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that when the Holy Spirit comes to us, the entire Triune God comes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to the Bible, we may say that the Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How marvelous that the Holy Spirit is the consummate reaching of the Triune God to you and me!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>V. THE SPIRIT OF REALITY</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because the Spirit is the realization of the Triune God, He is called the Spirit of reality John 14:17; 15:26; 16:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In John 16:13 we see that the Spirit of reality guides us into all the reality: "But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but whatever he hears He will speak; and he will disclose to you what is to come."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Spirit of reality guides the believers into all the reality of the Triune God and of all divine matters.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Spirit of reality guides us into the reality of justification, holiness, love, and all other divine things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He leads us into, brings us into, the reality of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we would apply all that God and Christ are, we need the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must praise the Lord that today He is not only the Father and the Son but also the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is not only the source and the course but also the application.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Spirit reaches us, entering into us and applying all that we need of the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is wonderful.</S>
