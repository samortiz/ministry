   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Hebrews 10:34 speaks of a group of believers whose possessions had been plundered.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Yet they "accepted it with joy."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Not only did they accept it willingly, but they accepted it with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the result of the work of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The saints' attitude toward their possessions indicates whether their soul-life is living or being put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we truly desire to have the soul separated from the spirit, we must allow God to work on us concerning these things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then our heart will be truly severed from everything of the world, and we will no longer have a heart like Lot's wife.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This indifference to the riches of the world is one condition for us to attain to the perfect spiritual life in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is only when the Holy Spirit reveals to the saints the reality of heaven and the fullness of the spiritual life that they can despise the things of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The reason for this is that there is no comparison between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the experience of the apostle in Philippians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the beginning he counted "all things to be loss."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the end he "suffered the loss of all things" v. 8 that he might gain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The end result of this was Paul's knowing the power of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the perfect life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many times we do not realize how strong our soul-life is.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is only manifested when we are tried in material things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many times it seems to require less grace to lose one's life than to lose one's riches!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The things of the world are indeed the acid test for the existence or death of the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If God's children are too concerned about their food, drink, and dwelling, they need to receive the deeper work of the cross so that their spirit will not be surrounded and affected by their soul.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this way they will be delivered from everything worldly, and their spirit will be able to live before God unhindered.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If a person is concerned for the things of the world, it means that his soul-life has not been lost, and he has not yet passed through the work of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In John 12:24 and 25 the Lord Jesus again mentions the question of the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He who loves his soul-life loses it; and he who hates his soul-life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Later the Lord Jesus expounds the meaning of these two verses: "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to Myself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But He said this signifying by what kind of death He was about to die" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>32-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This chapter records the greatest moment of the Lord's life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Lazarus had been resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many Jews had believed because of Lazarus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even some Greeks were coming to see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It was also at this time that He entered into Jerusalem and was welcomed by the people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, in man's view, at this time there seemed to be no need of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It seemed as if the Lord Jesus could draw all men to Himself without going to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But He knew that there was no other way to save men except by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although His work was prosperous outwardly, He knew that unless He died, He could not give His life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If He died, He would draw all men to Himself and would dispense life to all men.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here the Lord presents clearly the lesson of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He likens Himself to a grain of wheat; unless it dies in the ground, it remains one grain.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if He were indeed crucified on the cross, He would give life to many.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Here the Lord Jesus presents the qualification for all fruit bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Unless one dies, he will not bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Other than death, there is no other way to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But our purpose is not just to study what the Lord Jesus is in Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What we are emphasizing is the relationship this has with our soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The grain of wheat in verse 24 refers to the Lord Jesus Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But in verse 25 He points out that the kind of death He was to suffer and the result it was to produce would not be limited to Himself alone.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All His disciples had to follow in His footsteps.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He then tells us what the meaning of the grain of wheat is to a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He points out that this grain is a symbol of our soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As a grain of wheat will not live unless it dies, in the same way one will not bear fruit unless the soul-life dies.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What the Lord emphasizes here is the matter of fruit bearing in our work.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although a believer may be quite powerful in his soul-life, this power will not help him to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All the talents, gifts, knowledge, wisdom, and power that issue from the soul-life will not help a believer produce many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As the Lord Jesus had to die to bear fruit, in the same way a believer must die before he will bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To the Lord Jesus, although the soul-life is powerful, this power is useless in helping God bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Here we see that the Lord Jesus was making a clear comparison between the soul-life and the eternal life, the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He shows us that the soul-life loves itself.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This means that the soul-life is self-centered.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hence, He charges the saints to take the attitude of "hating" their own soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This hating'' is realized in the putting to death of our soul-life on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There is a reason for us to handle the soul-life in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we do not, we will suffer loss, an eternal loss.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If the soul-life reigns within us, it will forever control the spirit, and the spirit will not be able to express the pure and divine life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This mixture of the soul and the spirit will deprive us of our fruit bearing, which can only come from one who is spiritually pure.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Self-love is the greatest characteristic of the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we do not put our self-love to death through the cross of the Lord, our spiritual life will be affected by it daily and will manifest impurities.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We have seen how the Lord has called us to the cross to put our soul-life to death.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Unless we place ourselves on the altar in this way, our High Priest will have no way to apply His sharp knife to divide our spirit from our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We must allow the cross to work before we can receive the work of our High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We should follow the example of our Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When He died, He "poured out His soul unto death" Isa 53:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>At the same time, He committed His spirit to God Luke 23:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>What He did is what we must do.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The soul-life must die.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we truly pour out our soul-life unto death and commit our spirit to God, we will soon experience being resurrected by God and have the fullness of the spiritual life in the glory of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we truly put our soul-life to death through the cross, our High Priest will divide our soul from our spirit with the word of God.</S>
