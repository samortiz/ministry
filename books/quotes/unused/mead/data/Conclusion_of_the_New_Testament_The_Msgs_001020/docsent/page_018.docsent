   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE FIVE GOD HIS PERSON 3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider further aspects of God's person revealed in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>9.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Head of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First Corinthians 11:3 says, "I want you to know that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ is God's anointed One, appointed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, He is under God, and God as the Originator is His Head.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This refers to the relationship between Christ and God in the divine government.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the universe, especially in God's governmental administration, there is order.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God is the Head over Christ, Christ is the Head over every man, and man is the head over the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>10.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Savior of All</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 1 Timothy 1:1 Paul says, "Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, according to the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God our Savior 1 Tim 4:10; Titus 2:13 and our Savior God 1 Tim 2:3; Titus 1:3; 2:10; 3:4 are titles particularly ascribed to God in the three books of 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, books that take God's salvation as a strong base for the teachings concerning God's New Testament economy 1 Tim 1:15-16; 2:4-6; 2 Tim 1:9-10; 2:10; 3:15; Titus 2:14; 3:5-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It was according to the command of such a saving God, a Savior God, not according to the command of the law-giving God, a demanding God, that Paul became an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First Timothy 2:3 says, "This is good and acceptable in the sight of our Savior God."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 1 Timothy Paul emphasizes the Savior God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, in this verse he speaks not of the God of grace nor of the God of mercy, but of the Savior God, the God who saves us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1 Timothy 4:10 Paul goes on to speak of "the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Titus 1:3 Paul again speaks of "the command of our Savior God."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then in Titus 2:10 he speaks concerning "the teachings of our Savior God."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our Savior is not only Christ, but God Triune embodied in Christ, as indicated in Titus 2:13.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our Savior God desires not only to save us, but also to teach us the full knowledge of the truth 1 Tim 2:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, there is the teaching of our Savior God, which may be adorned, beautified, by the transformed character of the most vile persons saved by His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Titus 3:4 Paul tells us that "the kindness and love to man of our Savior God appeared."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is the kindness and love of our Savior God that has saved us and made us different from others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Jude 25 also speaks of God our Savior: "To the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, might, and authority before all time, and now, and unto all eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here we see that the only God is our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To such a Savior may there be glory, majesty, might, and authority throughout all ages.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Glory is the expression and splendor; majesty, the greatness in honor; might, the strength in power; and authority, the power in ruling.</S>
