   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NO LONGER IMPOTENT IN HIM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Romans 8:1: "There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is no condemnation for those in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"Condemnation" does not refer to any ordinary kind of condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to some recently discovered old manuscripts of the Bible found in Egypt, this word has two meanings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first is a legal term; the second is a common daily expression.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the legal context it means condemnation as a verdict.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But in its ordinary usage it means impotent, powerless, bound, etc. For this reason I will translate this portion as, "There is now then no impotence..." There is no more weakness and inability.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 2: "For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here are two laws.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Originally, we were all bound by the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now the law of the Spirit of life has freed us; we are no longer under the control of the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The law of the Spirit of life is in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Have you seen this?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once again, our relationship with Him sets us free.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 10: "But if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the spirit is life because of righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since Christ is in me, I can live.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>MORE THAN CONQUERORS IN HIM</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Romans 8:35, 37: "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Shall tribulation or anguish or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword?...But in all these things we more than conquer through Him who loved us."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although there is so much trouble outwardly, we are still more than conquerors.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Strength is obtained by going through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Not that we are able in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is all by Him and through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the same manner, verses 38 and 39 say, "For I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor things present nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor any other creature will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Why can nothing separate us from His love?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is not because of our virtues, but because this love is "in Christ Jesus our Lord"!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Love is tied to the person Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we are in Christ, we are in this inseparable love.</S>
