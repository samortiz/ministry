AND RUSSIA IN THE FIRST STEP</h2>
<p>Initially, I considered that we should go to Europe in the first step to Great Britain, France, Germany, and Russia. But after receiving reports from the brothers who traveled to Europe, I realized that our main goal should be eastern Germany and western Russia. Although we will mainly concentrate on eastern Germany and western Russia, this does not mean that no one should go to Great Britain, France, or western Germany. Furthermore, we should realize that Great Britain is very crucial for the Lord&rsquo;s move throughout Europe.</p>
<p>Today all of Russia is open to our publications. We should not lose the opportunity to fill Russia with our writings. We are looking to the Lord for the publishing of one million copies, as proposed by some Russian brothers to us, of each of the six books we mentioned in chapter one&mdash;<em>The Normal Christian Life, The Spiritual Man, The Experience of Life, The Knowledge of Life, The Economy of God</em>, and <em>God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy.</em> I hope that we would pray for this.</p>
<p>I expected that we would initially have forty saints who would be willing to be trained in the fall for emigrating to Europe, but thus far more than one hundred seventy have signed up for going to Europe. We hope that the saints who are burdened and will be trained in the fall will be able to leave for Europe by January 1992. By that time some of the books in different languages will be prepared. We hope to teach the trainees a foreign language by means of a particular book from the ministry which we will compose in English and translate into that language. In this way they will be able to pick up the spiritual vocabulary, and they can go to Europe to speak to the people with the truths from the book they have studied.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Emigrate to the Leading Cities That Have Colleges or Universities for Us to Work On</h2>
<p>We are burdened to emigrate to the leading cities that have colleges and universities for us to work on. We are doing research so that we can find all the leading universities in Europe for our emigration there.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Go in a Team of<br />
at Least Four Saints, Including a Couple<br />
between the Ages of Thirty and Fifty,<br />
in Whose Home the Meetings Will Begin</h2>
<p>We are burdened to go to Europe in a team of at least four saints, including a couple between the ages of thirty to fifty, in whose home the meetings will begin. Every team of saints going to Europe should have a couple, and this couple may have some children. This family will be the center of the team. We will try to help them to get a home close to a college or a university. Hopefully, this home will be big enough for keeping two or three guests. It could serve as a place for some emigrating saints to stay until they can become properly situated. The newly-contacted people can be brought to this home for fellowship. This will be our way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO LIVE, TO WORK, TO SERVE, AND TO MEET</h2>
<h2 class="head2">To Live a Life in Resurrection under the Cross</h2>
<p>Now we want to see the way to live, to work, to serve, and to meet. First, we need to live a life in resurrection under the cross. To live in resurrection is to live in the Spirit of Christ, who is the reality of the resurrection of Christ, and to live under the cross is to experience the death of Christ in our union with Him in His Spirit for the denying of ourselves and our flesh and for the rejection of the world and its influence.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The World Situation and the Direction of the Lord's Move &nbsp; pg 16</div><br></body></html>
