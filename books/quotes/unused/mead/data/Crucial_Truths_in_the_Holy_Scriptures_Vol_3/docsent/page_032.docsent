   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A few points of explanation will help the brothers and sisters in their reading of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Sections of the Bible</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible is divided into two major sections: the Old Testament and the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Each of these is further divided into several sections.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Old Testament</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Containing Five Books</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some call these five books and Lamentations books of poetry because they are written in poetic form.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Section of Prophecy from Isaiah to Malachi Containing Seventeen Books</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These books collectively are called the Prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The longer books are referred to as the major prophets, and the shorter books are referred to as the minor prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Luke 24:44 the Old Testament is divided into three sections: 1 the Law of Moses, the Pentateuch; 2 the Prophets, including the books of history; and 3 the Psalms, including the books of poetry.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Jews and their rabbis divided the Old Testament according to Luke 24:44: the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The New Testament Containing Three Sections The Section of History from the Gospel of Matthew to the Acts of the Apostles Containing Five Books</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Types in the Bible</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Old Testament God used types as pictures to depict the truths that would be revealed in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is similar to a kindergarten teacher using pictures to teach children.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There are many categories of types, including people, things, events, and ceremonies.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Adam Being an Example of a Person as a Type</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ, as the Head of the new creation, is typified by Adam Rom 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Veil in the Temple Being</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>an Example of a Thing as a Type</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The veil of the temple, which separated the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies so that man could not approach God in the Holy of Holies, is a type of the physical body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After the veil was rent, however, man could come before God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the Lord Jesus body was rent on the cross, a new and living way was opened for sinners to approach God Heb 10:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His death on the cross enables us to come to God directly.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Children of Israel Leaving Egypt</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Being an Example of an Event as a Type</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Before God s salvation was manifested, God typified His salvation through the event of the children of Israel leaving Egypt 1 Cor 10:1-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Passover Being an Example</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>of a Ceremony as a Type</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Passover in the Old Testament is a type, a living picture, of Christ s death.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God used this ceremony to point to the death of Christ in the New Testament 5:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Prophecies in the Bible</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The prophecies in the Bible are fulfilled literally.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The greatest prophecies in the Bible concern the two comings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The prophecies concerning the first coming of Christ have been fulfilled literally.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For example, the prophecy concerning a virgin was actually fulfilled by a virgin Isa 7:14; Matt 1:18-21 ; the prophecy concerning the Lord riding on a foal of a donkey was actually fulfilled with a foal of a donkey Zech 9:9; Matt 21:2-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The prophecies concerning the second coming of Christ and other unfulfilled prophecies will certainly be fulfilled literally.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, our explanation of prophecy must be absolutely literal.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Furthermore, no prophecy of Scripture is of one s own interpretation 2 Pet 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This means that no prophecy can be interpreted in isolation from other Scripture; we must see how it relates to other prophecies on the same subject.</S>
