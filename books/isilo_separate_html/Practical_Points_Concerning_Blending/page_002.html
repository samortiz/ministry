How we thank You that You have brought us all into Your recovery. In the past years we have enjoyed Your rich mercy and Your abounding grace. Lord, we love You and we need You. We need You to the uttermost. This is why we have come here. Thank You for Your gathering. We look unto You for further and further mercy and grace. Be one spirit with us and anoint the entire congregation. Lord, sustain us. Be one with us in Your speaking. Lord, would You speak in our speaking? We trust in You. Thank You, dear Lord.
