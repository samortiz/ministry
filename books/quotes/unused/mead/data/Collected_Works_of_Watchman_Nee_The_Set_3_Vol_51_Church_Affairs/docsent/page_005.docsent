   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Able to Manage His Own Household</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After you have three, five, seven, or eight such people, you still have to examine them in the aspect of managing practical affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The one who can manage and administrate can be an overseer.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If a person cannot manage his own household, he cannot take care of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If the church were like a worldly organization, we would need to select only those who have ability.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the church is a spiritual organization; therefore, you must first take care of the question of spirituality and then look at the ability, at whether or not a particular one can take care of practical affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If he cannot manage practical affairs, neither can he be an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Only one who has knowledge in spiritual things and possesses ability in handling practical affairs will have very little problem in the church, and his condition will be quite reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Otherwise, he will be able to handle practical affairs, but he will cause damage on the spiritual side.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That would not be right.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>An Example</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A brother, who has passed away, was an elder of a Christian group.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>During our early days in Shanghai, he often came to my place to talk.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was a good brother and really capable in handling practical affairs, and he was also zealous.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But he had very little understanding in spiritual things, if any, and he was even more lacking in spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One day he came to talk with me and said, "A sister among us sinned and cried loudly in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Mr. Nee, don't you think that is funny?'' After he finished speaking, he sat there and began to laugh loudly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>An elder in a church considered it a laughable matter to see a sister confess her sins and cry.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You can realize then his spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Of course, he was the best in his group, but he could not bear responsibility in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He himself had never confessed his sins or wept to such an extent, so naturally he considered it funny when he saw someone weeping one day.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I am only citing an example.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There may be several hundred cases like this in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To weep for your sins is an elementary matter in spiritual life, but this brother did not understand this at all.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What shall we do if he also laughs at many other spiritual actions related to us?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such a one feels that all the spiritual things are strange and laughable and cannot comprehend one spiritual thing at all.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If he becomes an elder, the church is finished with regard to its spiritual path.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, as to the requirements for an elder, the first relates to spiritual things, to spiritual understanding, and to spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To be an elder, a person also needs to be reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do not consider someone who behaves like a drunkard, wandering around doing nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sometimes his condition is good and at other times it is bad.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Such a person cannot manage the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The one who manages the church must be quite stable and quite reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At the same time, he should also be able to manage his own household.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Without this, he is not qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, do not reverse the foundation and the building.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not select a person who can handle only practical affairs well.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Such a person can be a deacon at the most, but never an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At the most he can be one who only receives instructions in the church; he cannot give instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Exclusive Responsibility of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Being the Care of Spiritual Matters</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Perhaps I can give another illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Suppose that today you meet a very intelligent and capable person.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If he goes to work in a hospital, at the most you can ask him to handle practical affairs, but you cannot ask him to be the chief physician.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At the most you can ask him to manage business affairs, but not to diagnose diseases.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A hospital is a professional organization, not a business organization.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There may be a person in a business school who is very intelligent and very capable of handling things, but you cannot ask him to be a dean, a principal, or a department chairman immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At the most you can invite him to take care of only general affairs, because the other positions are specialized and can be held only by those who have special knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There may be a very bright person in a business corporation, but you cannot ask him to be the manager of business operations immediately, because business operations are specialized.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Similarly, the church is an organization that specializes in spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, you may ask only those who know the trade to do the job.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You need to know that the church is spiritual and that practical affairs are only secondary.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, when you select an elder in a certain locality, you should first consider him from the spiritual viewpoint.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Afterward, you have to see whether or not he knows how to direct, oversee, and lead.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This brother must be one who has insight and knowledge in spiritual things, who has been built up in them, and who also has the capability in practical affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then, when there are spiritual matters, he will not cause problems.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, I hope the brothers will pay special attention to these things.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Do not lightly select a person to be an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When you make a selection, pay attention to the spiritual aspect first, and then pay attention to the practical aspect.</S>
