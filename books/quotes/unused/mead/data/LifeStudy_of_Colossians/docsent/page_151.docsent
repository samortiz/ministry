   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE FIFTY CHRIST REPLACED IN EVERY WAY Scripture Reading: Col 2:2b-4, 6-8; 1:27; 3:3-4; 2:6-7a; 1 Cor 1:5, 7a, 9, 22-24; 2:2; Gal 1:14-16a; 2:20a; 4:19; 5:2, 4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the book of Colossians Paul sets forth not only the revelation of the all-inclusive Christ, but also the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we consider this book, we need to see both the revelation and the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we shall see that in the experience of Christians, Christ has been replaced in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE REVELATION OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The revelation concerning Christ in Colossians is both all-inclusive and extensive.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Colossians reveals that Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ is the Firstborn both of the old creation, the universe, and of the new creation, the church 1:15, 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The new creation is not as extensive as the old creation, the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The church is all-inclusive, but it is not extensive.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For Christ to be the Firstborn of both the original creation and the new creation means that He is both extensive and all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the new man there is room only for Christ; Christ is all and in all 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This shows His all-inclusiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, the fact that He is the Firstborn of all creation indicates His extensiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the words of Ephesians 3, Christ is the breadth, length, height, and depth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The revelation of the all-inclusive and extensive Christ is found adequately, fully, definitely, and clearly in the Epistles of Paul, in particular in the book of Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 1:25 Paul says that he became a minister according to the stewardship of God to complete the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Colossians was written to complete the word of God, to complete the divine revelation in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Without Colossians, the divine revelation in the Scriptures would not be complete.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The completion of the Word of God found in Colossians is the mystery of God s economy Christ in us, the hope of glory 1:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that without Christ in us as the hope of glory, God s revelation would have no completion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We thank the Lord that His revelation is completed, recorded, and presented to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>DISTRACTED FROM CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For centuries, Christians have had this revelation in their hands.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, it has been neglected.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although Christ has been revealed adequately, definitely, emphatically, and fully, in the experience of Christians He has been replaced by many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although there are millions of Christians in this country, not many have paid adequate attention to Christ in us, the hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This has been true even among us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In particular, culture has replaced Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 1961 I wrote the hymn, Not the law of letters, but the Christ of life Hymns , #541 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But in this hymn I did not say anything about culture.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When I wrote it, I did not see that culture was the strongest and most subtle replacement of Christ in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Nevertheless, more than forty-five years ago, I saw that God does not want anything other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although this vision is very clear, I must confess that I still do not live Christ adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From time to time, I have been distracted from Christ to other things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Have you ever asked yourself how much you live Christ day by day?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For the most part, we live Christ only when we are praying in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By this we see how little we actually live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In our daily living Christ is replaced by other things.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In particular, things that are good in our eyes become replacements for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For example, Christ may be replaced by your humility.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Spontaneously and unconsciously, you live your natural humility instead of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Inwardly, a naturally humble person may be proud of his humility, especially when he compares himself with others.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But this humility of which he boasts is a replacement of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Actually, such humility is not a virtue in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because it replaces Christ, it is something very unpleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Day by day, Christ is replaced by many things.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He may be replaced by our diligence, frankness, and honesty.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Instead of living Christ, we may live these natural attributes or characteristics.</S>
