   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>APPLYING THE DEATH OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When I was a young Christian, I found out that I had been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to some books I read, when Christ was crucified, I was included in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This puzzled me.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He had died hundreds of years before and far away.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How could I have died when He died?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was beyond my comprehension, but gradually I concluded that I should accept it by faith, in spite of its sounding so illogical.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Other books later came to my attention.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The thought in them was that the death of Christ is credited by God to my account.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>My part was to reckon myself dead, based upon that deposit in my account.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For quite some time I practiced this advice, but frankly the more I reckoned myself dead, the more alive I seemed to be!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No doubt many of you have had this same experience.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For years I was bothered by this failure to make the death of Christ apply to my everyday living.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One day, however, the Lord opened the divine Word to show me that the death of Christ is included in His wonderful Person.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you reach for the God of eternity past, all you will find is divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today, however, when you come to God, He reaches you full of rich ingredients.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can liken Him to a flavorful drink.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In eternity past He was only plain water.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now tea has been added.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then milk.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then sugar.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Perhaps some other flavors.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God is now a rich, delicious beverage, no longer just plain water!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Have you ever before realized how rich is the God in whom we believe?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Since the day the Lord opened my eyes to see this, I have been released from my efforts to believe and to reckon.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have this living One within me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is called the almighty God, the Lord Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of life, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These are all different titles for the same wonderful Person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In my early Christian life, my understanding of the Bible was according to what is generally believed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Only later did I begin to see how much more there is to the Bible than what is conventionally taught.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I began to realize how great is this wonderful Person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As the years have gone by, He has shown me more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I long to convey to you how precious this One in resurrection is.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When you call on His name, He will reach you not merely as God, but with all that has been added to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do not think of God as one Person and the Holy Spirit as another.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is only one God, even though He is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The divine Spirit today includes divinity, humanity, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the God in whom you are abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit," 1 John 4:13 declares.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE SPIRIT MOVING</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This Spirit He has given us, which is simply Himself, is not dormant within.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is living, active, moving.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, the writer of this Epistle uses the term anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"Ye have an anointing Gk. from the Holy One, and ye know all things .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him" 1 John 2:20, 27 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Electricity moving and harnessed for our use is called the current of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The current is not other than the electricity; it is simply electricity in motion.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God moving within us is called the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because God today is the all-inclusive Spirit, He is symbolized not by oil but by an ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Ointment is a compound of various ingredients.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God as the Spirit has been compounded with all these elements through which He has passed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This Spirit is gently and constantly moving within us as the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>THE OLD TESTAMENT TYPE</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This compound ointment is pictured for us in Exodus 30:23-25.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The anointing ointment was made of four spices added to a hin of olive oil.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Every one of the spices has a spiritual significance.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Myrrh typifies the Lord's sweet death.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Whenever we consider that death, we find we have a sweet sensation within.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Myrrh was one of the spices used in preparing Him for burial John 19:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Cinnamon, another of the spices of the anointing ointment, signifies the effectiveness of the Lord's death.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Cinnamon has certain healing properties.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The third spice was calamus, a reed which grows out of muddy places high into the air.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It speaks of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord's resurrection was like a reed shooting out of the muddy situation into the clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Cassia, the last spice, repels insects and especially snakes.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It reminds us of the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The anointing ointment, then, includes the death of Christ, the effectiveness of His death, the resurrection, and the power of resurrection.</S>
