<p>Basically speaking, we should not meet in big meetings, but with a small number. The smallest number for gathering is two. The Lord refers to two or three meeting together into His name. Without two, you cannot have any gathering. To build up the local church you need to go to the bottom of the required number for meetings. Do not require twenty or two hundred for a meeting. Just require two. Let the saints meet with two or three, with a small number. By the Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 18:20 we can realize that in the Lord&rsquo;s intention He did not want to have big gatherings in the local church for practical help. Big gatherings can only be good for general teaching and could never be good to give some practical help. You cannot practically help any brother merely by attending a big meeting with him. It is nearly impossible to render any practical help in a big meeting. You must have a little gathering of two or three to render such help. Sometimes if the number of saints meeting is over ten it would still be hard for you to render the practical help. We need the small number for our meetings so that we can take care of everyone&rsquo;s need practically. I hope that we could all be impressed with this point in the Word of the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GATHERED INTO THE NAME</h2>
<p>In Matthew 18:20 the Lord did not say where two or three meet together but where two or three are gathered together. The verb is not in the active voice but in the passive voice. The two or three are gathered. By whom are they gathered? Surely they are not gathered by the elders. They are gathered by the Lord. If we say the two or three meet together, this meeting is initiated by the ones who meet. For two or three to be gathered together, however, indicates that someone is doing the gathering. These two or three are gathered by the unseen Lord because they love the Lord and they are concerned for the Lord&rsquo;s members.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they are gathered together not <em>in</em> the name, but <em>into</em> the name. In order for someone to come into something he must come out of something. To get into something you have to leave something. To be gathered into the name of the Lord means to get yourself out of anything that is besides the Lord Himself. Especially, you need to get out of your self. Too many times when we come together, we come together remaining in our self. If we are gathered by the Lord into His name, we have to get out of ourselves. If you remain in the self, you could never be gathered into the name of the Lord. Into the name of the Lord means into the Lord Himself. The name denotes the Person. Matthew 18:20 does not mean that we are gathered in the name of the Lord but that we are gathered out of self into Him. Therefore, He is in our midst. Suppose we are gathered, not out of ourselves, but still remaining in ourselves. Do you believe that in that condition the Lord is with us? It is when we are gathered out of ourselves and out of all things other than the Lord and into Him that He is among us.</p>
<p>In a locality for the building up of a local church we should meet by small numbers and we should meet by being gathered. We do not initiate the gathering, but He does. We should also meet in a way to be gathered out of our self, out of our home, out of the world, out of our family, out of our business, out of our care for money, and out of so many things. Too many times we meet and still remain in so many things other than Christ. We have to be gathered out of so many things into His name, His Person. It seems as if the Lord was saying, &ldquo;Do not remain in anything other than Me when you are gathered together.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">DESTROYING HIERARCHY<br />
THROUGH THE HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>By putting Matthew 18:20, Acts 2:46; 5:42, 1 Corinthians 14:23 and 26, and Hebrews 10:25 together, we can see that the main point in these verses is mutuality in speaking. If you have seen this, you can realize how off today&rsquo;s Christians are in the matter of meeting. The reason for the deviation in the way that today&rsquo;s Christians meet is mainly due to hierarchy. Without the building up of hierarchy, there is no need of having big gatherings all the time. We ourselves must admit that we are still under the influence not only of tradition, but also of hierarchy. For a local church to practice having big meetings all the time is the practice of hierarchy. You may say that among us there is no clergy and laity. Actually, however, as long as all the meetings in your locality are big meetings, laity is there and a very secret, hidden clergy is being built up. The only thing that can kill and tear down the clergy-laity system and destroy the foundation of hierarchy is to have the small meetings.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> </body></html>
