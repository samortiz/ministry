   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SPREADING THE MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THROUGH THE TWELVE APOSTLES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 9:1-6 we have the spreading of the ministry through the twelve apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This spreading of the ministry is actually the spreading of the jubilee.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Giving Them Power and Authority</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>over Demons and to Heal Diseases</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Luke 9:1 says, And having called together the twelve, He gave them power and authority over all the demons, and to heal diseases.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The power and authority over demons and to heal diseases is for the release of the captives.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As a result of the fall, man was captured by Satan, sin, and disease, which is the issue of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every fallen human being is a captive both of demons and of diseases.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, the Man-Savior gave the twelve power and authority over demons and diseases.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the negative aspect of the jubilee, the aspect of the release of the captives.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The authority in 9:1 over demons and disease is a foretaste of the power of the coming age Heb 6:5 , that is, of the millennium, in which all demons will be cast out and all diseases will be healed Isa 35:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Demons are the spirits of the living creatures who lived in the preadamic age and were judged by God when they joined Satan s rebellion see Life-study of Genesis Message 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The fallen angels work with Satan in the air Eph 2:2; 6:11-12 , and the demons move with him on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Both act evilly upon man for the kingdom of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The possession of people by demons signifies Satan s usurpation of man, whom God created for His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The demons need to be cast out from possessed people so that they may be delivered from Satan s bondage Luke 13:16 , out of Satan s authority of darkness Acts 26:18; Col 1:13 , into God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sending Them to Proclaim the Kingdom of God</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Luke 9:2 says, And He sent them to proclaim the kingdom of God and to cure the sick.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here we have the proclaiming of the kingdom of God as the positive aspect of the jubilee.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The kingdom of God involves the recovery of the right to enjoy God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Let us review what we have said in an earlier message concerning the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The kingdom of God is the Savior 17:21 as the seed of life, sown into His believers, God s chosen people Mark 4:3, 26 , and developing into a realm which God may rule as His kingdom in His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Its entrance is regeneration John 3:5 , and its development is the believers growth in the divine life 2 Pet 1:3-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is the church life today, in which the faithful believers live Rom 14:17 , and it will develop into the coming kingdom as an inheritance reward Gal 5:21; Eph 5:5 to the overcoming saints in the millennium Rev 20:4, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Eventually, it will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the eternal kingdom of God, an eternal realm of the eternal blessing of God s eternal life for all God s redeemed to enjoy in the new heaven and new earth for eternity Rev 21:1-4; 22:1-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Such a kingdom, the kingdom of God, is what the Savior preached as the gospel, the good news 4:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to 9:2, the Lord sent out the twelve to proclaim the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To proclaim the kingdom of God is to proclaim the jubilee.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In particular, it is to proclaim the positive aspect of the jubilee the recovery of our lost right to the enjoyment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, in sending out the twelve, the Man-Savior was spreading the jubilee through them to the surrounding country.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Charging the Twelve to Take Nothing</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>for Their Journey</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 9:3 and 4 the Lord said to the twelve, Take nothing for the journey, neither a staff, nor a bag, nor bread, nor money, nor have two tunics apiece.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>And into whatever house you enter, remain there, and from there go out.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Why did the Man-Savior tell the sent ones not to take anything for their journey?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The reason He told them to take nothing was that in the jubilee things are common under God s ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, there was no need for the twelve to take anything for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The picture here indicates that when the jubilee comes there will not be any selfishness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Instead, everything will be both for us and for others.</S>
