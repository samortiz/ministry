   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE EGYPTIAN DIET A. Making People Egyptian</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Egyptian diet causes people to become Egyptian.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For example, if people are consumed with watching television, they become television.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Likewise, if they are given to a certain sport or amusement, they become constituted with that sport or amusement.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These illustrations indicate that the Egyptian diet constitutes people with the Egyptian element and makes them Egyptian in composition.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>B. Fitting the Lust of the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, the Egyptian diet fits the lust of the flesh 16:3; Num 11:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Anything worldly just fits the taste of our lustful flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>C. Provoking God s Holy Anger</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The people s desire for the Egyptian diet provoked God s holy anger Num 11:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was in His anger and displeasure that He sent them quails.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>D. Causing Death</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Finally, the Egyptian diet issues in death Num 11:33-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The result of the Egyptian diet is always spiritual death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because so many Christians still desire the things of Egypt, they suffer spiritual death, having been smitten by God s holy anger.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE HEAVENLY DIET A. Making People Heavenly</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The heavenly diet makes people heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This heavenly diet is actually Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is the food, the manna.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, by eating Christ we become Christ; that is, Christ becomes our very constituent.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>B. Fulfilling God s Purpose</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The heavenly diet fulfills God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those who built the tabernacle were not Egyptians.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They were those with a heavenly constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It was at least four months after the children of Israel left Egypt that they began to build the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>During these months, their diet had been changed and their constitution was at least in the process of changing and of being replaced with the element of manna.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By feeding on manna, God s people eventually became manna.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As those constituted of manna, they could build the tabernacle as God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This picture shows that only those who have been reconstituted with Christ are qualified to build up the church as God s dwelling place today.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is what it means to say that the heavenly diet fulfills God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The garlic, leeks, onions, melons, and cucumbers were only good to make God s people Egyptian in their constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such things could satisfy their lusts, but they could not enable the people to fulfill God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In order for God s purpose to be accomplished, His people had to be reconstituted with manna.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This reveals that our constitution must be rearranged through the eating of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ must replace the Egyptian diet.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For the building of the church, we all need to be reconstituted with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Remember that those who built the tabernacle had experienced a change of diet and had begun to be reconstituted with the element of manna.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only such people can build God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In fact, after being reconstituted, they themselves are the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>C. Testing the People in Relation to God s Will</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The heavenly diet also tests us in relation to God s will and proves where we are 16:4-5, 16-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Are we one with God and identical to Him?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Where we are will be proved by the detailed regulations concerning the gathering of manna.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These regulations prove whether or not we correspond to God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>D. Keeping the People Alive</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>to Fulfill God s Purpose</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The heavenly diet also keeps God s people alive to fulfill His purpose 16:35; John 6:57 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By means of the heavenly diet we are kept alive for the sake of God s dwelling place, not for any other purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is crucial that we all recognize the need for a change of diet.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to ask ourselves what we hunger and thirst for and what kind of appetite we have.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our diet must change from an Egyptian diet to a heavenly diet.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must turn from the fleshpots, the fish, the cucumbers, the melons, the onions, the garlic, and the leeks to Christ, the unique heavenly food supplied by God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For Christ to be our diet means that He is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He is even our television, entertainment, music, newspapers, and sports.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We all should be able to testify that the Lord has changed our diet from so many items to just one, the heavenly manna.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In a forthcoming message we shall see the riches of manna in all its aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>May the Lord change our diet so that we may be reconstituted with Christ and become God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Along with the change of diet, we need a change of appetite.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I wonder if the children of Israel truly experienced a change of appetite.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They might have eaten manna simply because they were forced to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They had nothing else to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord Jesus said, Do not work for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides to eternal life John 6:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Today all the people in the world are working for the food which perishes.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This perishing food includes things such as television, sports, music, and entertainments.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>All satisfaction of this kind will perish.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Christ Himself is the only food which does not perish.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This food abides to eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>By food we mean anything we take into us for our satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we understand this principle, we shall realize that today s worldly food consists not only of physical food, but also of all other things people live on, including education, money, position, promotion, sports, and entertainment.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The worldly people have physical food and psychological food, but they do not have spiritual food.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Instead of working for the food which abides to eternal life, they labor for the food which perishes.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Lord Jesus is the real manna.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In John 6 He indicates that we should seek Him and eat Him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>However, not many Christians realize the need for a change of diet.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>All those who have been regenerated need to change their diet.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is the reason that Exodus 16 is even more crucial than Exodus 12.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In chapter twelve we see a people who have been redeemed, but we do not see a people who have been reconstituted.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>At the time of chapter fourteen, God s people had come out of Egypt, but Egypt had not come out of them.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>According to their constitution, they were still Egyptians.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Thus, God s intention was to change their constitution by changing their diet.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>By the time the children of Israel had built the tabernacle, their diet had been changed.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Their constitution had probably begun to change also.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When they were building the tabernacle, they did not eat Egyptian food.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Instead, their diet consisted of manna.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Furthermore, after the tabernacle was set up, they spent much time in taking care of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>They had to take it down, carry it, and set it up again.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>During their years in the wilderness, the children of Israel did nothing except eat manna and care for the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>They did not engage in any other industry or endeavor.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This shows that God did not ask them to do anything, not even to engage in farming.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>God fed them by sending manna from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The people simply gathered it, prepared it, ate it, and took care of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>What a marvelous picture this is!</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>As we consider this picture, we see that God only wants us to eat Christ and to take care of the church, His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We should not allow ourselves to lose interest in these things.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Day by day, we should simply eat Christ and practice the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We are here for Christ and the church, not for anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>In the opinion of the outsiders, we in the Lord s recovery spend our time doing nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Some even condemn us because apparently we do not carry on any work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>However, just as the children of Israel daily gathered manna and cared for God s dwelling place, we are daily eating Christ and caring for the proper church life.</S>
