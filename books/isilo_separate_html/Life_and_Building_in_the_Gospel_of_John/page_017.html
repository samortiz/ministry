<p>The name of the Lord Jesus is powerful. When our heart is full of sorrow and there is no one to whom we can talk, we simply need to call on the Lord in order for our sorrows to be lifted and our burdens to be unloaded. This is a wonderful matter. We simply need to call upon the name of the Lord Jesus, and we will touch something within; that is, we will touch God, the Word, life, and light. God, the Word, life, and light are in the Spirit because the Lord is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). Although it may be difficult to understand the Spirit, receiving the Spirit is very practical. Even though we may not understand electricity, we can live by it every day. God is Spirit, the Word is Spirit, life is Spirit, and light is Spirit. If we want to receive Him, we only need to fulfill the requirement of believing into His name. To believe into His name is to receive Him. We can call upon His name, saying, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, You are so lovely! Lord Jesus, You are so dignified! O Lord, You are so great! You are full of love!&rdquo; Even new believers can speak simple words, saying, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, You are so good to me! Lord Jesus, Your heart is so tender, loving, and forbearing.&rdquo; We only need to call on Him, and we will be shining, living, and full of the Word. When we call on Him, He enters into us. We know that He has entered into us, because we are living, shining, joyful, uplifted, clear, and released. In our anguish He comforts, and in our grief He supplies. When we have such experiences, we know that we have received Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING GIVEN AUTHORITY<br />
TO BECOME CHILDREN OF GOD</h2>
<p>As many as receive Him, to them He gives authority to become children of God. Whenever we receive the Lord, we receive authority. Authority is the highest matter in the universe. Although power is a great thing, authority is even greater. The power of an atomic bomb can cause great destruction, but the authority to use this power lies in the hands of the president. A display of the power of an atomic bomb depends upon an order that is backed by the authority of the president. Similarly, a car has a powerful engine, but a traffic-control policeman has authority over its power. When a policeman gives an order based on his authority, all the power of a car on the street comes under his authority. Authority prevails over power.</p>
<p>When we received the Lord, He gave us not only power but also authority. When we contact the Lord and we receive the Lord in our experience, we have authority. A person who contacts the Lord is one who not only has power but also authority. This authority is the authority to become children of God. This authority enables us to enjoy everything of God and everything in the house of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING BEGOTTEN NOT OF BLOOD,<br />
NOR OF THE WILL OF THE FLESH,<br />
NOR OF THE WILL OF MAN, BUT OF GOD</h2>
<p>John 1:13 says, &ldquo;Who were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.&rdquo; Being begotten of God means that man receives God&rsquo;s nature. When we contact the Lord, God&rsquo;s nature increases in us, and the influence of our physical life, the will of our flesh, and the will of our created humanity decrease in us.</p>
<p>Our natural life, our life in the old creation, is summarized in three terms in verse 13: <em>blood, the will of the flesh,</em> and <em>the will of man.</em> According to the words in Greek, <em>blood</em> refers to the physical life of man, <em>the will of the flesh</em> refers to the will of fallen man, and <em>the will of man</em> refers to the will of created man. Although the will of man is slightly better than the will of the flesh, it is still related to man, including only the element of man. Hence, <em>not of blood</em> means not to be begotten of man&rsquo;s physical life; <em>nor of the will of the flesh</em> means not to be begotten of the will in man&rsquo;s fallen soul; and <em>nor of the will of man</em> means not to be begotten of anything related to man himself. A person who is not begotten of God can only be begotten of things related to man&mdash;blood, the will of the flesh, and the will of man.</p>
<p>We often tell the saints not to walk according to the elements of their natural man, but the more we exhort them not to live according to their physical life, the stronger this element becomes. Similarly, the more we exhort them not to live according their fallen will and human opinions, the more they express their will and opinions. The only way not to live according to our natural life is to contact the Lord. The more we draw near to the Lord, muse upon Him, praise Him, and worship Him, the more we are filled with Him, and the more we enjoy God&rsquo;s nature. When our living comes out of our being begotten of Him, we receive His authority as children of God (v. 12).</p>
<p>Our authority is God Himself, because God Himself is our life. He has given us authority to become children of God, who fully enjoy His life and His nature. This delivers us from the elements of our natural life, and the Holy Spirit even bears witness that we are begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man but of God. This is not a doctrine or a teaching but the spiritual experience of every child of God.</p>
<p>Being begotten of God has absolutely nothing to do with man&rsquo;s physical life, man&rsquo;s fallen soul, or man himself; rather, it involves God entering into man so that man may enjoy all His riches. We have authority to enjoy God every day by calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name, contacting the Lord, and receiving more of Him into us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A GLORIOUS MATTER</h2>
<p>Whenever we call upon the Lord, praise Him, and make mention of His name, we receive Him, and we are given the right, the authority, to enjoy God Himself. This is something that does not depend on our human life, our fallen will, or our created will. Instead, He enters into us to be our life, our nature, our substance, our riches, and our all. Even though we received Him at the time of our salvation, He is unlimited. Therefore, we need to enjoy Him even more and let Him increase in us more and more. If we need strength, He will be our strength. If we need power, He will be our power. If we need comfort, He will be our comfort. If we need leading, He will be our leading. If we need light, He will be our light. If we need a word, He will be our word. He is full of riches, and we can enjoy all His riches. Being a Christian is a matter of being begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</p>
<p>Consequently, we do not need to make resolutions, determine to do good, or desire to have power. When we enjoy Him, we have all that we need. Being a Christian is different from being an adherent of a religion. As a Christian, we do not need to improve ourselves or adjust ourselves; we only need to praise Christ more and fellowship with Him more by beholding Him, contacting Him, and calling on His name. Then we will be full of authority to enjoy our glorious Lord as life, and we will rejoice in Him, be at rest in Him, be full of praises to Him, and be shining and uplifted every day. God is life to shine in us, to speak in us, and to be our God in us. This is a glorious matter. &ldquo;As many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name, who were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.&rdquo; This is a glorious matter!</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> </body></html>
