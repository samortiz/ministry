   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>K. Revelation 17:11</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"And the beast who was and is not, he himself is also the eighth and is out of the seven and goes into perdition."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This verse has to be read in conjunction with 17:8.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 8 speaks of the four periods of the beast's history.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 11 also speaks of the four stages of the beast's history, which are: 1 he was, 2 he is not, 3 he is out of the seven, and 4 he goes into perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since the chronological characteristics of the first, second, and fourth periods in 17:11 correspond with those of the first, second, and fourth periods in 17:8, the third period of verse 11 must also correspond with the third period of verse 8.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, he will have to come up out of the abyss.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here it says that, on the one hand, this one is the eighth and, on the other hand, he is out of the seven.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, he comes up out of the abyss.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, he must be one of the seven who has resurrected to become the eighth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Which one of the seven is he?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>1 He is not the seventh one, because the seventh one has not yet come into the world 17:10 , but he was in the world before v. 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>2 He is not the sixth one, because the sixth one was still in the world at the time John was there.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to the prophecy, this one "is not" in the world at the time of John v. 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since he is not the seventh or the sixth, he could only be one of the first five.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Which one of these five is he?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From 13:18 we can tell that he must be Nero.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Revelation 17:8 tells us of the earthly position that Antichrist will occupy in the future, while verse 11 tells us of his royal position.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The seventh one is the forerunner of Antichrist, while the eighth will come in the resuscitated body of the seventh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Eight is the number of resurrection, but the resurrection of this one is different from the resurrection of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord is the resurrection Himself, while this one resurrects through the resuscitation of a corpse.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the Lord was on earth, the Jews chose the living Caesar over the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even after Christ resurrected, men still would not receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The coming Antichrist will be a resurrected Caesar, and men will choose such a resurrected Caesar over the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>L. Revelation 17:12</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings, who have not yet received a kingdom but receive authority as kings for one hour with the beast."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The "seven heads" are seven kings, and also the "ten horns" are ten kings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, there are differences between the heads and the horns:</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>1 Horns grow on the head.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, the horns must be smaller.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The head is the whole Roman Empire, while the horns are but vassal kings under Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In other words, they are the subordinate kings of the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>2 There is only one head at one time, all the heads being successive, but the horns are all kings at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>3 Among the seven heads, only one has not yet emerged, while all ten horns have yet to appear.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"Who have not yet received a kingdom."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This means that they had not yet received their kingdom at the time of John.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These ten will receive authority at the same time that the beast, the eighth king, receives his authority.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many have said that the ten kings refer to ten kingdoms.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is not accurate for the following reasons:</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>1 The matter of the ten kings has been explained by the angels; it cannot be further interpreted.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>2 If we change the word "kings" in 17:12 to kingdoms, it does not make sense.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>3 Since the beast is a man, the ten kings must also be men.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These ten kings are different from the other "kings of the earth" v. 2 :</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>1 The "kings of the earth" are on earth before the ten kings come, and while the ten kings are reigning, the former remain.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>2 The "kings of the earth" have always maintained a bond with the great harlot, but these ten kings never have any bond with the great harlot.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In fact, the great harlot is eventually destroyed by these ten kings 17:16 .</S>
