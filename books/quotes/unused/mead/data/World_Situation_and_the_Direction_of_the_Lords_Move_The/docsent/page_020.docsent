   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Maintaining a Good Order in the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Lord s recovery, on the one hand, we should keep the oneness of the Body of Christ, and on the other hand, we should maintain a good order in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For the Lord s recovery to remain in a proper condition, we need both the oneness and a good order.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By Abandoning Any Kind of Dictatorship</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must maintain a good order in the Body of Christ by abandoning any kind of dictatorship Matt 20:25-27; 23:8-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to Matthew 20 and 23, we all are brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is no rank among us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Ambition for higher rank in the Lord s recovery must be fully killed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By Subjecting Ourselves One to Another</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We abandon any kind of dictatorship, but we maintain a good order in the Body of Christ by subjecting ourselves one to another 1 Pet 5:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even the older ones should subject themselves to the younger ones.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have God as our Father, and we have Christ as our Lord and Head.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates that we should be a submissive people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although we are all brothers, Paul told us that we should obey the ones leading us and submit to them Heb 13:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church is not an anarchy, but on the other hand, in the church the elders should not lord it over the saints 1 Pet 5:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There needs to be a good order in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to 1 Peter 5:5, the younger men should be subject to elders, which includes all older men.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The young people among us need to practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The elders among us, on the other hand, should have no attitude or feeling of superiority.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need a good and beautiful order in the church, with all being subject to one another in the fear of Christ Eph 5:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>HAVING A SPECIAL TRAINING FOR FOUR MONTHS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>TO PREPARE AND EQUIP THE BURDENED ONES,</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>INCLUDING FULL-TIMERS, THOSE WITH A JOB</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>OR A BUSINESS, AND STUDENTS,</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>IN THE FOLLOWING MATTERS In Foreign Languages</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We will have a special training for four months to prepare and equip the burdened ones in foreign languages.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These languages at first will be German and Russian.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The more languages we can learn, the more useful we can be in the spread of the divine truths.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the Divine Truths</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We will also prepare and equip those who are burdened to go to Europe with an intensive study of the divine truths.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Manner of Life</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This special training will prepare the burdened ones in the manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The brothers among us need to learn to dress properly, as those who live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If a high-ranking person invited us to his home for dinner, we would surely go properly and appropriately dressed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to realize that the One who has invited us to the church meetings is the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is there waiting for us in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, we should dress properly when we attend the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The brothers should wear a proper tie and comb their hair properly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They should also shine their shoes regularly.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should pray about how to cut and style our hair.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The sisters, especially, need to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The appearance of the sisters means a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A sister in Christ should be comely in a proper way, remembering that she is one who fears God, worships God, lives Christ, and ministers Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the Personal Contacting of People</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The special training will also help the burdened ones in the personal contacting of people.</S>

   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to learn how to sit before people, especially before someone who is older than we are.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should also be very proper in contacting those of the other sex.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The sisters should remember their position in the Lord as females.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we behave ourselves properly in our contact with people, this will open the door for the gospel and the deeper truths.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Otherwise, the door will be shut.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Again, this shows that we need a change.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need the training.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>PRACTICING THE ONE ACCORD</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Finally, nothing is more crucial, vital, or valuable than the one accord for keeping the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must always endeavor to keep the oneness by practicing the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should always practice going along with others, not insisting on our way of doing things.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should not be back-seat drivers in the church life who are full of opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This does not mean that we should drop our discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When I do things by myself, I will take the top way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But when I go with others, I will take their way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should learn to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We also need to learn to teach the divine truths in the central lane of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I served the Lord with Brother Nee for eighteen years, and we never had any discrepancy in our teaching concerning Christ and the church in the central lane of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In our teachings we always practiced the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we open to the Lord and receive the fellowship in this book, I believe we will be blessed, we will enjoy the Lord to the uttermost, and we will be a living testimony to the people of Europe.</S>
