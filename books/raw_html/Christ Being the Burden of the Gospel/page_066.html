<h1 class="title">SERVICE ACCORDING TO REVELATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 9:1-9; 10:9-16; 13:2; Gal. 1:16; 2:1-2; Eph. 1:17</h1>
<h2 class="head1">SERVICE ACCORDING TO NATURE<br />
AND SERVICE ACCORDING TO REVELATION</h2>
<p>What is revelation? In Greek, the word <em>revelation</em> means &ldquo;unveiling,&rdquo; which is the opening of a covering, a veil, so that people can see what is inside. Therefore, to reveal is to open a veil so that others can see. In theology there are two categories of religion: natural religion and revealed religion. In this instance <em>religion</em> actually refers to service. Hence, we prefer to use the term <em>service</em> in this chapter.</p>
<p>Service according to nature is derived from the conditions of nature, and the knowledge concerning God that is associated with it is acquired through study and research. On the contrary, service according to revelation comes from God&rsquo;s direct speaking. All the religions in the world are related to the category of natural service. True worship and service are revealed by God Himself, and they bring us to Christ.</p>
<p>We can use medicine to see the difference between an understanding that is according to nature and an understanding that is according to revelation. If a sick person tries to determine the best remedy for his sickness based on his own research and analysis, rather than a doctor&rsquo;s judgment, his understanding will be incomplete and natural. However, if a sick person receives a prescription from a doctor who is able to confirm its benefits, the sick person&rsquo;s understanding of the medicine will be according to revelation. Natural service is incomplete and inaccurate, but service according to revelation comes directly from God; hence, its completeness and accuracy are beyond question.</p>
<p>The Bible is a record of God&rsquo;s revelation; it is God&rsquo;s opening the veil to reveal Himself to us. The Bible is like a prescription given to us by a doctor. Even though we have light from the Bible, there are still many people in Christianity who are involved only with natural service to God. We have to pay much attention to this matter.</p>
<p>Service according to revelation is a service that God grants us to see and touch. Service according to revelation is different from service according to doctrine. When I was in Kaohsiung recently, the brothers asked me to speak something, and I had a feeling to speak about consecration. The speaking was full of the anointing, and this speaking was according to revelation. However, if I were to give the same message in Taipei simply because I enjoyed much grace when I spoke in Kaohsiung, my service would be natural rather than according to revelation. My speaking in Kaohsiung was truly a service according to revelation, but if I spoke the same subject in Taipei without an inner leading, my speaking would be according to doctrine.</p>
<p>Any service that is rendered according to the will of man or according to the environment is a doctrinal service, a natural service, no matter how well it is done. Service according to revelation is a service that comes from contacting God and touching God&rsquo;s will in fellowship with Him. It is a service involving subjective spiritual experience.</p>
<p>Any service that results from the fashion of the times and from outward demands is natural service, not service according to revelation. If we receive an anointing as we open ourselves and fellowship with God, the resulting service will be according to revelation. We should not be influenced by the environment; instead, we need to have direct fellowship and contact with God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXAMPLES OF SERVICE ACCORDING TO REVELATION<br />
IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Example of Paul and Ananias</h2>
<p>Before Saul met the Lord on the way to Damascus, he served God zealously, but his service was a natural service. Before he met the Lord, he never truly touched God. However, on the way to Damascus, he heard a voice from heaven. Although he was zealous for God in the heavens, he thought that he was only persecuting Christians on the earth. When he heard the voice, he asked, &ldquo;Who are You, Lord?&rdquo; (Acts 9:5). In his mind Saul had been persecuting Stephen and John, not the Lord in heaven. Nevertheless, through the Lord&rsquo;s speaking, Saul realized that he was persecuting Jesus when he was persecuting Christians on earth. After he fell to the ground and was blinded, he was able to rise up only when others led him by the hand. The eyes of many in the world should similarly be blinded in order for them to learn dependence. Saul needed others to lead him by his hand, the same hand that arrested and persecuted Christians. He could no longer depend on himself. This was the start of his service according to revelation. Ananias&rsquo;s looking for Saul is also an example of service according to revelation (vv. 10-12).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Example of Peter</h2>
<p>Another example involves Peter&rsquo;s service. Even after spending three and a half years under the Lord&rsquo;s leading, Peter still could not break away from his natural service to preach the gospel to the Gentiles. However, when he received a revelation from God in chapter 10, he went to Cornelius&rsquo;s house to preach the gospel to the Gentiles. This service was according to revelation (vv. 9-16, 24-43). Service according to revelation is not derived from doctrinal consideration; it comes out of the revealed will of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOW TO RECEIVE REVELATION</h2>
<p>In order to receive revelation, we need to go before God and open to Him, consecrate everything to Him, and live in fellowship with Him. In this way we will receive revelation from Him. We should not hold on to our own views or be influenced by our background, traditions, customs, and circumstances. We should condemn whatever God shines on, and we should obey God&rsquo;s will. In this way, we will spontaneously receive revelation from Him. There must be the shining of light, and there must also be seeing in order for revelation to become a vision. All the service of a believer and of the church should be according to revelation.</p>
