   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE THE FUNCTIONS OF THE SPIRIT 5 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 1:21-22; 3:3, 6, 8, 17, 18b; 13:14; Gal 3:14; 5:16, 18, 22, 25; Eph 2:18; 3:16; Phil 1:19</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In message eight we saw the functions of the Spirit in Romans and 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we want to see the functions of the Spirit in 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, and Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Anointing, Sealing, and Pledging</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Spirit has the function of anointing, sealing, and pledging 2 Cor 1:21-22; 5:5; Eph 1:13-14; 4:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are being anointed with the Spirit as the compound ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Exodus 30 gives us a clear picture of the all-inclusive Spirit as the compound ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The very ointment with which God anoints us is the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before being processed and consummated, God had only divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He did not have humanity, nor had He passed through the processes of His human living, His all-inclusive death, His resurrection, or His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But today God has been processed and consummated to be the all-inclusive, compound Spirit typified by the compound ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As we have seen in message two, the ingredients of this compound ointment typify all the elements of Christ s person and work, which are included in the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The oil of the ointment signifies the Spirit of God with divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The very Spirit with whom we have been and are being anointed has been compounded with God s divinity and Christ s humanity, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Spirit as the oil, after being compounded, has become an ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This divine ointment, the Spirit, is the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may not have much apprehension or realization of this Spirit in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But gradually, we will enter into this apprehension and realization.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We will sense that the real humanity is in this compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The more we experience the compound Spirit, the more human we will be.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The humanity of Jesus is an element of the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some may want to be like angels, but it is much higher to be a man for the fulfillment of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The angels are merely our servants Heb 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Man Jesus with His humanity is included in the compound Spirit with which we are being anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God is anointing us with Himself as the compound ointment, the divine paint.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to receive coat after coat of this divine paint.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This painting is the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are being painted with the all-inclusive, compound Spirit as the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How many coats of the divine paint have we received?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We can realize that the Apostle Paul was anointed with many coats of the divine paint, the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He was being anointed by the Spirit continually.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to take him as our pattern by enjoying this anointing, this painting, day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All that God is, all that God has, all that God has accomplished, and all that God has done, is doing, and will do are compounded in this anointing ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Day after day this compounded Spirit is anointing us with Himself as the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The longer we remain in the Lord s recovery, the more of God we will gain.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We gain God by being anointed inwardly with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He anoints Himself, paints Himself, into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this way we are mingled together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Second Corinthians 1:21 and 22 say that God has anointed us, sealed us, and given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The anointing is God applying Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God is painting us with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I have been under this painting, this anointing, for about sixty-five years.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This anointing then becomes the sealing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To be sealed with the Spirit is to have the very processed, consummated Triune God as a mark upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The mark is God Himself as the compounded, sealing Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The seal of the Spirit indicates that we belong to God, that we are God s property, God s inheritance, God s asset.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On the one hand, we have been sealed with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the other hand, this sealing of God with Himself as the compounded Spirit has not ceased.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is still going on.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to Ephesians 4:30, this sealing will last until the redemption, the transfiguration, of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The transfiguration of our body is the issue of the sealing of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This sealing is going on and on within us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This sealing is another aspect of the anointing, the painting.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God s painting us with Himself puts a mark upon us, and that mark, that seal, is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Day by day, our God is still sealing us with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This sealing is a kind of saturating.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When a seal with ink is applied to paper, the paper is saturated with the sealing ink.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Likewise, when the Spirit as the living seal is applied to us, we are also saturated with Him as the divine ink.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>According to Ephesians 1:13-14 and 4:30, this sealing goes on until the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The seal of the Holy Spirit is living and works within us to permeate and transform us with God s divine element until we are matured in God s life and eventually fully redeemed in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Greek preposition for unto in Ephesians 4:30 may also be translated as for.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The sealing of the Spirit is going on within us for the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This means that the redemption of our body is the issue of the sealing of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The sealing of the Spirit continually increases within us until our entire being is sealed, issuing in the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When the sealing of the Spirit reaches our body, our body will be redeemed and we will be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Our rapture is the consummate step of God s salvation in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The sealing of the Spirit and the redeeming are one.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Whatever God seals, He redeems.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As the sealing of the Spirit is going on within us, God s subjective redemption of our being is also going on.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>With the sealing of the Spirit is the pledging of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>On the one hand, we are God s inheritance, God s possession.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Therefore, God put Himself upon us as a seal.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>On the other hand, God is our inheritance, our possession, our property, our real estate.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We know that God is our possession because we have Him as our pledge, our guarantee.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The pledge is the consummated, compounded Spirit given to us as the firstfruit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Romans 8:23 mentions the firstfruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Today the pledge of the Spirit is the firstfruit, the foretaste, of the Spirit, and the full taste is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The full taste is guaranteed by the foretaste.</S>
