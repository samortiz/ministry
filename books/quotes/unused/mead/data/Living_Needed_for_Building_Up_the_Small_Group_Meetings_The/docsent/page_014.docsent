   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EVERYONE SPEAKING IN THE MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Corinthians 14:26 says, Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let all things be done for building up.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Psalms are for singing, and teachings are for speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The proper way to meet is not in the way of Christianity where one speaks and all listen.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is in the way of every saint speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Each has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, and even has an interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Each one of these five items involves speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One is even speaking with the words of psalms, that is, with words of praises to God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although I am speaking here tonight, I am not satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I hope very much that every one of you sitting here would compete to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Moreover, I hope that they would not be long speakings, but would be in the way where I speak a few sentences, you speak a few sentences, and every one stands up and speaks a few sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some may stand up to sing a hymn; another may stand up to read a song.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If this is the case, our meeting will become living and enjoyable, and you will see the riches of Christ displayed here.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I hope that every one of us would see this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First Corinthians 12:7-8 says, But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for profit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For to one through the Spirit is given a word of wisdom, and to another a word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First we have the word of wisdom, then we have the word of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here we see that in a meeting there should not be only one speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, all the brothers and sisters should speak.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Spirit is already operating in us; we cannot say that we have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To each one of us is given the manifestation of the Spirit, and we all have a word of wisdom and a word of knowledge to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>MEETING IN THE LORD S NAME AND BY CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Matthew 18:20 says, For where two or three are gathered together in My name.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The preposition here should not be in, but should be into.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must be gathered together into His name.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Every time we meet together we are gathering together into His name.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Wherever two or three gather together, we have a small group meeting, and we are told that we must meet into the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the Bible, especially in the New Testament, the name denotes the person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, to meet into the name of the Lord is to meet into the Person of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ is the center of our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is also the content of our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We do not gather with any other center or content.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ is our unique center and content.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For this reason when we come together, we have the inner sense that we are gathering together into the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many times when we read the Bible or pray at home, we experience a certain measure of enjoyment and sweetness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But this enjoyment is different from that which we enjoy in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The flavor of our enjoyment at home is not that strong.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But when we come to the meeting, the flavor is much stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is because we are gathering together into the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is what it means to have a living of meeting by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>SPEAKING IN THE MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>TO RELEASE OUR SPIRITS</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today Christ is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Furthermore, He is living in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>First Corinthians 6:17 says, He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit, and 2 Timothy 4:22 says, The Lord be with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore we all must exercise in our speaking to release this spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If I come to you today and stand before you silently, no matter how much I look at you, my spirit will not be released.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How can I release my spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I must open my mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As soon as I open my mouth, the spirit comes out.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I often say that if one does not know what it is to release his spirit, all he has to do is to lose his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you would say, I just hate you! right away your spirit will be released.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When you talk politely with others, your spirit will not come out.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But if you shout in your anger, your spirit will be released.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Of course that release of the spirit is not the proper kind.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But the principle is there, and it is very applicable.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When you open your mouth to release one or two sentences in the meeting, your spirit must be released.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>That means you have to utter something from the depths of your being.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You must use your mouth, because your spirit is connected to your mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When you speak some words, the words will carry the spirit with them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When you shout in your temper, the spirit of anger will come out through the words of anger.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Christian meeting is a part of our entertainment in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Moreover, this meeting is one where we meet into the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord is the Spirit; hence, for us to meet into Him is for us to meet into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This Spirit is today in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In order for this Spirit to come out, there is no other way than to open our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Brothers and sisters, if you do not open your mouth, even God has no way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Although you can have a strong wind blowing outside, without opening the windows, there is no way to have any air.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Today the Triune God has been incarnated, has died, and has risen from the dead to become the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This Spirit has been breathed into us John 20:22 , and has also been poured out upon us Acts 2:1-4; 10:44-46; 1 Cor 12:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But there is no response on our side.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is our problem.</S>
