   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>But there is an obvious problem a wall exists between her and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The wall encloses her, and it keeps the Lord out.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Yet she does not see anything wrong with the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As a result, she does not say "my wall," but "our wall," meaning that the wall belongs to both her and to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>She intends for that wall to enclose herself and the Lord and to keep the world and everything else out.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then she would have fellowship with the Lord and rest in Him and live happily within the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>She would be able to find the Lord within her heart all the time, and she could ignore circumstances, persons, the brothers and sisters, daily duties, and many trials.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>She could turn inward to the Lord and forget about the world.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>She only knows the sweetness of fellowship, but does not know the power of work and the fierceness of warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is only the thought of making three tents on the mountain, and no thought is given to the mass of sinners at the base of the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Demons can be with the sinners at the base of the mountain, as long as the Lord is within her heart on the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It may be true that she has the Lord's presence, but the life within the "tents" has deprived sinners from experiencing deliverance from the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In other words, she is always turning inward to seek the joy of the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is her wall.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a danger believers face after they have realized that Christ lives within them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Spiritually speaking, this does not mean that the Lord can leave our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Being behind the wall means two things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First, the Lord is standing, not sitting.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Previously, He was sitting at the table.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now He is ready to make a move.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Standing is the first step a person takes before moving.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Just as sitting leads to rest, standing leads to work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Second, it means that the Lord is outside.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The power of resurrection is able to leap over the mountains and skip over the hills.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, we should not keep Him within the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The maiden needs to learn to let go of the Lord within and allow Him to lead her out.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>She should not try to hold on to the Lord with her own strength, but she should allow the Lord to lead her on.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>She should learn to trust in the Lord's word and to follow Him by exercising her faith to leap over the mountains and skip over the hills.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>She should learn to live by something other than just the feeling of the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thank the Lord, even though man can put up a wall, God can set apart some windows for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If there are not any large windows, there will at least be some small lattices.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God can always find a way to enlighten the heart of those who have consecrated themselves to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This wall is the wall of our introspection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It causes us to miss the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But God has set apart windows and lattices for Himself for us to see through.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A wall means an attempt to keep the Lord within.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When this happens, the world is kept out.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord is trying to deliver the maiden out of this condition.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is teaching her to realize that His presence can be found under any circumstance; there is no need to look for Him only within herself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>She should learn to know Christ more from the environment than from within.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord is omnipresent.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Andrew Murray once said that the Lord's presence should be felt not only in our prayer, but in our factory as well.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What is the Lord doing outside the wall?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is standing and waiting to make a move.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, a person who is constantly looking inward and who concentrates on his own feeling of joy cannot understand anything even after he has learned the Lord's thought.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although he may hear the Lord's voice, he will not understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord has to speak again before he can understand anything clearly.</S>
