   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CARING FOR THE LORD S</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PLEASURE AND SATISFACTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to be those who care for the Lord s pleasure and satisfaction, and we all must believe the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By believing in His word, we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He not only tells us that if we believe in Him, our sins will be forgiven, we shall be cleansed, and we shall have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His word also tells us that it is not worthwhile to gain the whole world and lose our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should be wise, not foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do not be shortsighted, saying, I don t care for tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I care only for today.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must be enlightened by the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the coming age the gaining of the soul will mean a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even if we had the whole world, we could not buy this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order to gain the soul in the coming age, it is worthwhile to lose our soulish joy in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As long as we have what is necessary for our existence food, clothing, lodging, and transportation we should be content.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is sufficient that we can exist and live on earth for the Lord s testimony, loving Him, contacting Him, receiving Him, digesting Him, and living Him out to be His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should be happy with this and not pursue other things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should be able to say that we do not care for food, clothing, cars, and houses.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We live in Him and trust in Him to take care of our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But we do not care for today s enjoyment, entertainment, and amusement.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, we care for His pleasure and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For the Lord s sake, we are willing to drop so many amusements and pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We care to have only what is necessary to exist for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is what it means to lose the soul for the Lord s sake.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we do this, He will say to us at His coming back, Well done, good and faithful servant.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Enter into the joy of your Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the gaining, the saving, of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we lose our soul for His sake today, He will reward us with the saving of our soul in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if we save our soul today, we shall lose it in the coming age and suffer some type of punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whether we shall save our soul or lose it in the future depends upon whether we save it or lose it today.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>TWO PRACTICAL ILLUSTRATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As the children of God and saints in the Lord, we should love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Suppose you have a large savings account in the bank and another brother is very poor and needs help.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to the Lord s sovereignty, this brother s need is brought to your attention.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord may burden you to give this brother a large amount of money, but you may be unwilling to do so, not wanting to lose the pleasure of having a certain amount in your bank account.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead of giving your brother the money the Lord tells you to give, you may reason with the Lord about it, trying to lower the amount.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you do this, you will be saving your soul.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Such a thing once happened in China.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord burdened one brother to give a certain amount of money to another.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But the enemy tempted him to lower the amount.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the brother was enlightened to see the tactics of the enemy, he said, Satan, if you speak to me about this again, I ll give everything away.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I am happy to have nothing in my savings account.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To lose our pleasure at having a large savings account is to lose our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We may also either save or lose our soul in buying a suit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To buy a new suit may be an enjoyment to your soul.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Will you save your soul by buying an expensive suit, or will you lose it by buying one that is adequate but much less expensive?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you are willing to buy the less expensive suit, you will be able to save some money for the Lord s sake.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even in this small matter you will be losing your soul.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>LOSING THE SOUL AND TRANSFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we lose our soul and its enjoyment, we are undergoing the process of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Suppose a brother does not care for the Lord in buying a suit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He cares only to satisfy his soulish enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Such a person cannot be transformed in his disposition, will, or emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, if he cares for the Lord and buys a suit under the leading of the Holy Spirit, his soul will be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The losing of the soul today actually transforms the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But the saving of our soul today frustrates the transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we lose our soul in all things related to our daily living, we shall be gradually transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then when the Lord comes back, He will say, Well done, good servant; come into My joy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>At that time your soul will be fully transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You will be prepared, perfected, and qualified to enter into the Lord s enjoyment because over the years your soul has been transformed through your willingness to lose the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But if you are not willing to lose your soul in this age, your soul will not be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>THE IMPLANTED WORD AND A RICH ENTRANCE</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>James 1:21 says, Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and abounding of wickedness, and receive in meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>. If we are willing to lose our soul, the word will be implanted into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The word we have heard in the Bible or in messages will be implanted within us and work for the transformation of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As a result, we shall be rewarded with the saving of our soul when the Lord Jesus comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As we lose our soul in all sorts of situations, the word will be implanted into our being to transform our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This will make us ready when the Lord Jesus comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We shall be transformed and qualified to be the Lord s partners in His reign in the coming kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is the saving of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Second Peter 1:11 says, For so an entrance shall be supplied unto you richly into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>. We all need a rich entrance into the eternal kingdom of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We can have such an entrance by losing our souls today.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The more we lose the enjoyment of the soul, the richer an entrance we shall have.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We have seen that although we have been saved in our spirit, we still need the salvation of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Now is the time for us to lose our soul that we may gain it at the Lord s coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We need to lose everything that makes our soul happy.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>By losing our soul, our entire being will be daily and gradually transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Then we shall have the position to be rewarded with the saving of the soul in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Outwardly we shall save our soul at the Lord s coming, and inwardly we shall be qualified to participate in the Lord s enjoyment in the coming age.</S>
