   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>David said, "O God of my righteousness;/You made room for me when I was in straits" Psa 4:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God allowed David to fall into straits in order that he would be enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>James 2:5 says, "Listen, my beloved brothers: Did not God choose the poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which He promised to those who love Him?"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God chose the poor of this world in order that they could be rich in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God has no intention to always leave His children in distress.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He has no intention to leave them in poverty all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He intends to enlarge His children through straits and enrich them in faith through poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Revelation 21 tells us of the future condition of the church before God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What kind of condition will it be?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The New Jerusalem will have "the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Her light was like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, as clear as crystal" v. 11 . "And the building work of its wall was jasper; and the city was pure gold, like clear glass.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every precious stone" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"And the city lies square, and its length is as great as the breadth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>And he measured the city with the reed to a length of twelve thousand stadia; the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal" v. 16 . This shows us the riches and the enlargement of the church when it appears before God one day.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What does it mean to be enlarged?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Psalm 4:1 tells us that while one is in straits, God can enlarge him until he can enjoy God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that enlargement brings in the enjoyment of God, and that straits will never press one down.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those who see the fourth person walking in the midst of the fiery furnace Dan 3:25 are the ones who enjoy God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Such persons are enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those who are imprisoned and whose feet are secured in the locks, yet still pray and sing hymns of praise to God Acts 16:24-25 , are the ones who enjoy God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Such ones are the enlarged ones.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although the gate of the prison was locked, those who were inside could still enjoy the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These are the enlarged ones.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Spirit enlarges us through distress.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Unfortunately, sometimes when we are in distress, we cannot deliver ourselves out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We know that the Lord allowed Job to suffer in order to bring him to the Lord's end James 5:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Job indeed reached the Lord's end. But unfortunately, many people end themselves before they reach the Lord's end! Some stumble in their trials while they are being tried.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They are in distress, but they are not enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some murmur against God the minute they are tried; they complain that God is not being fair to them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a result, they are trapped by their own trials, and they are not enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some Christians are not in distress, yet they are very poor.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They lack spiritual reality, and what they have is not sufficient for their own use, much less for helping others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, some Christians are rich, and one cannot fathom their depth or exhaust their measure.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When anyone brings their problems to them, they can always render some help.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It seems as though no problem is unsolvable before them, and it seems as if no one who goes to them comes away without receiving help.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One can only bow his head and thank the Lord for giving such rich ones to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Their riches are greater than the problems and poverty of others; they are well able to render the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They are rich; therefore, they can render the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They are rich because they have touched reality.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whether or not a church can be the golden lampstand and a testimony depends on how many enlarged believers are in that church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It depends on how many believers are rich in faith, who can supply others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When a friend comes to us at midnight to borrow loaves, and we have nothing to set before him, we can go and knock on our other friend's door Luke 11:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But sometimes, when others need the loaves, the Lord tells us, "You give them something to eat" Matt 14:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How many loaves do we really have?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We can often pray for provisional supplies, and the Lord can grant mercy to us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But provisional prayers cannot replace riches.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we do not have any increase in spiritual riches over a year or even five years, we are indeed in poverty!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What is the reason for our poverty?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The reason lies in the lack of discipline from the Spirit and the lack of restrictions of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must remember that every enlarged person has gone through some experiences before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They have a certain amount of history before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Their experiences and history become the riches of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many sicknesses are present in order to increase the riches of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many problems are present in order to increase the riches of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Many obstacles and hardships are present in order to increase the riches of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many Christians live in peace, yet their end is spiritual poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When other brothers and sisters are faced with problems, they cannot understand and render any spiritual help to them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They do not have a history before God, and the Holy Spirit has no opportunity to manifest the reality of Christ through them or to wrought Christ into them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They may have heard many teachings, but teachings cannot replace the work of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>With those who do not have the work of the Spirit, the Lord's riches cannot become their riches, and they have nothing to give to others.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, whether or not we are useful in God's hand depends on whether the Holy Spirit has done a work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A Christian must not be so fallen as to have no intervention from the Holy Spirit, as if he is destined to poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We believe that the Lord does not let go of anyone who commits himself into His hands.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We believe that every trial is for enlarging and enriching us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Once a man passes through a trial, he becomes that much richer.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Every time a man faces a distress, he knows God that much more.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In this way, he becomes gradually qualified to supply God's children in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>One sister was saved at the age of thirteen and lived until she was a hundred and three.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When she was a hundred years old, a brother went to her and asked why God had kept her on earth for so long.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>She answered quietly, "God leaves me here to pray and pray."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>She was indeed a rich person!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Another sister was bedridden for forty years, of which thirty-five years she could not hear anything.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When a brother went to see her, she said, "I was once very active, running busily here and there.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But I neglected the crucial work of prayer in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I have been lying here for forty years and every day I fulfill the work of prayer."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>She did not become angry, impatient, or murmur.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>On the contrary, she accomplished wonderful works.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Her distress had enlarged and enriched her, and her riches had become the riches of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Some brothers and sisters are not that eloquent in the church; they are not that knowledgeable, yet they can pray.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Whenever they hear about something, they pray for it.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>They pray for the sick and pray for the saints who are in trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>They continue to supply the church through their prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Some brothers and sisters only meet; they never pray.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Or they only listen to messages; they never pray.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>These ones have nothing to give to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>They have not passed through the discipline of the Spirit and do not know what spiritual reality is.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>They are poor.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Some brothers and sisters, in the eyes of man, ought to have been crushed.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Yet they are still not crushed because some others have been supplying them.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Hence, the riches of life are not a matter of words of doctrine, but a matter of going through something before the Lord to the extent that one renders the supply to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Day by day, the Spirit is seeking the opportunity to lead us into spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If we do not accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit, He will not have the opportunity to lead us into spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Often when difficulties come, some choose the easy way, and others try to circumvent the proper path.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>They may bypass the difficulties, but they have lost their opportunity for the Holy Spirit to lead them into spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The Spirit will not have the chance to work in them to the extent that their portion becomes the church's. If a person runs away from the discipline of the Holy Spirit, he cannot expect to enter into spiritual reality; instead, he will lose his chance of being enlarged and enriched.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Brothers and sisters, we must accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit before we can be enlarged and before we can supply the church.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We need a more complete and thorough consecration so that the Lord's Spirit can have the opportunity to do His work in us and lead us into spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>May we learn something more day by day before the Lord, and may we have more deposit day by day, so that what we have learned and deposited within will become the riches of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>These riches will one day be manifested in the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Brothers and sisters, no gold or precious stone can escape the fire, and no pearl can come about without some pain.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Let us pray that the Lord would deliver us from vain talk and all kinds of poverty, and let us ask Him to show us more and more what spiritual reality is.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>May the Lord lead us through His Spirit into all spiritual reality.</S>
