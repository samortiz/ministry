   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us now consider some of the details of Christ s resurrection as presented in chapter twenty-eight of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 1 says, Now late on the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, Mary the Magdalene and the other Mary came to look at the grave.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ was resurrected on the first day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This signifies that His resurrection brought a new start with a new age for the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>B. Discovered by Mary the Magdalene</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>and the Other Mary</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The resurrection of Christ was firstly discovered by two sisters, Mary the Magdalene and the other Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They discovered it by loving the Lord to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then they became the first two witnesses of the Lord s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>C. Pointed Out by the Angel</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ s resurrection was pointed out by an angel vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>2-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 2 says, And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended out of heaven and came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The earthquake signifies that the earth, the base of Satan s rebellion, has been shaken by the Lord s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The angel came to confirm the Lord s resurrection by rolling away the stone that was sealed and to explain the resurrection to His seekers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The coming of the angel, which terrified the guards, indicates the power of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All this implies the authority mentioned in verse 18.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to verses 5 and 6, the angel said to the women, Fear not, for I know that you seek Jesus, Who has been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is not here, for He was raised, as He said.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What good news this was!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What glad tidings!</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Behold, I have told you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As the heavenly King began His ministry from Galilee of the Gentiles 4:12-17 , not from Jerusalem, the holy city of the Jewish religion, so after His resurrection, He would still go to Galilee, not to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This strongly indicated that the resurrected King had fully abandoned Judaism and initiated a new era for God s economy of the New Testament.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>E. Rumors of the Jewish Leaders</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verses 11 through 15 indicate that the Jewish leaders with the Roman soldiers spread a false rumor about Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They gave the soldiers a large sum of money to say that the Lord s disciples came by night and stole Him away while the guards slept.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This word from the mouth of the religious leaders was a bare lie, indicating the lowest standard and falsehood of their religion.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In verse 14 they said to the soldiers, And if this be heard by the governor, we will persuade him and free you from worry.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The evil religionists always persuade the evil politicians to carry out falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verse 15 indicates that this false saying was spread abroad among the Jews until this day.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As the lie concerning the Lord s resurrection was spread abroad, so were the rumors concerning His followers and His church after His resurrection Acts 24:5-9; 25:7 .</S>
