<h2 class="head1">A BIOGRAPHY OF THE BELIEVERS</h2><p>When we study the Gospel of Mark, we are actually studying our own biography. This means that the biography of Jesus is also our biography. In the words of a hymn, &ldquo;He is my history,&rdquo; and &ldquo;His life is my experience&rdquo; (<i>Hymns,</i>#949). Therefore, the biography narrated in Mark is not only a biography of the individual Jesus but also a biography of the believers.</p><p>In particular, the Gospel of Mark is a biography of Peter, our representative. Peter is present in the first chapter of Mark, and his name is specifically mentioned in the last chapter: &ldquo;But go, tell His disciples and Peter that He is going before you into Galilee&rdquo; (16:7). Furthermore, the cases in this book are a composite portrait of us as represented by Peter. For example, on the Mount of Transfiguration Peter said, &ldquo;Rabbi, it is good for us to be here. And let us make three tabernacles&mdash;one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah&rdquo; (9:5). Because Peter is our representative, his speaking here is also our speaking. Likewise, when Peter denied the Lord three times, that was also our threefold denial of the Lord. The angel&rsquo;s word concerning Peter in 16:7 is also a word concerning us. As we read this verse, it is correct to insert our name in the place of Peter&rsquo;s name, since we are represented by him.</p><p>From the time Peter was called by the Lord Jesus in 1:16 and 17, he was captured by Him and was always with Him. Along with James and John, he was with the Lord on the Mount of Transfiguration. This indicates that wherever the Lord Jesus went, Peter went with Him, for the Lord brought Peter with Him.</p><p>Do you believe that when the Lord Jesus was crucified, He left Peter and the other disciples? No, when the Lord Jesus was crucified and buried, Peter, the representative of us all, was crucified with Him. Moreover, the Lord Jesus was not resurrected alone. According to God&rsquo;s point of view, which is beyond the elements of space and time, we all were included in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection.</p><h2 class="head1">PUT INTO CHRIST BY GOD</h2><p>First Corinthians 1:30 says that it is of God that we are in Christ. When were we put into Christ by God? Ephesians 1:4 says that God chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world. This indicates that in eternity God chose us in Christ. That must have been the starting point of God&rsquo;s putting us into Christ. Therefore, we were put into Christ by God when He chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world.</p><p>One day the Christ in whom we were chosen by God in eternity came to us and called us. In chapter one of the Gospel of Mark Christ called Peter (1:16-18). Here the Lord seems to be saying, &ldquo;Peter, I am the Christ in whom you were chosen by God the Father. Now I come to you to carry out the Father&rsquo;s choice. He has already put you into Me. Why do you remain here fishing? Come, follow Me.&rdquo;</p><p>The Father had selected Peter in Christ before the foundation of the world. Thus, from God&rsquo;s view in eternity, Peter was already in Christ. But in Mark 1 the Lord came to Peter in order to carry out the Father&rsquo;s choice.</p><p>From the time the Lord called Peter, He brought him with Him wherever He went. When the Lord was arrested and judged, Peter also was arrested and judged. When the Lord was crucified, resurrected, and exalted, Peter also was crucified, resurrected, and exalted.</p><p>If we had only the Gospel of Mark, it would not be possible for us to have such an understanding of Peter&rsquo;s relationship to the Lord. But in the Epistles we see that Christ died on the cross as an all-inclusive One, as the One who included in Himself all whom God had chosen. Therefore, God&rsquo;s chosen ones were included in Christ&rsquo;s death, burial, resurrection, and ascension. We all need to see this.</p>
