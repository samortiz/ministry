   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The meetings of the church should be a testimony of our daily living and our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is the testimony of our meetings?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What do the visitors see when they come to the meetings?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do they simply see us shouting, pray-reading, and calling on the name of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In our meetings we need to have some genuine testimonies of our experience of Christ and enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, whenever the visitors come to our meetings and observe what is taking place, they will be convinced that this is the testimony of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>My present concern for all the churches is that we would have the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If people can see only our shouting and excitement, then we must be short of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If so, we have lost the Lord's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the meetings we must have something real, solid, practical, convincing, and subduing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The visitors need to be impressed with the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whenever a visitor comes to the meeting, he should be convinced and subdued and say, "Here is the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is not just a group of people shouting, singing, and praising, for the reality of Christ as life is among them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In their testimonies they all tell of how they are experiencing Christ in their daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, when they come together they have much of Christ to present to God."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we are like this, our meetings will be the exhibition of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What God desires today is such a testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>PAUL'S GOAL</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Philippians 3 Paul did not think that he had yet reached the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, he pursued Christ by forgetting the things past and stretching forth to the things before.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul's goal was the top experience of Christ, the fullest portion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our goal in the church life should be the best experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we reach this goal, we shall be filled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then we shall receive the reward of the out-resurrection from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because we are outstanding in the experience of Christ and are filled with Christ to the uttermost, we receive the reward of the out-resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the accurate meaning of this portion of the Word.</S>
