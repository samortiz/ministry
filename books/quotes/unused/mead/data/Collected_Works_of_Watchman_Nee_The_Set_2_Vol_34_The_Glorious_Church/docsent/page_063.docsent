   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Lord symbolizes the messengers as stars.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This means they possess a heavenly position and experience like the stars in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They testify for the Lord and shine for the Lord like the stars at night.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Their hope and happiness are in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They have intimate fellowship with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They also have the power and authority of the Lord, because they are in the right hand of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They represent the church, because they are the most faithful ones in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They mind the things of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They view the failure and success of the church as their own.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They bear in their hearts the responsibility of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whoever wants to be useful in the hand of the Lord must be on his knees, with tears, and with an outpoured soul, interceding for the church of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although the failures of the churches are not our own, yet it will be our failure if we are unconcerned about their failures.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should have an enlarged heart to include all the children of God, viewing their business as our business.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Otherwise, we will not only put ourselves in danger, but we will break the Lord's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What a tragedy!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we are willing to submit ourselves totally to the Lord's hand and gladly bear the responsibility for His sake, not only will we receive the Lord's reward, but the Lord will also use us to accomplish great work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should know that God is just.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He will not misjudge those who are faithful to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord saw the faithfulness of Smyrna and Philadelphia, and He commended them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To the other five churches, the Lord had words of reproach.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even though the messengers represent the churches, and even though they bear much responsibility, in reality the messengers are the messengers and the churches are the churches, because there are differences between the stars and the lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In responsibility, the Lord holds the messengers accountable.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, in judgment, the Lord would only punish those who commit sins 2:5, 16, 22-23; 3:3, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord knows who belongs to Him and who are faithful to the end.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should be aware of another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the Lord's words to the churches, there are both judgments and warnings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The words of warning and judgment are for the churches, but they are also for the messengers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A church can fail, and a messenger can fail.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even the stars that are in the Lord's right hand can fail.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"You have a name that you are living, and yet you are dead" 3:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The stars in the Lord's right hand can so utterly fail that they keep the Lord knocking outside the door v. 20 . What a solemn thought this is! Everyone who is greatly used by the Lord and everyone who bears serious responsibility in the church should not be proud, unwatchful, or unfaithful.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord said, "The seven lampstands are the seven churches."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In regard to the seven churches which are represented by the seven lampstands, we should understand three things: 1 The seven churches were real churches existing at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>2 The seven churches represent the sevenfold history of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>3 The conditions of the seven churches exist simultaneously in the church's sevenfold history.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 1:4 says, "John to the seven churches which are in Asia."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This proves that John wrote the seven letters to actual churches that existed at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should not think that Christ's coming required the conditions of these seven churches to become seven actual periods in the history of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord said to His church, "Nevertheless what you have hold fast until I come."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"Become watchful....If therefore you will not watch, I will come as a thief" 2:25; 3:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This proves that even in those days there was the possibility of the Lord's second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord's word in 1:19 concerning "the things which are" refers to the seven churches.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The things of the seven churches actually occurred in those days.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There was a possibility of His second coming then!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, we also know that there were more than seven churches at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The seven churches were not the only ones that needed admonishing, warning, and encouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Should not the well-known churches, such as Antioch, have received epistles also?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But the Lord only chose seven churches to receive His special exhortations.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Is this not full of significance?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In considering the conditions of the seven churches, we need to see that the Lord chose them with the intention of unveiling His will concerning all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>By using seven churches, the Lord demonstrated the condition of all the churches from the time of the apostles to His second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the original text, there is no definite article before these seven churches.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This indicates that the Lord was not just pointing to these seven churches.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They represent all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The number seven also means completeness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>These seven churches represent all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If the seven lampstands represented only seven churches at that time, were the other churches not counted as churches?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Not at all.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The seven churches, represented by the seven golden lampstands, were representatives of all the churches in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Furthermore, each of the seven letters includes the words, "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This clearly indicates that the message was not written just for the people at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This word was spoken for those in the past as well the present; it was spoken to anyone who has an ear to hear the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, the seven churches represent all the churches on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord did not explicitly state that the seven churches represented the churches in consecutive generations because He wants us to be watchful, for we do not know when He will come Mark 13:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Although the conditions of the seven churches aptly represent the history of the church on earth, it does not mean that Smyrna came only after Ephesus had passed away, and that Pergamos followed after Smyrna had gone.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In general the first age in church history corresponds to the condition of Ephesus, and the second age corresponds to the condition of Smyrna.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But in the age of Ephesus the conditions of Smyrna and the other five churches were already present.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, the condition of Ephesus was more dominant.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the age of Smyrna, there were also the conditions of Ephesus and all the other churches, but the condition of Smyrna predominated in that age.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The church in every age bears the characteristics of all the other churches, just as all seven churches existed simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Lord Jesus spoke to the church in Thyatira, "Nevertheless what you have hold fast until I come" Rev 2:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He spoke to the messenger of the church in Sardis, "I will come as a thief" 3:3 , and He spoke to Philadelphia, "I come quickly" v. 11 . The Lord Jesus spoke to these three churches regarding His coming again.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Therefore, they will remain until His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The church in Laodicea is the last church.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It will also co-exist with the other three churches until the Lord's coming.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Lord told the three churches Thyatira, Sardis, and Philadelphia about His coming in a way that clearly shows that His coming is nearer and nearer.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He said to the church in Thyatira, "Until I come."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Here it seems that His coming is still far away.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He said to the church in Sardis, "I will come."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is more definite.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He said to the church in Philadelphia, "I come quickly."</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is even more urgent.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Hence, we need to prepare ourselves watchfully for our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The final four of the seven churches will exist until the Lord comes.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This does not mean that they were raised up at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It means that Thyatira was raised up first, followed by Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The former did not come to an end because the latter was raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The four will continue together until the Lord comes.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In other words, their beginning was different, but their consummation will be together.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>At the beginning of this message we said that the central purpose of our studying the book of Revelation is to know Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Brothers and sisters, spiritually speaking, we should either have no ambition at all, or if we have ambition, it should be a desire to learn and pursue with those who know the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Knowing the Lord is not an empty word.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Everyone who knows the Lord prostrates himself before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The Lord can only commission those who prostrate themselves before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Brothers and sisters, how about our knowledge of the Lord today?</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>What is our burden for the church today?</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Brothers and sisters, if we are faithful, if we hold fast what we have, and if we stand fast in the faith, we will shine as a star, and we will become useful in the right hand of the Lord.</S>
