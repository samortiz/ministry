   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE EPISTLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verses 25 through 28 we have the conclusion of this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 25 says, "Brothers, pray concerning us."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Is it not surprising that Paul would ask those who have been in the Lord less than a year to pray for him?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Would you have asked such young believers to pray for you?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul's request in this verse for prayer can be compared to a grandfather asking his young grandchild to pray for him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Nevertheless, Paul asked new believers, those who had been in the Lord for only a short time, to pray for the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul knew that, no matter how little was their experience in prayer, it still would be helpful for them to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By this we see that we should not despise the new ones or the young ones.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the contrary, we should ask them to pray for us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verses 26 and 27 Paul says, "Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I adjure you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the brothers."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some manuscripts insert the word "holy" before brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This would mean that since this Epistle is concerned with the holy life of the believers, the apostle in his concluding charge calls the believers holy brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul's concluding word is this: "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Grace is God in the Son as our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to John 1:17, "The law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The law makes demands on man according to what God is, but grace supplies man with what God is to meet what God demands.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No man can partake of God through the law, but grace is the enjoyment of God for man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, grace is God enjoyed by man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In 1 Corinthians 15:10 we have a further word concerning grace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here Paul says, "But by the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me was not in vain, but I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God with me."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Grace in this verse is the resurrected Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit to bring the processed God in resurrection into us to be our life and life supply that we may live in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, grace is the Triune God becoming life and everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The grace that motivated Paul and operated in him was not a matter or a thing, but a living Person, the resurrected Christ, the embodiment of God the Father becoming the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, who dwelt in Paul as his everything.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is only when we enjoy the Lord as grace that we can live a holy life for the church life, a life that is genuine and proper for the church by the Lord as the life supply.</S>
