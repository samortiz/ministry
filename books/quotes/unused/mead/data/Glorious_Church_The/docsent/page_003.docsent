   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God's purpose is to gain a group of people who are like His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we read Romans 8:29 we find God's purpose: "Because those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God desires to have many sons, and God desires all these sons to be like that one Son of His.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then His Son will no more be the only Begotten, but the Firstborn among many brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's desire is to gain such a group of people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we see this, we will realize the preciousness of man, and we will rejoice whenever man is mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How God values man!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even He Himself became a man!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God's plan is to gain man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When man is gained by God, God's plan is accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is by man that God's plan is fulfilled, and through man His own need is met.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What, then, does God require from the man whom He created?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is that man should rule.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When God created man, He did not predestine man to fall.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Man's fall is in chapter three of Genesis, not chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In God's plan to create man, He did not predestine man to sin, neither did He foreordain redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are not minimizing the importance of redemption, but only saying that redemption was not foreordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If it were, then man would have to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God did not foreordain this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In God's plan to create man, man was ordained to rule.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is revealed to us in Genesis 1:26.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here God unveils to us His desire and tells us the secret of His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is God's purpose in creating man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Perhaps some may ask why God has such a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is because an angel of light rebelled against God before man's creation and became the devil: Satan sinned and fell; the Daystar became the enemy of God Isa 14:12-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God, therefore, withdrew His authority from the enemy and put it, instead, into the hand of man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The reason God created man is that man may rule in the place of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What abounding grace we see in God's creation of man!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Not only does God desire that man should rule, but He marks out a specific area for man to rule.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We see this in Genesis 1:26: "Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth..."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"All the earth" is the domain of man's rule.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Not only did God give man dominion over the fish of the sea, the birds of the heavens, and the cattle, but He further required that man should rule over "all the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The area where God desired man to rule is the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Man is especially related to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Not only in His plan to create man was God's attention focused upon the earth, but after God made man, He clearly told him that he was to rule over the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Verses 27 and 28 say, "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it..."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What God emphasized here is that man should "replenish the earth" and "subdue it"; it is of secondary importance that man should have dominion over the fish of the sea, the fowl of the air, and every living thing on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Man's dominion over these other things is an accessory; the main subject is the earth.</S>
