<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Neck</H2><P>The adornment on the neck signifies the maiden's natural gentleness. The neck was stiff, but now there is adornment. This shows her natural gentleness. A neck that is without a necklace signifies a stubborn neck.</P><P>Verse 9 compares her to a company of horses, while verse 10 points out the reason she was compared to the horses. She is swift because of her natural strength and gentleness. Although the revelation of the chambers has resulted in a spiritual pursuit on her part, her natural swiftness, that is, her natural strength and gentleness, is still at work. Perhaps the reason for the lack of advance in many people is their natural swiftness! Verses 9 and 10 reveal that although she is beautiful, her beauty is natural. Only the beauty that comes from God is true beauty. The Lord promises to make two things for her. "We will make." This is the King's promise. The Holy Spirit reminds us of the Triune God here.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Borders of Gold</H2><P>It takes considerable time to beat gold into borders. Borders of gold signify a fine work, a most fine manifestation of God's life. The word "borders" in the original language means something that resembles a crown. It is a ring, a crown of golden borders. This word is the same word as "rows" in verse 10, which can be translated as "braidings." Hence, "borders of gold" can also be translated as "braidings of gold." Replacing the natural braidings of the hair with braidings of gold means replacing one's natural strength with God's righteousness, life, and glory. It means replacing that which is from man with that which is from God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Studs of Silver</H2><P>Silver signifies redemption. Being studded with silver means being founded upon the redemptive work of the cross.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE MAIDEN'S SPEAKING (1:12-14)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Ever-present Indwelling Christ (1:12-13)</H2><P>Verse 12 says, "While the King sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof." The Bible pays special attention to Solomon's table (1 Kings 4:22-23; 10:5). "The King sitteth at his table." This refers to the believers' enjoyment of the Lord's riches. These riches can be divided into two categories: (1) the flour and the meal, which signify the Lord Jesus' life and the Lord Himself, and (2) the meats, which refer to His work and His death. "While the King sitteth at his table" is the time of our feeding and enjoyment. Every time we come to the King's table, we are dealing with the matter of food. We are those who eat God's accepted sacrifices, that is, the work which God has accepted. (In the Old Testament, parts of the sacrifices were set aside for man's eating.)</P><P>How do we eat God's accepted sacrifices? When God sees the Lord's death, He sees a sacrifice of propitiation. When we see the Lord's death, we see not only a substitution, but a union as well. Once we see this, we will have the fragrance and praise. If we have not seen that God's accepted sacrifice is our enjoyment, we will not have consecration and praise. But when we see that we enjoy the same thing that God enjoys, the ointment of spikenard will spontaneously flow out. (We can see the outpouring of the ointment of spikenard from the story of Mary.) First the Lord gives to us; then we give back to the Lord. First there is enjoyment, and then there is consecration.</P><P>Verse 13 says, "A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts." Myrrh signifies suffering, which is the cross. When the Lord was dying, someone gave Him vinegar, which means bitterness. After the Lord's death, Nicodemus anointed the Lord's body with myrrh, which means death. Any time the word night is used in this book, it refers to a time when Solomon is absent. Spiritually, it means the time when the Lord is absent, when He is not in this world. The two breasts in the Bible refer to faith and love (1 Thes. 5:8).</P><P>Verses 12 and 13 speak of the indwelling Christ. Sitting together at the table in verse 12 surely means eating together, and the condition for being at the same table is to open the door, the inner door (Rev. 3:20-21). If a person does not open his inner door, he cannot sit at the same table with the Lord. Myrrh signifies the crucified Christ. When Christ is not with us, we have to guard ourselves with faith and love. This is the beginning of inward fellowship. After we have been brought into the chambers, after we have seen the Lord's death, and after we have truly consecrated ourselves, we begin to have an inward fellowship with Him. When we open the door of our heart, we will enjoy Him, and there will be the need for true consecration. Only then can we truly follow a suffering and crucified Christ. We follow the crucified Christ with the love and faith that are within us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Putting On the Outward Christ (1:14)</H2><P>Verse 14 says, "My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi." Camphire is henna, and it is used for fingernail dye. Jewish women carried camphire wherever they went. Engedi is the name of a place in Judea. The meaning of Engedi is "the fountain of the lamb." It is the place to which David fled, and it is a wilderness (Josh. 15:61-62; 1 Sam. 23:29). The word "vineyards" should be translated "the place of the grapes." One cannot see the vine flower in the place of the grapes; no flower is found in the place of the grapes. This place of the grapes is in the wilderness. If a flower appears in this place, it will be very conspicuous.</P><P>Verse 14 covers a wider area than verse 13. The henna flower appearing in the place of the grapes speaks of Christ's distinctiveness being manifested and accentuated. Myrrh is between the breasts and cannot be seen. Hence, it refers to the inward Christ. In this verse Christ is the outward adornment, and the maiden has put on Christ. This means that Christ is confessed and testified outwardly. Before men Christ is the henna flower; He is now being manifested through the maiden.</P>
