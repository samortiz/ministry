   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED TODAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What Christians need today is a revelation from God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They need to see God's accomplished work rather than asking Him to do some new work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For Paul the battle was in the proclamation of God's eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For the saints the battle lies in seeing this plan.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For Paul this was a matter of speaking the eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For the saints it is a matter of seeing the eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul prayed for this; He asked the Father to give to the saints in Ephesus a spirit of wisdom and revelation so that they would see that God has accomplished everything.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the special character of the book of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Everything is accomplished, whether it is the work before the foundation of the world or the work on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Suppose a brother wants to deal with his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He tries once, twice, even many times, but without success.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He repeatedly fails, and eventually he blames God in his heart for not working on him or dealing with his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, the real problem lies in this person's heart he only hopes that God will do something.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He thinks that his problems would be solved and he would overcome if only God would do something.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But verse 3 says that God has already given us every spiritual blessing in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must see this in order to receive this revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to ask ourselves why we cannot believe that God has accomplished everything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We do not need to ask for greater power from God to overcome our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We only need to ask the Lord to show us the facts that Christ accomplished on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All we have to do is to claim them by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Three days later He resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Resurrection is the pinnacle of God's work; He need not advance any further than resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need not ask God to do anything for us; the only thing we need is revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Revelation reveals God's accomplished facts.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It connects us to the past.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Revelation is not necessarily something related to the future.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many people hope that they will overcome in the future, but God wants us to see what has already been accomplished on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once we see this, we will release our praise!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The power that God operates in us who believe is the same power that raised Christ from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is too wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This power operates in us just as it operated in Christ when God raised Him from the dead!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This power enables life to enter into death and come out again.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today we do not need to seek or pray for greater power.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to see that Christ has already attained everything; He has obtained the power that transcends everything.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our power does not lie in what God is going to do, but in seeing what He has already done.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Revelation is the key to everything.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our regeneration is based on seeing God's accomplished redemption on the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In reading Ephesians we realize that man's unique need is revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must see that the power in the believers is a power that subdues Hades and that prevails over death and the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A Christian becomes weak because he does not have revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whether or not a Christian is victorious depends on whether he sees and has revelation; it has nothing to do with how much power he has.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those who have revelation spontaneously have power.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Those who do not have revelation will fail no matter how hard they struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>PRAYER AND REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Paul prayed that the believers would have revelation and that they would see.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Prayer brings in revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It shows us that we are saved, that we are liberated, that life has entered into death, and that new life has come out of death.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This resurrection life enables us to experience all that Christ has gone through and consummates in the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Praise the Lord!</S>
