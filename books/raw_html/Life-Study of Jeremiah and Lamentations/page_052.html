<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>L. Having Rejected the Word<br>of Jehovah and Having No Wisdom</H2><P>"The wise men are put to shame; / They are dismayed and are taken; / Behold, they have rejected the word of Jehovah, / And what wisdom do they have?" (v. 9). Having rejected the word of Jehovah, Israel had no wisdom.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>M. Everyone Wresting Unjust Gain</H2><P>Everyone was wresting unjust gain. From the prophet even to the priest, everyone was dealing falsely (v. 10). Both the prophets and priests had become corrupt.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>N. Provoking Jehovah to Anger<br>with Their Graven Images and with Strange Idols</H2><P>The people provoked Jehovah to anger with their graven images and with strange idols (vanities&#151;v. 19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>O. All of Them Being Adulterers<br>and an Assembly of Treacherous Men</H2><P>All of them were adulterers and an assembly of treacherous men (9:2). They bent their tongue like their bow, and falsehood, and not truth, prevailed in the land, for they proceeded from evil to evil and did not know Jehovah (v. 3). They taught their tongue to speak falsehood, and they wearied themselves committing iniquity (v. 5). Their tongue was a deadly arrow and spoke deceit (v. 8a). Each spoke peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth, but in his heart he laid an ambush for him (v. 8b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>P. All the House of Israel<br>Being Uncircumcised in Heart</H2><P>Finally, in verse 26 Jehovah says that all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart.</P><P>From the verses we have covered in this message, we have seen a vivid picture of the corruption of Israel. Israel was corrupt with God and with one another; they were corrupt in every way.</P>
