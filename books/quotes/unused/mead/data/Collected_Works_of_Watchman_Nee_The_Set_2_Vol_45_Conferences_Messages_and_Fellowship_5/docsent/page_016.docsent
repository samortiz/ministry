   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-FIVE THE INITIAL MANIFESTATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE SONS OF GOD The Record of a Talk with Newly Baptized Believers Date: November 1, 1940</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place: Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Scripture Reading: 1 John 1:6; 3:14; 5:9, 11-13; John 5:24; 17:23; Rom 8:15; 1 Pet 2:22 INTRODUCTION</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When a person is born or even after he is one or two years old, he does not know who he is and what his name is.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the amazing thing is that when he grows up, he spontaneously knows his name, who his parents are, and where he lives.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It will be a big problem if he does not know who he is or if he becomes lost in the streets and cannot tell others who his father is, where he lives, and what his name is.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When a person gets to a certain age, he knows who he is, where he came from, and who his ancestors are.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the Old Testament a man could not be recognized as a Jew unless he could name his genealogy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the New Testament Matthew 1 begins with the origin of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is very important for God's people to know their origin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If a man does not know who he is, he will get in trouble when he is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is also extremely important for a regenerated Christian to know his spiritual birth and where he came from.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every brother and sister should know that he or she is born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He has regenerated us with the word of truth through the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We do have our genealogy in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In order to be a man, you have to know who you are and what your status is.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, if the police suspect you of sedition, you must be able to prove your identity if they want to interrogate you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Simply telling them who you are will not be enough.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If they do not believe that you are telling the truth, you can show them a business card.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But even this can be questioned because you may not be the person on the card.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Similarly, if others do not believe that you are a son of God, what can you do?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Can you prove that you are a son of God?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Can you prove that you are indeed born of God?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In order to answer these questions, we need to know four points from the Epistle of 1 John.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Actually, there are more than four points, but for convenience's sake and for our present purpose, we will only mention four.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE INITIAL MANIFESTATIONS OF THE SONS OF GOD Knowing God</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First John 1:6 says: "If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness, we lie and are not practicing the truth."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This verse tells us that we should know God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Bible, when light and darkness are used as illustrations, light refers to positive things and darkness refers to negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The darkness in 1 John does not refer to conduct that is dark, but to places of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It does not refer to things that are done in darkness, but to the environment of darkness itself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When a man is in darkness, he lacks the light of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For example, if the light is turned off in this room, we will be sitting in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We will not see each others' faces, and we will not know what is happening in this room.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the same way, when we say that a man is in darkness, we mean that he is ignorant of spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It does not mean necessarily that he is committing evil or doing bad things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, it means that he is ignorant of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First John 1:5 and 7 show us that God is light and that He dwells in light.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we walk in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Yet Psalm 18:11 says, "He made darkness His hiding place."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the Old Testament God dwelt in darkness, that is, in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was a mysterious God, not a God who was known and understood by man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For example, when we switch the light off in this room, we can only guess who is in the room.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the Old Testament men could only guess about God; they could not know Him in a clear way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God was in darkness, and there was no way to tell whether He had forgiven our sins or whether He loved us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the New Testament we can know these things, because the veil of the Holy of Holies has been split and the light has shone.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If light is outside our room, and the door is open, it is impossible for light not to come in. God has revealed Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He has revealed Himself from the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is no longer hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Before I was saved, I often wondered what God was like.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Year after year I guessed what God was like.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although I did not believe in Him, I did pray: "O heaven!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It would have been better had I not been born.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You have begotten me, and now I have all kinds of questions.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There is God, and there is also myself.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But You cause me to have many inconvenient ques- tions."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This happened before I believed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I was not at all clear about God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A Western friend once asked me the difference between the Old and New Testaments.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I told him that in the Old Testament God was hidden, whereas in the New Testament God has revealed Himself in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>On Mount Sinai God was hidden, but the God in the Gospels is a touchable and knowable God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A saved person must know God and be able to tell others about God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you know me, and others ask about me, you cannot say merely that I have eyes and a mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Others have eyes and mouths as well.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You have to tell them in detail about me.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The same is true about our knowledge of God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We cannot say that we do not know anything about God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we have the life of God, we should have the ability to know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We must dwell in the light and walk in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Only then will the blood of Jesus cleanse us from every sin, and only then will we know God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We must have revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Revelation is crucial to a Christian; it enables him to know God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is the blessing brought to us by the gospel, and this is the initial function, manifestation, and evidence of a regenerated Christian.</S>
