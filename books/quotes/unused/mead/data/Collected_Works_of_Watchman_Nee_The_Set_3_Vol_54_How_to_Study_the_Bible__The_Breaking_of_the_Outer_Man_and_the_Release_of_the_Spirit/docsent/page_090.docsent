   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE PLIABLENESS AFTER THE BREAKING PLIABLENESS AND THE BREAKING OF THE WILL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God uses many ways to break our outer man, and these ways vary from person to person.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the reason the Holy Spirit directs different kinds of disciplining works to different persons.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>With some people, God deals specifically with their self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Again and again God orders environments that deal with their self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>With other people, God deals with their pride.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Again and again God orders environments that break their pride.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>With still others, God deals with their wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He tears down their trust in their kind of walk which has its source in their own wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He allows them to blunder and fail in everything they lay hold of around them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God allows them to fail again and again in order that they learn not to trust in their own wisdom, until they say, "I live not by man's wisdom but by the mercy of God."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>With some people, the Holy Spirit may order yet another kind of discipline; He may use the environment to shatter their subjectivity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many people are very opinionated.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They are full of ideas and methods.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Bible says, "I am Jehovah...is there anything too hard for me?"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Jer 32:27, Darby .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With some brothers, it seems that there is nothing too hard for them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They never find one thing which prompts them to bow down and confess their ignorance and inability.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord's Spirit has to deal with them through all kinds of environments; He has to strike again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These ones will find that in spite of their boasting about everything, they cannot accomplish anything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Things they consider to be easy turn out to be the causes of failure and embarrassment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Holy Spirit chooses to humble them through this way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Simply put, the Spirit strikes different men at different points.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Spirit also deals with everyone at different speeds.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>With some, the Lord's rod visits them in a relentless, rapid sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>With others, the Lord deals with them for a while and then gives them a period of respite.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But one thing is unchanging: He always scourges those whom He loves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should find many bruised spots among God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These are the result of the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When chastisement comes, it may hit different spots, but the goal is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whatever outward form the chastisement takes, inwardly these chastisements always wound the person himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God may choose to deal with our self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He may choose to deal with our pride, our wisdom, or our subjectivity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whatever point He touches, the result of every dealing is to make us weaker than before.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He deals with us repeatedly until our self is wounded and we are weakened.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some are touched in a particular way in their emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Others are touched in a particular way in their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whatever area a man is touched in, the end result is the breaking of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He may be hit in one area, but the breaking is always applied to the self and the will.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are all stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our will is stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our stubborn will is boosted by our mind, our proposals, our self-love, our emotion, and our wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The things that sustain our stubborn will may be different, but in every case there is a hardness of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The smiting, dealing, and breaking work of the Holy Spirit may be different, but the final and intrinsic cutting work is the same it deals with the self and strikes at the will.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, everyone who is subdued, either by revelation or by discipline, shows one characteristic pliableness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Pliableness is a mark of a broken man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Those who are broken by God are pliable before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our outward shell is hard and closed because there are many things which prop up these hard things in us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are like a house that is supported by many pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These pillars keep the house from collapsing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When God removes the pillars one by one, the house collapses.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Once the outward supporting structure is dismantled, the inward self collapses.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should not think that those who speak softly are free from any stubbornness in the will.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should not think that those who are subdued in their voice are pliable in their will.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many soft-spoken ones are very hard within.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hardness has to do with our nature, not with our voice.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many people seem to be outwardly milder than others; they appear to be not as quick and loud.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But before God they are just as stubborn, hard, selfish, and self-confident.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The supporting elements which prop up our inner structure may be different, but the inner structure is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The self, the will, is just as strong.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord has to remove these supporting elements one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He has to break them one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is the reason He deals with us once, twice, and repeatedly.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>By the grace of God, something will be knocked off of us through these repeated dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Such a severe chastisement will produce a fear in us when we try to do the same thing again.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We will know that if we do the same thing again, the Lord will smite us again.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we say the same thing again, the Lord will chastise us again.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We no longer will be so free to act.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It seems as if God has only touched something outward.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But actually, our very being has become softened; we no longer can stand in the area in which we are touched.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>At least in that particular area we will not dare to disobey the Lord or insist on our ideas anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Out of fear of the Lord's chastisement, we no longer dare to move.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We fear God, and we become mellowed in that particular area.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The more we experience God's dealing, the more pliable we will become.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The more God carries out the breaking work in us and the wider the scope of this breaking becomes, the quicker we will be mellowed.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Pliableness is a result of breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When we contact certain brothers, we can say that they are gifted, but we have the feeling that they are not yet broken.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is the condition of many people: They are gifted, but they are not broken.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Others can sense this.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>As soon as they touch these ones, they can sense the hardness in them.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Once they are broken, they become soft.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If a man is never broken, he will surely remain hard.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In whatever area a man experiences God's chastisement, he will be purged from boasting, pride, carelessness, and lawlessness in that same area.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He will fear God with respect to that area, and he will become pliable in that area.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The Bible uses many symbols for the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The Spirit is symbolized by fire as well as by water.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Fire speaks of the power of the Spirit, whereas water speaks of His purity.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In symbolizing the Spirit's nature, the dove is used.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The Spirit's nature is a dove's nature pliable, peaceful, and meek.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It is not hard.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>As the Spirit of God works His nature into us step by step, we acquire a dove's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The pliableness that comes as a result of a godly fear is a mark of the Spirit's breaking work.</S>
