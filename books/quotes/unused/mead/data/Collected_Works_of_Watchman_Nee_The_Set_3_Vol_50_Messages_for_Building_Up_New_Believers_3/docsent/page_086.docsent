   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a. Religion Being Mixed Up with Politics</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the beginning of the Reformation, many of God's people came out of Catholicism because they wanted to be freed from its fornication and idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But their reformation was fueled by political power.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In their ignorance they accepted the help of outside power.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By setting up new churches, they repeated the mistake of the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Catholicism we find a church where politics and religion are married.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In setting up their own churches, the Protestants also combined politics with religion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Church Adopting the State as Its Boundary</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If the believers who left the Roman Catholic Church had turned back to the New Testament, they would have seen that the church is God's people and that it is a society that does not derive its support from anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But their light was not strong enough.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many forces around them tried to take advantage of them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As a result, they formed the so-called state churches.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The believers in Germany formed the German state church, and all German citizens became members of this church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In England there was the Anglican Church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Anyone born in England was qualified to be baptized by an Anglican priest.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to the definition of the state church, the boundary of the church is the boundary of the state.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Not only are believers included in the church, but all the citizens of the land are qualified to be baptized in the church as well.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In name, the state church is living.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Actually, it is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is how the state churches came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A Mixture of Believers and Unbelievers</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Protestantism is characterized by a mixture of the world with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Prior to this, the mixture was universal; then it became localized country by country.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Originally, the Roman Catholic Church ruled the entire world.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then independent churches sprang up in each country, and every country had its own church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church became identified with God's people as well as those who were not His people; it became mixed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In name it is living, and yet it is dead!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the condition of Protestantantism.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>d.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Individual Spiritual Giants</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Of course, this did not stop Protestantism from producing many great men.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many truly great spiritual men who were much used by God were found in Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is why the Lord said, "But you have a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their garments, and they will walk with Me in white because they are worthy" 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the history and characteristic of Protestantantism.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the one hand, it is living and yet dead.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the other hand, it produced many great spiritual men.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Yet these men were all individuals; they were not a corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Sardis has "a few names."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There are always a few here and a few there.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the characteristic of Protestantantism.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>e. The Rise of the Independent Churches</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The history of Protestantantism began with the state churches.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Later we see the development of independent churches through the so-called dissenters those who held different opinions from the state churches .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They began to realize that many joined the state churches through their so-called "baptism," not through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A man did not become a believer through faith but through baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Believers were not produced out of faith but out of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many people were awakened to this error in the state churches.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They believed that a man becomes a child of God only after he believes in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>f.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Division through the Truths</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some of them began to pay particular attention to certain new truths that they discovered.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The state churches had no serious intention of doing anything except maintaining their state organizations; they were not serious about serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God began to raise men up, a few here or a group there.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They began to discover certain truths and condemn certain practices.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They began the so-called independent churches or dissenting churches, churches which held different opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They suffered much persecution and opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The story of John Bunyan is one example of such persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There was also the persecution of the Presbyterians in Scotland.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Puritans set sail for America because of persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Among such men were John Wesley, George Whitefield, and their groups.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God would raise up a person here or there and show him some special truths.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He would stand up to condemn certain practices and dissociate himself from these sins.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As a result, some separated themselves from the state churches.</S>
