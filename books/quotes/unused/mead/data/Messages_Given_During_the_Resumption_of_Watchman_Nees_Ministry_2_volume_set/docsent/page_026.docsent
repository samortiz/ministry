   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN OBEYING THE INNER FEELING FELLOWSHIP MEETING 3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Date:10:00 a.m., December 29, 1947</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Hong Kong</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaker:Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>OBEYING THE INNER FEELING</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Brother Shen asked: As far as the inner feeling is concerned, I realize that we should do something only when we have the peace, and we should stop when we lose the peace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Suppose we are engaged in a business.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the beginning, we did not have the peace.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Consequently, we did not proceed with it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But after two weeks, we felt peaceful again.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What then should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Walking Only according</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>to the Inner Sense of Peace</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Brother Lee answered: First John 3:19-21 tells us that a Christian should not find his heart blaming him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In your business engagement, you were held back at the beginning because you did not have the peace.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Two weeks later you had the peace again.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Your question is whether or not you should proceed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The answer lies in whether or not your heart blames you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If by going to hell you can have the peace, it is all right for you to go there.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Romans 3:17 says, "And the way of peace they have not known."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Isaiah 57:21 says that there is no peace to the wicked.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord says that peace He leaves with us John 14:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord charged his disciples to bless others with peace Luke 10:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After He healed someone, He charged that one to go in peace Mark 5:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For Christians, peace is something within.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you are seeking for outward peace, you will never be able to be a proper Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is also a very dangerous thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As Christians, we have to be those who have peace within us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the Spirit of God is not at ease within us, we will not have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Others' criticisms, attacks, praises, or debasements can all be ignored.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What we need to pay attention to is our inner feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The apostle Paul said, "Because of this I also exercise myself to always have a conscience without offense toward God and men" Acts 24:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is a person who fears God and who lives in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Not in the Letter, but in the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The only place to be a Christian is in your spirit and your conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is no other place and no other way to be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only by being in spirit and in the conscience can a person be a genuine Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To practice being a Christian according to the conscience is like shooting in archery; the first time a person may miss.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The second time, the third time, and even the tenth time he may miss also.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But eventually, he will hit the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you have a lawyer sit down and write out all the laws, you may find yourself blameless according to the laws.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But this does not mean that you are a proper Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is possible that you have done the right things, but that you as a person are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you compare yourself with the Bible, you may find yourself one hundred percent right according to it, yet in fact you as a person may still be off.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do not misunderstand me.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I am not saying that I do not agree with the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Bible says that we have to love others as we love ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you merely act according to the letter of this word, even if you were to achieve it, you would still be off.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you touch God this morning, you will feel that you have to care for others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You will not only give your coat to others; you will be willing to give even your skin to others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Outwardly speaking, this kind of caring for others appears to be the same as the kind of love mentioned earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But in reality, there is a great difference between being a Christian according to the letter and one according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Similarly, the humility spoken of in the Bible is not one which bows ninety degrees to others.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This will only make your body pliable; what you need is a pliable inner sense.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Your inner being needs to be soft.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If it is slightly hardened, you will feel uneasy.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Those Christians who behave in an outward way feel uneasy only when they lose their face.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To be sorry because of an outward mistake is worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is like a thief feeling sorry because he is caught, rather than because he has committed the crime of stealing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If a person feels sorry only because he is caught by others, this kind of sorrow is worthless.</S>
