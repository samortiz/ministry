   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Old Testament Types of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The central thought of all the prophecies is realized first in Christ and then in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Christ we see God mingled with man, and in the church we also see God mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Eve Coming Out of Adam</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first prophecy of the church is in the form of a type, which is the record of Eve in Genesis 2:21-24.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As the wife of Adam, Eve is a type of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Eve came out of Adam to be the counterpart of Adam, to match Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is a type of the church, showing us how the church comes into existence and what the function of the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This type is fulfilled in Ephesians 5:31-32.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Many Brothers of the Firstborn</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A second great prophecy of the church is in Psalm 22:22.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This verse, speaking of the resurrection of Christ, says, "I will declare Your name to my brothers;/In the midst of the assembly I will praise You."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The fulfillment of this type is in John 20 and Hebrews 2.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>John 20:17 says that after His resurrection, the Lord Jesus called His disciples "My brothers," and Hebrews 2:12 tells us that these brothers are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church is a composition, the assembly, of the many brothers of Christ the firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Children of the Father</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A third major Old Testament prophecy of the church is that of the children of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is found in Isaiah 8:18, which says, "See, I and the children whom Jehovah has given me."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this verse the "I" is Christ, and the children are the members of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This prophecy is fulfilled in Hebrews 2:13.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The above are the main prophecies of the church found in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In summary, the church is the same to Christ as Eve was to Adam; that is, the church comes out of Christ to match Christ and be one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church is also the many brothers of the Firstborn having the same life and nature as Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ is the Firstborn, and the church is composed of His many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Third, the church comprises the children whom the Father gave to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church issues from Christ as life because all of the members of the church are born of Christ, who is the very source of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The above prophecies emphasize that Christ is the mingling of God with man, and the church is the counterpart of Christ, the many brothers with Christ the Firstborn, and the children given to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These three prophecies clearly show us that the church is a part of Christ, born of Christ to match Him, and one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the central thought of the prophecies in the Old Testament concerning Christ and the church and their fulfillment in the New Testament.</S>
