   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Seven Lamps Signifying the Spirit as the Expression</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Exodus 25:37 says, "Thou shalt make its lamps, seven.''</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These seven lamps signify God the Spirit being the seven Spirits of God for His expression Rev 4:5; 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The shining of the lamps denotes expression.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Substantially the lampstand is one, but expressively it is seven, because it is one lampstand with seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In substance the lampstand is one piece of gold, but it holds seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This indicates that, mysteriously, in substance the Triune God is one but in expression He is the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Father as the substance is embodied in the Son as the form, and the Son is expressed as the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We can prove from the Scriptures that the seven lamps of the golden lampstand signify the Spirit expressing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we had only the record in Exodus, it would be difficult to realize that these seven lamps are the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But as we proceed from Exodus to Zechariah, we see that the seven lamps are the seven eyes of Christ, the seven eyes of Jehovah Zech 3:9; 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As we continue to Revelation, we see that the seven eyes of the Lamb are the seven eyes which are the intensified Spirit of God Rev 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, we have a strong basis for saying that the seven lamps are the seven Spirits, that is, the sevenfold intensified Spirit, as the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, the seven lamps are the expression of God the Son as the embodiment of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The gold signifies the Father as the substance, the stand signifies the Son as the embodiment of the Father, and the lamps signify the Spirit as the expression of the Father in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, the significance of the Triune God is implied in the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE GOLDEN LAMPSTAND SIGNIFYING ISRAEL AS GOD'S TESTIMONY IN THE OLD TESTAMENT AND IN THE MILLENNIUM</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The lampstand is first mentioned in Exodus 25.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Near the end of the Old Testament, the lampstand is mentioned again in Zechariah 4:2.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"What seest thou?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>And I said, I have looked, and behold a lampstand all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof'' Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Here the lampstand signifies Israel as God's testimony in the Old Testament and in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Old Testament times, whenever the nation of Israel was in a normal condition, it was God's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the coming millennium, the restored nation of Israel will once again be God's testimony symbolized by a golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Exodus 25 we only have the lampstand with the seven lamps; there is no mention of what the seven lamps refer to.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Zechariah, however, we are given a definite interpretation of the seven lamps, for in this book we are told that the seven lamps are the seven eyes of Jehovah 4:10 and the seven eyes of the stone 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A. Shining through the Seven Eyes Spirits of Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Zechariah we have the seven eyes and the seven lamps but not the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But in Revelation the seven lamps are developed into the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"Out of the throne come forth lightening and voices and thunders; and seven lamps of fire are burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God'' Rev 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here we have a new and further development of the seven lamps as the seven Spirits, for we are told clearly that the seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Since the seven lamps are the seven eyes and also the seven Spirits, then the seven eyes in Zechariah 4:10 are the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This gives us the ground to say that the lampstand in Zechariah 4 shines through the seven eyes, the seven Spirits, of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>B. As the Seven Eyes of Christ the Stone-Savior for God's Building</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The seven eyes, the seven Spirits, of Jehovah are the seven eyes of Christ, who is the Stone-Savior for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Zechariah 3:9 says, "For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.''</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The reference to engraving the stone indicates that this stone is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord Jesus as the building stone, was engraved, dealt with, by God on the cross for the iniquity of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In one day, by that engraving on the cross, the Lord Jesus took away all the sins of God's people John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, the stone with the seven eyes is Christ, the Stone-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We know that Christ is the Stone-Savior by the fact that the seven eyes of the stone in Zechariah 3:9 become the seven eyes of the Lamb in Revelation 5:6.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as having been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.''</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lamb here has seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Revelation 4:5 the seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God, and in 5:6 the seven eyes of the Lamb are the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Here we have a further development over Zechariah, for the seven eyes are not only the seven eyes of the stone but also the seven eyes of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These seven eyes of the Lamb are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is a reference to Zechariah 4:10, where we are told that the seven eyes of Jehovah run to and fro through the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Zechariah 3 and 4 we have the seven eyes of the stone, the seven lamps of the lampstand, and the seven eyes of Jehovah, all of which are the seven Spirits of God.</S>
