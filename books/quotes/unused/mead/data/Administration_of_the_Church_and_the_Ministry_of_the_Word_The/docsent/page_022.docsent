   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BUILDING BEING GOD S UNIQUE GOAL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We should not think that after God has saved all of us sinners and has finished building mansions for us in heaven, He will come and take us to live in these mansions.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God has only one building work in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this work sinners are saved to become building materials that are then mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The element of heaven is also in this mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is God s building, where God takes man as His dwelling place and man takes God as his abode.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a mysterious abode; it is the city which has the foundations, whose Architect and Builder is God Heb 11:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the universe God has only this one work, this one building.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this building God is mingled with man, and heaven is joined to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The entire Bible shows the building work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The completion of this building is the manifestation of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The New Jerusalem is God in man, that is, God taking man as His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is also man in God, that is, man taking God as his abode.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Ultimately, God and man, man and God, are mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God brings heaven into the New Jerusalem; the condition and element of heaven are in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, the New Jerusalem is not only expressed on earth but also joined to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God and man are mingled together; heaven and earth are joined together.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Man takes God as his dwelling place, and God takes man as His abode.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the building of God in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even though this can be called a place because heaven is included and is expressed on earth, it is a person because God is in man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is what God is building today; it is a city which has the foundations, whose Architect and Builder is God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This building is the place the Lord is preparing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, Revelation 21:2 uses the word prepared: New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The goal of God s work is the building.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He saves sinners and edifies the saints for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The New Jerusalem is composed of all the saved believers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to Revelation 21, the city has a wall and twelve gates.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel are inscribed on the gates, and the wall has twelve foundations with the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb vv.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>12-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God is not building a dwelling place with the intention of taking us there when it is complete.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is not according to the revelation in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are the house, the dwelling place, that God is building.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are God s temple, the dwelling place of God through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As living stones, we are being built up as a spiritual house 1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In its completion the temple will be enlarged to become the city.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, there is no temple in the city Rev 21:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The city is the enlargement of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God s work today is to build a dwelling place for Himself in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, in speaking of the city, verse 3 says that the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will tabernacle with them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Saving sinners and edifying the saints are not God s goal.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He saves sinners and edifies the saints in order to gain a building on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God s building is a corporate man, not an individual person.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>John 14 shows what God is doing in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Saving sinners and edifying the saints are only part of God s work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is doing a building work.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God wants to prepare a dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This dwelling place is a mysterious entity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is God mingling Himself with man and working man into Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This building also includes the element of heaven; heaven is joined to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, it is the mingling of God and man and the joining of heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the work which God is doing today.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we understand this point as we read the New Testament, we will receive much light and will apprehend the meaning of the New Jerusalem and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We will also understand our goal and purpose in the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are not here simply to save sinners and edify the saints; rather, our goal is God s building, His dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God is doing a building work.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Gospel of John, Acts, and the Epistles show the stones for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Acts 4:11 says that Christ is the cornerstone; Ephesians 2:22 says that we are being built together in Him into a dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In 1 Corinthians 3, Paul says that we are God s building v. 9 and that we should take heed how we build v. 10 . If anyone builds upon the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble, the work of each will become manifest vv.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>12-13 .</S>

   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God is designing and building a city.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>According to verse 40, the Old Testament saints need the New Testament believers in order to receive God s promise.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Although Abraham was built by God, many in the New Testament age have not been built; hence, the city has not been manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, the city will be manifested, prepared, and built by the end of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Revelation 21:3 clearly says that the New Jerusalem is God tabernacling with men.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is filled with the element of heaven, and it is expressed on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is the joining of heaven and earth, the mingling of man and God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is not the blessing of individual spiritual believers.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God s temple becomes a city, God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is what God wants and what He is doing.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is God s goal, His central work.</S>
