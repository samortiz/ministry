<h1 class="title">EATING, DRINKING,<br />
AND ENJOYING THE LORD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 6:54-57; Matt. 26:26-28; 1 Cor. 10:3-4; Matt. 4:4; Jer. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:2; Isa. 12:3-4; Rom. 10:12</h1>
<h2 class="head1">SALVATION BEING<br />
TO EAT, DRINK, AND ENJOY THE LORD</h2>
<p>Salvation is God entering into us to be our life. It is marvelous that we can experience Him by allowing Him to fill us and to make home in us, that is, to occupy every part of our being. In our experience this is also something normal that does not require us to exert any effort or to do something. Salvation is high and mysterious because God has accomplished everything so that He can work Himself into us to be our life, our living, and our person. This is the highest revelation in the New Testament. Salvation is different from and higher than religion and philosophy, including the ethical teachings of Confucius.</p>
<p>God has also become our enjoyment. He is our food and drink so that we can eat and drink Him. To say that we can eat and drink God may sound offensive and seem to be wild, but it is the revelation in the Bible.</p>
<p>God first created the heavens and the earth. Then He created man in His own image and formed a spirit within man in order for man to receive Him. The New Testament says, &ldquo;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness&rdquo; (John 4:24). Only the human spirit can touch and receive the divine Spirit. Only our human spirit is capable of worshipping the Spirit of God. Worshipping the Spirit is the inclination and obligation of our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING THE LORD</h2>
<p>After creating man, God did not give him numerous messages or commandments. Rather, God placed man in front of the tree of life and charged him not to be careless concerning his eating. In other words, it was not a matter of man&rsquo;s conduct but of what he ate. The first thing in the Bible concerning man is the matter of eating. Whether man would be acceptable or unacceptable depended on what he ate.</p>
<p>To eat is to receive, that is, to take in food that is outside of us so that it becomes our life essence. The food that we eat is digested and then assimilated into the cells of our body and even becomes the constituents of our cells, our very substance. Chinese children who live in China are usually short, thin, and pale, but if they go to the United States, in just five years they will grow tall, become husky, and look healthy. This difference is caused by their eating. American food is rich in nutrients; thus, those who eat American food grow up looking like Americans. While an American brother was living in Taipei, his child became yellowish in complexion. One day I asked the brother why his child&rsquo;s complexion was yellowish, and the brother said that his child had been eating too many carrots. This shows that we look like what we eat, or in other words, we are what we eat.</p>
<p>I grew up in a Christian home and often contacted American pastors. One day I asked my mother why the American pastors smelled like cows. She replied, &ldquo;They eat beef every day, so they smell like cows.&rdquo; My maternal grandfather lived near the sea, and his home smelled of fish. When I asked my mother about this, she said, &ldquo;They eat fish every day, so they have the smell of fish.&rdquo; We are what we eat.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being the Believers&rsquo; Food</h2>
<p>We need to ask ourselves, &ldquo;What are we eating?&rdquo; I am not referring to the physical food that nourishes our body; I am referring to spiritual food. To believe in the Lord Jesus is different from believing in a religion. Religion teaches people to devoutly worship God, but to believe in the Lord Jesus is to eat Christ in our spirit. The expression <em>eating Christ</em> does not sound nice, but in the Scriptures the Lord Jesus compared Himself to different kinds of food. In John 1:29 He is spoken of as the Lamb of God. In chapter 6 He is the bread of life (vv. 35, 48, 51), and in verse 57 He said that those who eat Him will live because of Him. The words <em>because of</em> can also be rendered as &ldquo;through&rdquo; or &ldquo;by.&rdquo; The Lord is the bread of life, and those who eat Him will live through Him and by Him. The Lord&rsquo;s comparison of Himself to the bread of life indicates that we need to eat Him in order to be nourished by Him. No matter how much we may appreciate or praise the bread of life, it has nothing to do with us if we do not eat it. However, if instead of appreciating and praising we would take a few bites, we would receive nourishment. Bread is not for appreciation; it is for eating.</p>
<p>The expression <em>eating Christ</em> may sound rather wild, but the Lord Jesus came to be our bread. He is the bread of life to be the strength for our living and walk; hence, He is not for us to appreciate but for us to receive by eating. The breakfast that I ate this morning gives me the strength to speak. Without such a rich and nutritious breakfast, I would not have the strength to release this message. A car needs to &ldquo;eat&rdquo; gas in order to run; a car cannot run without gas.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the bread of life, and those who eat Him will live by Him. The bread of life should be made from wheat; however, the Lord says that this bread is His flesh: &ldquo;My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink. He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me and I in him&rdquo; (vv. 55-56). It is a mystery that bread, which is of the vegetable life, can be flesh as well. This shows that it is not easy to understand the Lord.</p>
