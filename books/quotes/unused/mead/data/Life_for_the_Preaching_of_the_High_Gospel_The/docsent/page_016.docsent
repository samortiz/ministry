   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I believe the Lord is going to move in a fast way.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When the day of Pentecost came, three thousand were saved on that one day Acts 2:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On another day five thousand were saved 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If one day in Southern California, ten thousand people, especially the young people, would turn to the Lord's dominion, it would not be a surprise to me.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this country today a great number of young people are rebellious toward the old way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Of course, this is not good for the families, the society, and the country.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the Lord is sovereign.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All the nations are under Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The United States was and still is a Christian country.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But look at the situation today.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If the young people of this generation were still stuck to the old way of living, it would be rather hard for them to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But today thousands of young people, many of whom are hippies, have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They forget about the world and give up the old way of living.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We do believe that the Lord will turn a great number of hippies unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How can you bring them in?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do you bring them into the cathedrals, into the so-called church buildings?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Go to meet with them on the beaches.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If two or three hundred of the young saints have the feeling and the burden to go to the beach to meet, they should do it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You can bring with you the public-address system and broadcast the good news to everyone, asking them to come and join you in the church in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can never confine the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today the situation of Christianity is exactly the same as that in the ancient days of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>My burden is to share with you that today the Lord Jesus is going to do a new thing with a new generation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Apparently, Anna and Simeon were not in that move, but they were absolutely for that move and they prayed very much for it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I believe many elderly ones who are for the Lord are in the same position as Anna and Simeon.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You have to pray night and day for the Lord's new move.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yet for the move itself, the Lord will use mostly the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the Lord was on earth, He used the fishermen and the menders, the Galileans.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He used those who were not in the temple, but in the boats on the sea, and He used those who were willing to jump into the water.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord Jesus came to the disciples, walking on the sea, and said to Peter, "Come."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That means Peter had to jump into the water, and he did it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Suppose Peter would have said, "No, Lord, I won't jump into the water.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Why can't I stay in the boat?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To be in the boat is safe.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is the logical thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Sooner or later I will come to You.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You just wait awhile."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then he would have become a materialistic person, who was so rational, logical, and sound that he would not jump into the water but would stay in the boat and come to the Lord gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord Jesus exercised much training with Peter to bring him out of the religious and materialistic concept and into the dominion of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You should learn a lesson from Peter's experience.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whatever the Lord says, do it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whatever the Lord says, take it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whatever the Lord says, stand on it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You do not need to exercise any reasoning.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You do not need to be religious or spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You need to be under God's dominion.</S>
