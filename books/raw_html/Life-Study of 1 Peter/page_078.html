<h2 class="head1">THE APPEAL OF A GOOD CONSCIENCE</h2><p>The Greek word rendered &ldquo;appeal&rdquo; is <i>eperotema,</i> a question, an inquiry. Its meaning is very much disputed. The right meaning of the phrase seems to be, as Alford said, &ldquo;the seeking after God of a good and pure conscience,&rdquo; which governs the proper Christian life. This kind of question, asking for something, may be considered an appeal or demand. Peter&rsquo;s thought here may be that baptism is the appeal to God of the baptized one for a good conscience unto God. Baptism, as a symbol, a counterpart of our belief in all the accomplishments of Christ, testifies that all the problems we have before God and with God have been solved. Hence, it is also a testimony, witnessing that in our conscience there is no more offense, but rather we are full of peace and confidence that we have been baptized into the Triune God (Matt. 28:19) and organically united with Him through the resurrection of Christ, that is, by Christ in resurrection as the Spirit of life. Without the Spirit of Christ as its reality, baptism by water immediately becomes an empty and dead ritual.</p><p>In this verse we see that baptism is first our appeal, the appeal of the baptized ones, to God for a conscience that is both good and pure. A proper baptism will always bring the baptized one into such a situation. Before we believed in the Lord and were baptized, we were sinners. But when we were enlightened through the preaching of the gospel, we came to realize that we are very sinful. Both before God and toward man we have had many transgressions, trespasses, and offenses, and we had a great deal of guilt. Then we repented, believed in the Lord, received His forgiveness, and were saved. But our repentance and believing need an outward expression. This expression is baptism. Therefore, baptism and our believing, our faith, are two aspects of one thing. For this reason the New Testament speaks of believing and being baptized (Mark 16:16). Believing and being baptized can be compared to using our two feet to take a single step. First we believe, and our believing can be compared to the half-step forward of one foot. Then we are baptized. Our baptism can be compared to the completion of the step with the other foot. Together, believing and baptism make one complete step.</p><p>As we have pointed out elsewhere, believing is our reflection of all that Christ has accomplished. First, what Christ has accomplished for our salvation is preached to us as the gospel. As we listen to this preaching, the Spirit works upon us and within us to cause us to reflect what we have heard in the gospel, a reflection of what we have heard regarding Christ&rsquo;s accomplishment.</p><p>This experience of reflecting Christ&rsquo;s accomplishment can be compared to taking a picture with a camera. A camera is focused on a certain scene, and then a reflection of the scene is impressed on the film. We may compare Christ&rsquo;s accomplishments to a scene to be photographed with a camera. The proper preaching of the gospel brings the view of this &ldquo;scenery&rdquo; into us, and the Holy Spirit enlightens us. Then the scenery is imprinted on the &ldquo;film&rdquo; of our spirit. The result is that, from within, we believe in Christ. Therefore, in our being there is a reflection of Christ&rsquo;s accomplishments, and this reflection is our believing in Christ.</p><p>We have pointed out that believing in Christ requires an expression, and that this expression is baptism. Baptism, therefore, is the counterpart to our believing in Christ.</p><p>Furthermore, when we are baptized, we, as baptized ones, appeal to God for a good and pure conscience. After we have been baptized and rise up out of the water, we have a conscience that is good and pure, a conscience without condemnation. All our sins, offenses, transgressions, and trespasses have been forgiven, and all the problems that have entangled our life and our being have been buried in the water. This means that through baptism we have a clearance of our sinful past. Because of this clearance, we can have a good and pure conscience.</p><p>We would emphasize the fact that baptism itself does not put away the filth of the flesh. But baptism does enable us to have the assurance and the testimony that we appeal to God for a good and pure conscience. Then, after we are baptized, God answers us by indicating that we now have a conscience that is good and pure.</p>
