        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE FUNCTION OF GOD AS LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 14:16-17; 16:12-15; Rom. 8:2, 9; 1 John 2:27</h1>
<p>John 16:13 and 14 say, &ldquo;When He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are coming. He will glorify Me, for He will receive of Mine and will declare it to you.&rdquo; Verse 15 says, &ldquo;All that the Father has is Mine; for this reason I have said that He receives of Mine and will declare it to you.&rdquo; There are references to four persons in verse 15. The first reference is to the Father, the second reference is to the Lord, the third reference is to the Spirit, and the fourth reference is to the believers. <em>All that the Father has</em> refers to the Father. <em>Is Mine</em> refers to the Lord. <em>He receives of Mine</em> refers to the Spirit, who receives from the Lord. <em>Will declare it to you</em> refers to the believers, who receive the Spirit&rsquo;s declaration. These words are very simple, but they speak of the crucial matter of the Triune God coming into the believers. The process of the Triune God coming into the believers begins with the Father and all that He has. All that the Father is and has, all His fullness, is in the Lord and is the Lord&rsquo;s (Col. 1:19). The Spirit receives the fullness of the Father from the Lord. The fullness of the Father is embodied in the Son and declared by the Spirit to the believers. The Spirit declares the fullness of the Father that is in the Son to the believers, making known to the believers all that He has received from the Son. This is the process of the Triune God coming into the believers.</p>
<p>The Triune God is the Spirit and the Word (John 4:24; 1:1). After the Lord Jesus died and resurrected, He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). The Spirit is omnipresent; He is everywhere. Hence, man can contact Him at any time and in any place. The Word is concrete. The Bible is a book that is in our hands, and the words of the Bible are often spoken to us. Hence, we can read the Bible with our eyes and hear its words with our ears. Whether we read or hear the words of the Bible, we should not contact them merely with our eyes or our ears; we should use our spirit so that the Word can enter into us as the Spirit. Hence, the Word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is conveyed in the Word. The Spirit and the Word are one. When the Spirit or the Word enters into us, they become life in us (John 6:63).</p>
<p>No person can say that he cannot touch God, because God has come forth. In order to come forth, He first became flesh (1:14), and then He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). His becoming flesh was His coming forth out of heaven, and His becoming the Spirit is for His entering into redeemed humanity. God the Spirit is omnipresent. Hence, no matter where a person is, as long as he is willing to use his spirit to contact God, he will touch God. The place where we can touch God is our human spirit. Hence, we must see the two spirits&mdash;the Spirit of God and the human spirit. God is Spirit. He became flesh, passed through death and resurrection, and became the life-giving Spirit. Not only so, God created man with a human spirit so that man would be a vessel to receive Him. Our created human spirit is the organ for us to receive God the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD CREATING THE HUMAN SPIRIT<br />
FOR MAN TO RECEIVE HIM</h2>
<p>God created us with many organs so that we might receive the many things that are outside of us. For example, God wanted us to receive food and water, so He created us with a stomach. If we did not have a stomach, we would not be able to receive food and water. God wanted us to receive sound, so He created us with ears. Without ears, you would not be able to receive what I am saying. Similarly, in order for us to receive God, He created us with a human spirit. God is Spirit, and only the human spirit can touch, contact, and receive the Spirit. God created us with a human spirit so that we could receive Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Function of the Human Spirit</h2>
<p>We know what our eyes and our ears are, and although our stomach is not visible, we still know what it is. However, we might not know what our spirit is or where it is located. Many people have been saved for years, but they do not know that they have a human spirit. Some might know about their spirit doctrinally but not know how to experience their spirit. In the beginning God created man with a spirit. This spirit is not for us to receive food or sound; it is for us to receive God. If a person does not contact God or have any dealings with Him, his spirit is &ldquo;unemployed&rdquo;; that is, it has no function. This is the condition of many believers who do not use their spirit. They use their eyes, ears, lips, and brain, but they do not use their spirit; their spirit has been &ldquo;laid off.&rdquo; The more we use an organ, the stronger it becomes, but an organ that we do not use will gradually wither. If a person covered his eyes so that he could not see any light, his eyes would lose their function after several years. Similarly, many believers cannot manifest their function, because they do not use their spirit.</p>
<p>When we heard the gospel, the Spirit came to touch our spirit. He first opened our mind to understand the truth of the gospel, and then He touched our heart. Our heart is closely related to our spirit; therefore, when the Holy Spirit touched our heart, He also touched our spirit. When we believed, our spirit was enlivened before God. As a result, genuine repentance and confession came from our spirit. The first time we repented and confessed before God, that repentance and confession came from the deepest part of our being. Hence, our spirit is the deepest part of our being.</p>
<p>Sometimes we have ample reasons to do something, because we have considered it with our mind. However, even though our mind agrees, we can have a feeling within that bothers us, that questions what we are doing. This shows that our intellect is one thing, but our spirit is another thing. We all have had this experience. Sometimes our spirit condemns us, saying that we are not proper. Although we may be able to defend ourselves with many reasons, in the deepest part of our being there is a sense or a feeling that we are not right. As we justify our actions, the sense within does not match. Thus, we discover that there are two persons in us. There is a person, our self, that likes to reason, and there is another person related to our human spirit.</p>
<p>The Chinese associate this second person with the conscience. Some people like to declare that they always speak according to their conscience. If they are asked how much money they spent on a certain item, they may say that they spent thirty dollars, but in their deepest part they know that this is false. If they respond to this sense, they will correct their speaking, saying, &ldquo;I must speak according to my conscience. I actually spent only twenty dollars.&rdquo; The conscience is a part of the human spirit (Rom. 8:16; 9:1). The function of the conscience is the best proof that man has a spirit. The human spirit is the deepest part of man and is his most upright part. Most of the time our conscience does not stand on our side by excusing us; rather, it stands against us by accusing us (2:15).</p>
<p>Sometimes a person would argue with me and give many reasons to justify himself. Instead of arguing, I say to him, &ldquo;Dear friend, you do not need me to say anything to you. Your deepest part has spoken to you on my behalf. You are arguing with me outwardly, but your inner being has already refuted you. I do not need to say anything. Moreover, the less I say, the clearer the speaking is in you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such examples show that there is a spirit in man. This spirit is the organ with which we receive God. If our heart is open to God, whenever our spirit moves, the Spirit will touch our spirit.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
