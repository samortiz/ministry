   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE KINGDOM,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>COMING OUT OF THE LORD,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>BEING UNSHAKABLE A. We Having Repented for the Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The gospel which the New Testament has preached to us is the gospel of the kingdom Matt 3:1-2; 4:17, 23; 10:7; 24:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We repented for the kingdom Matt 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Perhaps when we were saved, we did not hear such a clear gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At that time, we were afraid of going to hell and desired to go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, we repented for heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the preaching of the wrong gospel, for repentance is not for heaven but for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>B. We Having Been Reborn into the Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have been reborn, regenerated, into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In John 3:5 the Lord Jesus said, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God Recovery Version .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many of us were wrongly told that regeneration is for going to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here we see clearly that regeneration is for entering into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>C. We Having Been Translated into the Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Colossians 1:13 says, Who hath delivered us from the authority of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of the son of his love Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>. This verse reveals that we have been translated out of one kingdom, Satan s kingdom of darkness, into another kingdom, the kingdom of the Son of God s love.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>D. The Church Life</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Being the Kingdom of God Today</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the church, we are living in the kingdom of God today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Romans 14:17 is a strong proof that today s church life is the kingdom: The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit Recovery Version .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Revelation 1:9 also proves that we are in the kingdom of God today: I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When John wrote the book of Revelation, he was already in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These two verses are a strong proof that the church today is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, as we shall see, what we are in now in the church today is the kingdom in its reality, whereas the kingdom in its manifestation will come with Christ s return in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>V. THE REALITY AND MANIFESTATION</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>OF THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we would understand the New Testament truths regarding the kingdom, we must realize the two main aspects of the kingdom the aspect of its reality and the aspect of its manifestation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the church today, we do not have the kingdom in manifestation; we have the kingdom in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to the outward appearance, men cannot see the kingdom in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nevertheless, the kingdom is a reality among us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A. The Reality of the Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Being an Exercise and Discipline</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>in the Church Today</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The reality of the kingdom, the kingdom in its reality, is an exercise and discipline for us in the church today Matt 5:3, 10, 20; 7:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Suppose you purchase a hamburger at a stand and the cashier gives you too much change.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you are exercised and are ruled by the kingdom, you will return this extra change immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is an experience of the rule of the reality of the kingdom, which is both an exercise and a discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The situation of today s Christianity is very poor, for many Christians have been drugged, thinking that everything is of grace and that there is no need for training, exercise, or discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But we realize that we must uplift the standard of the church life through the discipline and exercise of the reality of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Through the years, I have seen the Lord s grace working in so many of us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I thank the Lord that there has been a great improvement in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Nevertheless, we must uplift the standard even higher.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we do this, our cheering angels will be very happy, for they will see a group of believers who are quite serious regarding God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How we need the discipline for the kingdom today!</S>
