James is on Christian perfection, but is this perfection by the old man or by the new man, by the natural man or by the regenerated man?
According to history and according to James's writing, there are different perfections on different levels in different ages
Job's perfection is before the law, without law; Saul's perfection is under the law; and James's perfection is under both the law and grace
The Christian perfection stressed by James was under both the law and grace, by both the old, natural man and the new, regenerated man
The crown of life is an incentive, inciting the believers to count all the trials as a kind of joy, so that they can endure them by faith
These three points are very good: the begetting of God, the word of truth, and the firstfruits of His creatures
When Christ comes back, He will judge us not according to Moses' law, the law of letters, but according to the new law, the law of life
Now we want to see the seven factors of which the Christian perfection stressed by James is brought forth, or produced
The seventh and final factor of which the Christian perfection stressed by James is produced is the grace given by God
Faith is one of the means of Christian perfection stressed by James , but in the entire New Testament the means is much higher than this
James speaks of the wisdom given by God, not to know how to fulfill God's eternal economy but to know how to be perfect
He did not speak of a high wisdom according to God's New Testament economy but of a low wisdom according to perfection in behavior
According to the context, the royal law and the law of freedom, also referred to in 1:25, both refer to the law of letters
The Old Testament psalmists believed that if you meditated on the law of God and treasured it, you would not sin
God's judgments were a means spoken of by James to carry out perfection because the judgment of God warns people
James 39 says that with our tongue we bless the Lord and Father and with it we curse men who have been made according to the likeness of God
James 5:8 says, 'You also be long-suffering; establish your hearts because the coming of the Lord has drawn near'
The virtues of his perfection are not produced by God as our supply but are produced by the cultivation of the natural 'bright virtue'
He knew only how to be pious, how to be godly, how to fear God, how to behave righteously, how to be perfect, and how to be upright
In this message we want to see the genuine Christian perfection revealed in the entire divine revelation of the New Testament
He was God conceived in the womb of a virgin for nine months and born out of her to be a man, and that man was called Emmanuel, God with us
The union and mingling of the believers with the Triune God is the fifth means of the genuine Christian perfection
The Lord Jesus in the New Testament teaches us that to follow Him, we have to deny ourselves and bear the cross
Making the church the fullness of both God and Christ as Their expression is another function of the genuine Christian perfection
The new creation is composed only of God's redeemed, who are reconstituted, remade, with God Himself as the element
Galatians 6:15 says, 'For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is what matters'
We are God's new creation, and the aggregate, the totality, of all God's redeemed people as the new creation is the New Jerusalem
All of God's redeemed, probably from Adam, the latest from Abel, have been participating in the consummation of the New Jerusalem
We have seen that James made the great mistake of uplifting the Old Testament law of letters but his mistake is covered by a beautiful cloak
James treasured the law of letters through Moses, and he seemingly mentioned another law which he called the perfect law of freedom
Jeremiah prophesied concerning the law of life which would be written in our hearts , and Paul spoke of the law of the Spirit of life
James 28 says If indeed you are fulfilling the royal law according to the Scripture You shall love your neighbor as yourself you do well
When James spoke of the royal law, he was speaking of only one commandment of the Mosaic law, that is, to love our neighbors
Psalm 19:7 and 8 say, 'The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple
Psalm 1 says that the one who meditates in the law day and night will be like a tree growing by a flowing river
Peter said that God regenerated us with an incorruptible seed, and this incorruptible seed is the living and abiding word of God
The law, the royal law, the perfect law of freedom, the word of truth, and the implanted word refer to the same Mosaic law
After he had written Galatians, Paul went to Jerusalem where James had become a high authority, just because of the human concept
When Paul came to Jerusalem James advised him to do something to keep the law in order to appease the Jewish believers and Paul was ensnared
In a later message we will see more concerning the purpose of God in having James as a book of His holy Scriptures
The purpose of God is just to expose James; however, throughout the centuries most of the readers of the Bible approve James
The whole Scripture was written under the inspiration of the Spirit of God, but not every word in the Bible is the word of God
The word itself may not be the word of God, but it was recorded by some writer under the inspiration of the Spirit of God
It is for freedom that Christ has set us free; stand fast therefore, and do not be entangled with a yoke of slavery again
You have been brought to nought, separated from Christ, you who are being justified by law; you have fallen from grace
Paul shows us that the yoke of slavery is the bondage of the law, which makes the lawkeepers slaves under a binding yoke
We need to stand fast in the freedom from the slavery of the law, not deviating from Christ, not falling from grace
It is for fulfilling God's New Testament economy so that ultimately the New Jerusalem may be consummated to be God's enlargement
The unlimited Triune God is constituted into His redeemed by being united and mingled together with them as one entity
James did not say anything about the fulfilling of God's New Testament economy to consummate the New Jerusalem
James does not say a word concerning the cross of Christ, but the New Testament teaching strongly emphasizes the cross of Christ
The Body of Christ is the real embodiment of the Triune God in Christ as the Spirit, and this Body will consummate in the New Jerusalem
Peter also speaks of godliness, saying that the divine power has granted us all things concerning life and godliness
The real godliness issues in the Body of Christ which will consummate in the New Jerusalem for the fulfillment of Gods New Testament economy
James pointed out to Paul in Acts 21 that there were thousands of Jewish believers who were zealous for the law
70, just a short time after Paul's martyrdom, and was a fulfillment of the Lord's prophecy that Jerusalem with the temple would be destroyed
If this had not happened, the mixture of Judaism with God's New Testament economy might have continued for centuries
Job also was perfect in his way, but God stripped Job of what he was so that he could be rebuilt with God Himself
In Revelation we see the sevenfold intensified Spirit for the believers to overcome all the negative things in the degradation of the church
Hades is divided into two sections: the section of torment for the perished unbelievers, and the pleasant section called Paradise
When the Lord comes back, they will be resurrected from Paradise and from the earth with a body, soul, and spirit
It is hard to discern how much the Christian perfection stressed by James implies these all-inclusive items in the New Testament
The goal of God's New Testament economy is the Body of Christ , at which the Christian living, Christian perfection, should be aimed
The Lord Jesus told us that He has come that we may have life and may have it abundantly and that He is life to us
James referred to the regeneration by God, but only said that this rebirth was by the word of truth which is a term adopted from the Psalms
God's salvation commences with His life through regeneration and consummates in the divine life through transformation
They feel that we merely need to save sinners so that they can be justified and eventually qualified to go to heaven
God's divine power has granted to us all things which relate to life concerning life within and godliness in our living without
God's grace in Christ enables us to reign in life, ruling over all the negative things that are against God and His economy
James spoke merely of being able to resist temptation, but the life presented in the New Testament enables us to reign over sin and Satan
The Triune God flows as a river of water of life in which the tree of life grows for the supply to the entire city of the New Jerusalem
In addition to its lack in the above six items, the Epistle of James does not tell us about the following items
It is hard to discern how much the Christian perfection stressed by James implies these all-inclusive items in the New Testament
The goal of God's New Testament economy is the Body of Christ , at which the Christian living, Christian perfection, should be aimed
No philosophy, regardless of how good or high it is, can produce the Body of Christ as the complement to Christ
James's teaching is a kind of medicine that heals you to some extent in some sense, but the side effects are greater
For God to carry out His economy as a whole in the Old Testament and the New Testament, He needs four dispensations
He said that we have been brought forth, or born, of God by the word of truth, the law, from the Old Testament
He also said that the Spirit of God indwells us , but the Spirit's indwelling was not the way God dealt with His people in the Old Testament
The Lord Jesus told His Jewish disciples that the kingdom of God would be taken from the Jews and given to the church
According to God's economy in His New Testament dispensation, the church is separate from the Jews and also from the Gentiles
In 1 Corinthians 1032 Paul spoke of the Jews the Greeks and the church of God showing that there are three kinds of people today on earth
He carried out this vow to such an extent, but God would not tolerate his offering the sacrifices and came in to disrupt it
James appreciated the law, calling it the 'perfect law, the law of freedom' and the 'royal law,' as the psalmists did in the Old Testament
The law was the way by which God dealt with His people in the Old Testament, but James is in the New Testament
The law was the way God dealt with His Old Testament saints, and grace is the new way in which God deals with His New Testament saints
It uses the terms of the Old Testament Jews, such as 'the twelve tribes,' 'synagogue,' and 'the Lord of hosts ' in 1:1; 2:2; 5:4
James's teaching was a mixture of God's New Testament chosen people the believers with God's Old Testament elect the Jews
James brought in a mixture of the church practice with the Jews' way of meeting to worship God in the synagogues
Among men, there are three kinds of persons: the ethical, moral person; the natural person; and the regenerated person
Before Paul was saved, when he was Saul, he said that according to the righteousness of the law he was blameless, perfect
After he received God's life and God's Spirit through regeneration, he lived no more as an ethical person but as a spiritual person
He was a regenerated person in his regenerated humanity, and this humanity was mingled with divinity because God lived in him
In his Epistle he spoke of regeneration and the Spirit's indwelling, but he also talked about perfection in the realm of self-cultivation
The first tragic issue of James's mistake is the blinding of thousands of believers from James's time to today
The New Jerusalem has a strong base, and this strong base is God the Father's divine nature, signified by gold
The entire holding strength of the holy city is God's divine nature, and this base should be the base of our Christian life and work
The base, the gates, and the wall of the city are the basic building, whereas the throne, the temple, and the light are the furnishings
An oyster lives in the salty water and is wounded by a grain of sand to produce a pearl by secreting its life-juice
By these six steps the Spirit, as the third One of the Divine Trinity, will finish His transforming work to make us completed pearls
Verse 9 says, 'For we rejoice whenever we are weak and you are powerful; this also we pray for, your perfecting'
Verse 14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
Satan's word is recorded in the Bible, and that record is by the inspiration of the Spirit, but the word recorded is not the word of God
In the book of Job, thirty-five chapters, 3 37, are a record of the words spoken by Job, his three friends, and Elihu
After the Lord finished His speaking, Job said to Him, 'I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee
He wants us to receive Him into us to be our everything, even to transform us into His image so that we can become His expression
The Christian perfection is for the expression of the Triune God, not for the expression of our integrity or uprightness
James's teaching of Christian perfection, though, is self-cultivation; it is to cultivate the bright virtue in man created by God
You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men'
Christ as the Son of God has the ministry of grace for accomplishing God's eternal economy to establish the church as His Body
It also indicates that he did not know the preeminence of Christ both in God's old creation and God's new creation
Peter and all others should listen only to Christ as the Son of God, the Beloved, in whom God has found His delight
Peter's word here was stopped by the voice from heaven, saying, 'The things that God has cleansed , do not make common'
Every portion, even a single word, of the Scripture should be interpreted with and according to the entire Scripture
The interpretation of the Scripture should be strictly governed by this central line under its adequate enlightenment
