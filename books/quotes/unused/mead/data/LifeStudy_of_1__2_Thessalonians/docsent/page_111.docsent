   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>No Escape</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I would like to say a word especially to the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because you were selected by God in eternity past, there is no point in trying to run away from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In a very real sense, God is a great fisherman, and He has "hooked" you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God hooked you in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, there is no way you can get off His hook.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In eternity past God spread many hooks attached to long strings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The hook on which you were caught was floating free until one day the hook came to you, and you were caught.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now you cannot get off the hook.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God the Father has chosen you, and you cannot escape.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE APPLICATION OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After man was created, he fell and became corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, God the Son came to redeem us and accomplish what God had planned.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Following that, God the Spirit came to apply what God had planned and what Christ, the Son of God, had accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This application is sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may not have had any thought concerning God or any heart toward Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nevertheless, one day we were caught by the Spirit, and the Spirit began to apply what the Father has planned and what the Son has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As a result, for no apparent reason, we came to believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even though our friends, neighbors, schoolmates, and associates may not believe in Christ, we cannot help believing in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I can testify of this from my own experience.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One day I began to love the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I have never seen Him, but I love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is so good to me!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Others may say that this is superstitious and regard Jesus as nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To them I would say, "You may not care for the Lord Jesus, but I love Him."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is not any kind of superstition.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is the application of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we have pointed out, the application of the Spirit is what Paul means in 2:13 by sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we receive the application of the Spirit, we are separated to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>My friends and classmates could not understand what had happened to me, and I myself could not explain it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I only know that, at the age of nineteen, I suddenly lost my interest in other things and cared only for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I loved to pray, call on the Lord's name, read the Bible, go to meetings, and tell others how lovable the Lord Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Certain people wondered who hired me to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I told them, "I have not been hired by anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rather, I am willing to spend as much money as possible to print tracts that I myself have written."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This was my early experience of the sanctification of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When I was a young person, I loved to play soccer.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One day, after I was saved, I was playing soccer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At a certain time, when the ball came to me, something within said, "Stop!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Don't play any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Leave the soccer field."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All the players were shocked; they did not know what had happened to me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then I walked off the field and told them that I would not play soccer any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>That was an experience of the sanctification of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many of us can give testimonies concerning the Spirit's sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even though you may be very young in the Lord, the Spirit is nevertheless being applied to you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whatever the Spirit applies to you is an aspect of your sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because we have experienced the application of the Spirit, we do not have the freedom to do certain things that others are able to do.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is not a matter of teaching; it is a matter of God the Spirit living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God the Father loves us and has chosen us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God the Son died for us and accomplished redemption for us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now God the Spirit has come to apply all this to us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I believe that many of the sisters can testify that being sanctified by the Spirit affects their shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because they have been sanctified by the Spirit, their shopping has become different.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As they are considering the purchase of a particular item, the Spirit within them may say, "Don't touch that."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Spirit may say no much more than He says yes.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>No one teaches the sisters to change their way of shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The different way of shopping is the result of the sanctification of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is in this sanctification of the Spirit that we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is salvation in sanctification of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is very easy for a husband and wife to exchange words.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is extremely common in married life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But I can testify that in the sanctification of the Spirit I have been saved from exchanging words with my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If I did not have the sanctification of the Spirit, I would probably exchange words with my wife every day.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, I can testify before the Lord that in my married life I have been saved in sanctification of the Spirit from exchanging words with my wife.</S>
