At the beginning of the Lord's recovery in the United States in Elden Hall, Pentecostal people sometimes came among us and spoke in tongues
Because we are not denominational, but general, the brothers who come into the Lord's recovery have the liberty to practice what they want
Throughout the years we have given many messages on the Lord as the Spirit living in us that we may enjoy His life to live Him
He was general to such an extent that he was even convinced by James to go to the temple to help people consummate the Nazarite vow
Paul was condemned of cheating others ; the Lord Jesus was cheated; and we have been cheated and falsely condemned
We have learned that it is best to be simple, single, and uncomplicated, staying away from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
Without Judas, the Lord could not have been betrayed and delivered into the hand of the Pharisees for His crucifixion to be consummated
In these days we have to be for the Lord's interest by taking care of the Lord and taking care of His Body to discern the real situation
The only difference was that Brother Nee was the 'umbrella' at that time, so the covering umbrella eventually became the target
We need to let go of all the negative things and go on in a positive way to practice the church life according to the scriptural way
Eventually, if something is really of the Lord, it will be vindicated by the Lord, and many will receive the help
In the Thanksgiving conference of 1992 we spoke concerning the constitution and building up of the Body of Christ
All the saints need to see this, but regardless of how much you expect that the saints will see, not many shall see
Eventually what we see today is the great religion of Christianity with Catholicism, Protestantism, and Brethrenism
Today He is speaking to the twelfth tribe, the Lord's recovery, which has recovered the New Testament revelation back to the early apostles
A number of saints accept the recovery and come into the recovery, but they try to do their own work in the recovery
We should be more than strong and strict in the above-listed items of the basic truths in carrying out the Lord's recovery
Since certain ones are trying to make divisions among us and trying to cause others to stumble, what shall we do?
Moses and Aaron had to reject their natural relationship and affection in order to follow God's speaking to deal with Miriam
The proper one who has the written word and the living word has the discernment to judge whether or not someone has leprosy
Some were not clear and strong to keep the truth to maintain the feeling of the Body, which comprises all the churches
In the recovery we need not merely the knowing but the seeing of a revelation, which has to become a vision to us
The problem today among us is that thousands of saints, lovers of Christ, have come into the recovery but they are short of sight
After someone gave a testimony, Brother Nee would criticize it, telling the person that he had never seen the Body
He told them that what they had received was mere 'head knowledge,' instead of a real seeing of the Body of Christ
Among the several writers who wrote parts of the New Testament, only one used the term the Body of Christ-the apostle Paul
Within this frame there is the Triune God as the very essence, element, and source for His divine constitution with humanity
The Triune God-the Spirit, the Lord, and God the Father-has been constituted organically with His chosen people in their humanity
We did not have zoe before we were saved, but we had bios and psuche, the physical life and the psychological life
The Body of Christ is an organism constituted with the divine life, the life of the processed and consummated Triune God
Some Christian teachers said that our human body is real and that the Body of Christ is just a figure of speech
The five problems among us which we have covered in the previous message are due to the shortage of sight concerning the Body of Christ
The worldly people use this word to refer to the monetary economy, but this is not the way the holy Scriptures use this word
Many of these notes have been incorporated into our Recovery Version of the New Testament and our Life-study of the New Testament
We need to see that God's economy as God's plan, His administration, is to create, to constitute, and to produce a Body for His Son
God the Father is there as the shining One , Christ is there as the tree of life , and the Spirit is there as the river of water of life
God's economy does have another aspect on the negative side, and that aspect is the destruction of God's enemy
These are the two aspects concerning the Body of Christ in the fulfilling of God's desire for His expression and the destruction of Satan
Surely Paul did not keep his hands off of the churches which he established or the leading ones whom he appointed
The twenty-three verses of Ephesians 1 issue in the church as the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all
Ephesians tells us clearly that the church the gathering of Gods calledout ones is not an organization but an organism the Body of Christ
When Brother Nee taught about the Body he said that with whatever we do, we have to consider how the churches would feel about it
When we do something, we must not forget that we are members of the Body, and the Body is not only a local church
The Body is the Body of Christ, constituted by the Triune God with all the believers on this earth, with all the local churches
In 1 Corinthians 12:18 Paul said, 'God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, even as He willed'
An apostle must be one who preaches the gospel to save sinners, who forms and establishes churches, and who discerns and teaches the truth
On the one hand, we can accept and we should accept the real Christians, but we cannot strengthen or justify their denominations
We say that we love all the dear saints in the denominations, but we cannot confirm or justify the denominations
To build up the clerical class and thus annul the functions of the members of the Body of Christ is evil in the eyes of God
We have to realize who has the function and qualification as the priest to discern leprosy among the Lord's children
In a sense, we may say that a local church is autonomous only to a certain degree in practical and business affairs
Whether a local church should buy a piece of land to build a hall or rent a hail is according to their discernment
Receiving a person who has made trouble in the recovery and who is still making trouble involves the Body very much
The Body surely will check with a local church if there is a division-maker among them whom they have not disciplined
The Lord desires to recover the missed Body of Christ and to recover the neglected oneness of the Body of Christ
If a relative of ours is making divisions or living in sin, it would be wrong to allow him to participate in the Lord's table
Surely he still needs to respect and honor his father, but he cannot bring this family regulation into the church life
The book of Acts tells us that Barnabas made a mistake because of his natural relationship with Mark, his cousin
If we put the notification of so many churches aside and go to investigate the situation for ourselves, this is an offending to the Body
On the one hand, the father is for the members of his family, and on the other hand, the members of the family are for the father
Such a universal Body is like the father to all the churches, and all the churches are like the children to the father
Some among us enjoyed the inheritance from the Body, but then they gave up the Body and would not care for the Body
According to the book of Revelation, the Catholic church, which is a great part of Christianity, has become a great harlot
They may say that the Holy Spirit appointed them, but the Bible does not say that the elders are appointed merely by the Holy Spirit
The Bible says that the apostles appointed the elders and that eventually the Spirit recognized that appointment
Without the backing of the Body, without the backing of the recovery, we have no way to practice the local churches
If we come back to the truth and take care of the proper order in the Body, the Body will immediately become stronger
If a person desires to gain something for himself and does not get it, he may feel that he has been mistreated
On the one hand, we have to make our standing clear that we do not agree with the divisions made by certain division-makers
At that time, you may meet a man while you are standing in line at the bank, and as a result you may gain him and his entire family
If you go out faithfully and consistently every week for two hours, you surely can gain one person as remaining fruit in a year
The Lord said that the seed sown on the good earth bears fruit and produces either a hundredfold, sixtyfold, or thirtyfold
We have to perfect them by the mutual asking and answering of questions, the mutual teaching, in the group meetings
We must enter into the intrinsic significance of the holy Scriptures to find out what the Lord says and what He wants
