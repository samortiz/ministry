   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RULING OVER THE THREE MAJOR ENEMIES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As kings reigning in life, we must subdue the enemies and rule over them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do not regard your wife or husband as an enemy over whom you must rule.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to both the Gospel of John and the book of Romans, our major enemies are sin, death, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Not even your temper is one of the primary enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If sin, death, and Satan are defeated, your temper will also be defeated and even become something of comeliness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sin is what makes your temper so distasteful.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the same principle, the reason the self is so ugly is that sin, death, and Satan make their abode within us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If these things were subdued, even our self would be beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, we have just three major enemies sin, death, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul deals with these enemies in the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 8:2, which speaks of the law of sin and death, we see two of the enemies, sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then in 16:20 Paul refers to Satan: Now the God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not expect to be a king over your wife or husband.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Husbands, the Lord has appointed you to be the head with respect to your wife, but not to be a king ruling over her.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Parents should not be kings over their children.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But we are to reign as kings over sin, death, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With respect to the members of our family and to the brothers and sisters in the church, we are servants.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But with respect to sin, death, and Satan, we are kings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>GOD DISPENSED INTO US</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>TO BE OUR PORTION</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we would know what it means for grace to reign unto eternal life, we must have a proper understanding of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Grace is God Himself given to us in Christ and dispensed into our spirit to be our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we have a thorough understanding of the Bible, we shall realize that God has no intention to give us anything other than Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All things other than God are vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Solomon, the wise king, said, Vanity of vanities; all is vanity Eccl.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the words of the Apostle Paul, all things apart from Christ are dung Phil 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our unique portion is God Himself, and grace is God as our portion for our participation, experience, and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we consider John 1:1 and 1:14 in context, we shall see that grace is God coming to us to be dispensed into us for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>John 1:16 says, For of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Romans 5:17 Paul speaks of receiving not only grace, but the abundance of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because grace is living and growing, it abounds.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This abounding grace also reigns.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Grace is not a lifeless element; it is a living Person, even God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>TWO KINGS</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Romans 5 both sin and grace are personified.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As verse 21 indicates, either sin or grace may reign, grace positively or sin negatively.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Sin is the embodiment of the evil nature of Satan in our flesh, and grace is God in Christ embodied in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, we have two kings sin and grace within us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In our flesh we have the king of sin, and in our spirit we have the king of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Within us a warfare is raging between these two kings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>RECEIVING ABUNDANCE OF GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You may be eager to know how you can have the abundance of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The only way to have it is to receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In receiving we neither labor nor pay a price.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We simply receive.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Both John and Romans speak of receiving grace.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have seen that John 1:16 says that of His fullness we have received grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Romans 5:17 Paul speaks of our receiving the abundance of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to come to the very God who is grace and receive grace again and again until we are filled with grace.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Only when we are filled with grace can we experience the reigning of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When grace is allowed to fill us, it abounds in us and then reigns in us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The reigning grace always follows the abounding grace.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we are short of grace, grace cannot reign within us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Only when grace fills us up to the brim and then overflows from us can we experience the reigning of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When grace reigns, sin, death, and Satan are subdued and are under our feet, and we become kings in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As grace reigns in us, we reign in life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Do not consider that the experience of reigning in life by grace is an impossibility.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I can testify that it is surely possible for us to reign in life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Whenever we are filled with grace, grace overflows and reigns.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then by grace we reign in life over sin, death, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We are not only set free from the three major enemies, but we reign over them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The principle of reigning in life is revealed in chapter five, but the experience of reigning in life is in chapter eight.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Reigning in life is greater and higher than being saved in the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>OPENING TO BE FILLED</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In this matter doctrine, teaching, and exhortation are of no avail.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In a sense, not even our prayer is effectual in enabling us to reign in life by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The only thing that works is to come to the divine source and open ourselves from the depths of our being to be filled with God as grace.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In order to be filled, we must ask the Lord to remove all insulation and frustration.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We need to pray, Lord, I am willing for every hindrance to be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I want to keep myself directly open to You.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Lord, fill me completely with Yourself as grace.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Wherever you are, at work, at school, or in your car, stay open to the Lord to be filled with Him as grace.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is what it means to receive the abundance of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>As you receive grace in this way, you will be filled with grace and eventually grace will overflow from within you.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Then you will reign in life by grace over sin, death, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In your experience these three enemies will be utterly subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Sin, death, and Satan are still working within us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But if we come to the heavenly source and open ourselves thoroughly to be filled with grace, we shall reign over them in life.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is our need today in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Although I appreciate very much all that is in the Gospel of John, we must go on from John to Romans 5:17 and 21 to receive abundance of grace so that grace may reign within us and we may reign in life.</S>
