   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE POWER OF CHOOSING Issue No. 16 Scripture Reading: Isa 7:1-2, 10-15</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We are here today for one thing only, which is to learn more concerning the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All of us know how perfect the Lord was when He was on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In reading the four Gospels, we can see how good and perfect the outward living of the Lord was.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Yet from the four Gospels, we cannot tell why the Lord had such a superb outward living.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Why was He so perfect, and why was He such a Son of Man?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Isaiah 7:15 gives us the reason He had such a living.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Why was He able to refuse the evil and choose the good?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How did He know to reject the world and choose God's will?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How did He know to reject glory from men and choose glory from God?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We can find out the answer to these questions from Isaiah 7.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 14 says, "Behold, the virgin will conceive and will bear a son, and she will call his name Immanuel."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We know that this refers to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Unfortunately, many people have dropped verse 15.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should know that not only does verse 14 refer to the Lord, but that verse 15 also refers to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 15 tells us that He ate butter and honey all his life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because He ate butter and honey all His life, He was able to choose the good things and refuse the bad things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is why He could obey God, seek for His glory, and win His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What is the significance of butter and honey?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Among all the tasteful foods, butter is the richest of them all.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Moreover, nothing in the world is sweeter than honey.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Butter is the richest food, while honey is the sweetest food.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord Jesus ate the richest and sweetest food throughout His life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is why He could reject the evil and choose the good.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Bible tells us what the richest thing is.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible also tells us what the sweetest thing is.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All the time, God placed before Christ the rich grace and gave Him to taste the sweet love.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is why He could obey God and choose His will.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is why He could reject the evil and choose the good.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today we will consider a little how the Lord ate butter and honey, and how He rejected the evil and chose the good.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I. THE LORD'S YOUTH</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>LUKE 2:41-51</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the age of twelve, our Lord went with His parents to Jerusalem to keep the feast.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After the feast His parents returned, but He remained in Jerusalem without their knowing about it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Later His parents returned to Jerusalem to look for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After three days they found Him in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>His mother said, "Child, why have You treated us like this?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Behold, Your father and I, being greatly distressed, have been seeking You."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord did not answer saying, "Do you not know that I should do My Father's will?"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead, He answered, saying, "Did you not know that I must be in the things of My Father?"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord had eaten the butter and the honey.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At the age of twelve, the Lord knew the Father already.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He had the heavenly butter and honey.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He had received the richest and the sweetest and was living in God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If it were us, we might have said, "Go back to Nazareth to care for your carpentry and your housework.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I will not go.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Let me stay in the temple."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our Lord did not behave this way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He spoke, and He testified; yet He went back with them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After they returned to Nazareth, He was subject to them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The reason He could choose the difficult thing was that God had given Him the richest and sweetest taste.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Mary was a very good woman.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At the same time she was a very small woman.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The better a person is in the world, the smaller his head is.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Often, the best persons have the smallest heads; they are the most muddled ones.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In reading the four Gospels, we see that Mary bothered the Lord all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When the wine ran out, she told Him, "They have no wine" John 2:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>While He was preaching to many people, she would come to speak with Him Matt 12:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Yet the Bible says that "He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This was the Lord's choice.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It was something that others would find hard to do.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He could have rejected them and stayed in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But He chose to return with them and to live with a simple-minded and ignorant Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The reason for this is that He had eaten butter and honey and was able to choose what was otherwise unbearable to men.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>BEING BAPTIZED BY JOHN THE BAPTIST</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>MATTHEW 3:13-17</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When John saw Jesus coming to him, he said, "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!"</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Later he said, "He who is coming after me is stronger than I."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>How much stronger?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He said, "Whose sandals I am not worthy to carry."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Lord Jesus was so great!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Yet He came to be baptized by John.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we had come and were so great, with such seniority, being preeminent from eternity and being King of the heavenly kingdom, we would have shown ourselves off.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Although we may not say anything with our mouth, subconsciously we would show ourselves off as being better than others.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We are born proud, and we love to show that we are greater than everyone else in front of everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Yet the Lord came to the Jordan and was baptized by John.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Is it an easy thing to be baptized by others?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>There was an old sister in Foochow who was a very nice person.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>She realized that she needed to be baptized, but she wanted to choose the person who would baptize her.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Some brothers were well-respected in her eyes, while others were not well- respected in her eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>She had made up her mind not to be baptized by a certain brother and designated another person to baptize her.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>All those who are a little better off than others in this world try to select some well-respected ones to baptize them.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Our Lord was very peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>He was extremely extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Even John the Baptist marveled and tried to stop Him, saying, "It is I who have need of being baptized by You, and You come to me?"</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>What did the Lord say?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He said, "Permit it for now, for it is fitting for us in this way to fulfill all righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He was willing to go to the Jordan, to the death water.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>He chose humiliation and death.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>He fulfilled all righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Righteousness was actually fulfilled on the cross, but it was first expressed in the death water.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>He chose the good and rejected the evil.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Consider how much trouble there was for the Lord to be baptized by John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The Lord would lose all His "loftiness" before the world, the sinners, the tax collectors, and the prostitutes, for they were all baptized by John as well.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>When the Lord began to preach, He said the same thing that John did: "The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God has drawn near.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Repent" Mark 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The audience was the same group of people as those who had heard John.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>A tax collector among them might say, "Was He not baptized together with us on that day?</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Why, He is teaching us today!"</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Another sinner might repeat, "Was He not baptized together with us on that day?</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>And now He is teaching us today!"</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This would surely have been embarrassing and unsightly.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Later, trouble did occur.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>When the Lord and His disciples went to live in Judea and baptized men there, some came to John saying, "He who was with you across the Jordan, of whom you have testified, behold, He is baptizing and all are coming to Him" John 3:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>They despised Him.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The Lord had put Himself in a most difficult position.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Yet He chose this.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>The reason is that behind Him there was power; He had tasted of the rich grace and the sweet love.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>He had eaten the butter and the honey.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>He had tasted the richest and sweetest.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>This is why He was able to humble Himself to the lowest.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>If we can ever humble ourselves, and if we are ever willing to humble ourselves, it is because we have the butter, the richest grace, and the honey, the sweetest love.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>This is why we can humble ourselves before men.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>This is why we are willing to humble ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>The world cannot do this, but we can because we have the richest grace and the sweetest love.</S>
