They have come on time to every meeting, and everyone speaks with short testimonies. During the past two Lord's Day evenings at the bread-breaking meetings, we were joined by a few new believers: Brother Hu, Sister Wang, and Brother Suen. We are all very young. Please remember the church in Ku-Jiu all the time. May the Lord bless all the brothers and sisters.</p><p>Brother Gung En-lung, May 18</p><h2 class="head2">Hong Kong</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Recently, the number of refugees suddenly increased. Yesterday the newspaper said, "In one week there has been an increase of one hundred seventy thousand people. Since the start of the war, the population in Hong Kong has swollen by four hundred thousand. Rents in some places have doubled, and prices have increased by thirty-five percent. The British government is already trying to stamp out the flooding in of refugees." Brothers and sisters among the refugees are increasing day by day. Finding lodging for them has become a big problem. In the house of Brother Hsie from Amoy, over thirty people are being housed temporarily. Many brothers have not been able to find lodging after many days. We need the Lord's special grace under such circumstances. The Lord has opened the door to the work in Hong Kong recently. I regret that I am too weak and useless to meet all the needs.</p><p>Brother Philip Luan, June 8</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Recently, rent in Hong Kong has skyrocketed, and many refugees are suffering unnecessarily. It seems that all the houses and all the streets are full of people. What a pitiful sight!</p><p>Philip Luan, June 12</p><h2 class="head2">Macao</h2><p>Thank the Lord! He has shown me clearly through the situation along the south coast of China that I should move away from Chungshan. On the afternoon of May 26, I arrived safely at my aunt's house in Macao. On the Lord's Day afternoon, we had a meeting at the house of the brother-in-law of Rev. Ma Mu. All five brothers from CBC Laboratories came to the meetings. Brother Chang Shi-wu is leaving Macao today to go to Shanghai via Hong Kong. Yesterday, I saw Mrs. Yeh, the sister of Sister Liu Shu-bao, at Mrs. Ma's house. We prayed together. The Lord willing, I may go to Hong Kong later. Presently, I will stay in Macao for a while. Please pray for me.</p><p>Sister Roh-chen, May 31</p><h2 class="head2">Penang, Malaysia</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Enclosed please find X dollars for The Open Door and for the brothers and sisters in difficulty. Please use it according to the Lord's leading. May all the glory go to God's name. Greetings to all the brothers and sisters.</p><p>The assembly in Penang,<br />Juang Dah-deh, Yang Jien-hsiung, Chang Nai-tsung,<br />Tseng Pei-ran<br />[Address omitted]</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> </body></html>
