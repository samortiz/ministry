   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Lesson Twelve FORGIVENESS AND CLEANSING OF SINS Scripture Reading Jer 31:34; Zech 13:1; Matt 26:28;</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Heb 9:12-14, 22-23; 1 John 1:7-9; Rev 1:5 Outline Forgiveness of Sins Forgetting our Sins Forgiveness Cleansing Text I. FORGIVENESS OF SINS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After sinning against God, man needed God s forgiveness and cleansing of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since we have offended God, we need His forgiveness; yet we cannot be forgiven before His righteousness is fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>So, we must die to satisfy God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But, if we die, God would have no one to receive His life for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The perfect solution to this problem was for Christ to come and die for us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because of His death, God s righteous requirement has been met, and we can now be forgiven by God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A. Forgetting Our Sins</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to Jeremiah 31:34, for God to forgive our sins is for Him to forget them, too.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we forgive someone for offending us, we seldom forget what they did to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, God is different.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When He forgives our sins, He does not remember them anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because of Christ s death and our believing in Him, we can be forgiven by God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When God forgives our sins, He forgets them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To Him, it is just as though we have never sinned!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Just by believing this, you are forgiven!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>B. Forgiveness</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Son s redemption through His blood is the forgiveness of our offenses Matt 26:28; Heb 9:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Redemption is what Christ has accomplished for our offenses; forgiveness is what Christ accomplished applied to our offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Redemption was accomplished on the cross, whereas forgiveness is applied the moment we believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Redemption and forgiveness are actually two ends of one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have seen that the forgiveness of offenses is the redemption accomplished through the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, two terms are used because this one thing has two ends: the end of the accomplishment on the cross and the end of the application to us at the time we believed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although redemption was accomplished on the cross when Christ shed His blood, it was not applied to us at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The application did not take place until we believed in Christ and made confession to the righteous God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At that very moment, the Spirit of God applied to us the redemption Christ had accomplished on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, redemption is the accomplishment, and forgiveness is the application.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>CLEANSING</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What is the difference between forgiving and cleansing?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In order to know this difference, we need to know the difference between sins and unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Sins refer to offenses, and unrighteousness is the mark, the stain, on our behavior caused by the committing of an offense.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whenever we sin, we commit an offense.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This offense then becomes a stain on our behavior, and this stain is unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For instance, suppose you buy two items, but you are charged only for one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you pay for just one item, that will be an act of sinning against the store.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>With respect to the person who sold you the items, that is an offense.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But with respect to your character, that is a mark of unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For this reason, others would not say that you are sinful, but would say that you are unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In a similar way, when we commit sins before God, with respect to God those sins are offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But with respect to us, they are stains of unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need to confess our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then, on the one hand, God forgives our sins, our offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the other hand, God washes away the mark, the stain, of our unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the reason John in 1 John 1:9 speaks both of the forgiveness of sins and the cleansing from unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The forgiveness of sins is actually the cleansing, the washing away, of the stain of our unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Questions Why does man need God s forgiveness and cleansing?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How is God able to forgive man righteously?</S>
