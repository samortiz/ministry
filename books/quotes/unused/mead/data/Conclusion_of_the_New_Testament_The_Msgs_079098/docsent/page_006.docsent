   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>L. THE SPIRIT OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The term "the Spirit of life" is used only once in the New Testament in Romans 8:2.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Spirit is not only the life-giving Spirit but also the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Spirit of life is the reality of life, for this Spirit contains the element of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Actually, the Spirit Himself is life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, with the Spirit of life we have the riches of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The way to have life is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Life belongs to the Spirit, and the Spirit is of life.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The New Testament reveals that Christ is life John 11:25 , even our life Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, Christ can be life to us only in the reality of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, it is actually the Spirit of life who is life to God's chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Triune God as the Spirit of life makes sinners into sons of God who become the living members of the Body of Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For the Spirit to be the Spirit of grace means that the Triune God in the Son as the Spirit becomes our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Spirit is the reaching of the Triune God to us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Son could not come into us until He had become the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He was among the disciples, but He needed to go through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit John 14:16-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then He was able to breathe Himself as the Spirit into the disciples for their enjoyment John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As the Spirit of grace, the Spirit is the reality of grace.</S>
