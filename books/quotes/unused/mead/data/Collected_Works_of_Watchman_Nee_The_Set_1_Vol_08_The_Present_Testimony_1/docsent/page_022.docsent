   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>AN OPEN LETTER Issue No. 5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>My original desire was that one issue of The Present Testimony would be published each month.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But we have only been able to publish this one issue after three months.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since I finished The Spiritual Man, my whole being has been exhausted, physically and mentally, and I have had no choice but to rest for a while.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I have really stretched myself even to get this issue finished.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To those brothers who wrote to me, I need your special patience, for I do not have time to answer each one of you.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord's work is still going on; we are encouraged by many things, but at the same time we are also grieved by many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nevertheless, God is the Lord of all.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because our burden is very heavy today, I beg my brothers and sisters to pray for me and all my co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do not think that I do not need anyone to pray for me; actually, my need for your prayers is great.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One thing which has comforted me very much is that we are one in spirit and that no geographical difference can separate us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our life of oneness in the Lord is so strong that nothing in this universe can separate us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If the Head and the Body are not separated by the distance between heaven and earth, is it not the same for the members of the Body?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Editor</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>August 1928</S>
