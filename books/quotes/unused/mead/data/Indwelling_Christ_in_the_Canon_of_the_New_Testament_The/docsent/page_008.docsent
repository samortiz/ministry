   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE BAPTISM AND THE INDWELLING Scripture Reading: Matt 3:11a; 28:19-20b; Rom 6:3, 4a; Gal 3:27-28; 1 Cor 12:13a</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that God took two steps in order to work Himself into us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He became flesh, and He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jesus was the last Adam in the flesh, but through death and resurrection He was made the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He became flesh for our redemption, and He became the life-giving Spirit to impart His life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE GOAL OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christianity stresses very much the part of redemption, but they miss the main goal of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have heard many messages about redemption in Christianity, but we have never heard that Jesus as the last Adam was made the life-giving Spirit in order to impart Himself into us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We had sin, but we did not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>So Jesus was made flesh to take away our sin, and He became the life-giving Spirit to impart to us His life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Altogether, the Lord took seven steps in seven stages.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There was the incarnation, the crucifixion, the resurrection, the ascension, the baptism, the indwelling, and the advent.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The incarnation means the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The crucifixion means the termination of all the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The resurrection means the germination of new life with a new start in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The ascension means that Jesus as a man was inaugurated into the new position of King of kings and Lord of lords to be the Head over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then on the day of Pentecost and at the house of Cornelius, He came as the Baptizer to put all His people into Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Following this, He began to indwell all His members for transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By His transformation we will be made mature and He will come back.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The advent will mean the transfiguration of our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then we all will be fully, wholly, and thoroughly the same as He is, both inwardly and outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This will be the New Jerusalem, which is a consummate expression of all that God has been working out in these seven steps.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>INTO HIM, INTO US</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this message we must see something more concerning the relationship between the indwelling and the baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These stages are closely related to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The baptism was to put us into Him, and the indwelling is to put Him into us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Baptism means that we are in Christ, and the indwelling means that Christ is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many times in the New Testament we have these two phrases, in Christ and Christ in us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We were baptized into Christ, and then Christ came into us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Of the four Gospels, the first is Matthew and the last is John.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is quite meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Why was the Gospel of John not first, and why was Matthew not last?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This would be like putting the head under the feet, and the feet on the neck.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It wouldn t fit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To have Matthew first and John last is really fitting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But many Christians have not seen the preciousness of these two books.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No other books in the Bible reveal as much of the Triune God as these two books.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The name of the Triune God is clearly revealed in Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is not one verse in the Old Testament that tells us so clearly about the Trinity as Matthew 28:19.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Of course Genesis and Isaiah give us some hint, because they both use the pronoun us for God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But Matthew twenty-eight makes it so clear and definite: Baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, we should realize that this clear word did not come until the Lord Jesus was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is in the very last part of the last chapter of the book.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Chapter one tells us that Jesus was born of a virgin, and His name was called Emmanuel, God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was just a little, despised man, but He was God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After living for some thirty-three years, He was crucified, buried, and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then He became the life-giving Spirit, who is the all-inclusive realization, reality, and embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He came back to His disciples as such a One, One who includes the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then He told them, Go ye therefore, and disciple all nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In chapter one we have Emmanuel, but in the last chapter, God with us becomes the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We could never be baptized into Emmanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He was just a little man called Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We could never get into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>John the Baptist prophesied in Matthew three that He is the One who will baptize us in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But where is the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It was not until His resurrection that He came back in another wonderful form.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He was made the life-giving Spirit, and He came back in such a wonderful way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He had a body which you could touch, yet He came through closed doors!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then He told the disciples to go and disciple the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When He was in the flesh as a man, He could not put people into Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But after He was resurrected, He was made the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He was no more simply the man, Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He was now the ultimate, all-inclusive, realization, reality, and embodiment of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>After speaking of putting people into the Triune God, the Lord told His disciples that He would be with them unto the completion of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We are baptized into the Triune God, yet Jesus is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>So who is Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Jesus is just the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The proper interpretation of this verse has been completely missed by Christianity.</S>
