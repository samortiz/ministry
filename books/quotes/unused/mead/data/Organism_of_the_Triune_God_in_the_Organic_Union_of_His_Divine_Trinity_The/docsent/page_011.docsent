   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Regenerating Christ s Redeemed Ones</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The work of the Spirit is firstly to regenerate Christ s redeemed ones John 3:6b .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our regeneration was instantaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After hearing the gospel, we repented, prayed, and called on the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>While we were praying and calling, we were regenerated by the Spirit in an instant.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this sense, receiving regeneration was easy for us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the work of the regenerating Spirit is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Spirit uses Christ s death and resurrection and the divine life to regenerate us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ s death terminated what we were in the past and released His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His life-imparting resurrection germinated the terminated ones.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The death of Christ killed us and the resurrection of Christ enlivened us with the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ s death, His resurrection, and the divine life are all needed for the working Spirit to regenerate us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Without His death, His resurrection, and the divine life, we could not have been regenerated regardless of how much we prayed and called on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But today we can be regenerated instantly because the death of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, and the releasing and imparting of the divine life has been accomplished by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The regenerating Spirit regenerates Christ s redeemed ones with the death, resurrection, and the divine life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When a person calls O Lord Jesus, he is instantly regenerated by the Holy Spirit with these elements.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Regeneration is the very beginning of the organic union of the divine Trinity within us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To be regenerated is to be organically united to the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To install electricity into a building, there is the need of a long wire to connect the power plant to the building.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many wires are then installed throughout the building to bring the electricity to all the rooms.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For the electricity to be applied to the building, the switch must be turned on.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The turning on of the switch brings the current of electricity into the building.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ accomplished everything for us so that we could receive the divine electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He installed a long wire from the power plant in the third heavens to us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The preaching of the gospel was the practical installation of the wires within us, in our mind, emotion, will, and conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since all the wires were installed, all that was needed was the turning on of the switch.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we called O Lord Jesus, the switch was turned on and we were united to the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our regeneration was the beginning of our organic union, our union in life, with the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Indwelling the Regenerated Saints</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The regenerating Spirit then begins to indwell the regenerated saints Rom 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After our regeneration, the regenerating Spirit stays in us, indwells us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Since the time that we called O Lord Jesus, we began to sense that Someone is within us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sometimes this indwelling One is comforting, enlightening, and refreshing, but many times He is very troublesome to us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the one hand, a husband receives much comfort from his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the other hand, he may be troubled by her.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His wife may correct and restrict him in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The husband may like to be free.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He may not want to be regulated, limited, or controlled by anyone or anything.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the same way, we believers may feel that we are regulated too much by the indwelling One.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The indwelling One is always regulating us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The regenerating Spirit becomes the indwelling Spirit to be the regulating law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If He did not indwell us, He could not be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Renewing the Spirit-indwelt Saints</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>With the indwelling Spirit, there is the renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He renews the Spirit-indwelt saints Titus 3:5b; Eph 4:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Spirit renews us with a new element.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This new element is the Triune God Himself with all that He has passed through, accomplished, obtained, and attained.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Sanctifying the Renewed Saints</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Spirit then continues to sanctify the renewed saints Rom 15:16b .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The New Testament reveals that sanctification is not only to separate us unto God but also to change our nature with the holy nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Holiness is God s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God s holy nature must be worked into our nature to sanctify us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When God s holy nature is worked into our nature, this holy nature will change our human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is dispositional sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God s sanctifying us positionally does not require Him to work His holy nature into us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But for the dispositional, subjective sanctification, there is the need for the divine, holy nature to be wrought into our being, thus changing our nature into God s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Spirit uses the elements of all that the Triune God is, has passed through, and has accomplished, obtained, and attained to sanctify us.</S>
