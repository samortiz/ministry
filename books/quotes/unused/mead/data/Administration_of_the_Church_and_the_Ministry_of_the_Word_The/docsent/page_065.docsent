   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH GROUND THE BEGINNING OF THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we will speak concerning the type of testimony the Lord wants us to bear in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Regardless of how much we speak, however, we need a vision and revelation concerning these things so that we may have a genuine seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the beginning of the work in the East, God gave us the feeling that the condition of Christianity was not proper.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Ever since then we have had questions and doubts concerning today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These doubts caused us to consider the actual condition of Christianity and to study the Lord s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We saw that quite a number of practices in Christianity were not according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We abandoned these practices and in each item endeavored to return to the way it was in the beginning according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That period could be called the initial stage of the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the beginning we did not experience an instantaneous recovery of many items; instead, it was a recovery of item by item.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>During the first several years many items were recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although items began to be recovered in 1922, we consider that the recovery officially began in 1924.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The initial stage of the recovery was completed in 1934.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH GROUND</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the ground of the church was recovered, the recovery reached the end of the initial stage.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By 1925 we were clear that the church should not be divided into sects.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The church is one and should be in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is a sin for the church to be divided into various denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We were able to speak a little on the truth concerning sectarianism, but we were not clear concerning the definition of a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It was somewhere between 1928 and 1931 that we were able to define sectarianism.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We knew that if a church has a particular name, a particular fellowship, and a particular belief, it is a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, we were still not clear concerning the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even though we were clear that the church is one and should not be divided into sects and we knew the meaning of sectarianism, it was not until 1934 that the light concerning the expression of the church in a locality was clearly and accurately released to all the saints among us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many of us, however, were clear about the ground of the church in 1932.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>BROTHER NEE S SEEING OF THE CHURCH GROUND</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the first edition of the book The Orthodoxy of theChurch Brother Nee clearly stated that during a trip to Europe and America in 1933 he came in contact with a number of good Brethren groups.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He also contacted a number of reputable spiritual saints and joined their meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This was when he first contacted Brother T. Austin-Sparks.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Brother Nee took that trip because he had received an invitation from a Brethren group in London.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But he told them that his fellowshipping with them did not mean that he was joining the Brethren assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, he was not restricted by the Brethren when he was in England.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He found others, besides the Brethren, who knew the Lord, and he fellowshipped with them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He referred to this in The Orthodoxy of the Church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>During that trip abroad, Brother Nee visited many places.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some places had the condition of Philadelphia; they showed signs of the revival prophesied by the Lord in the seven epistles in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Other places were like Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Since some places had fallen into sin, others maintained a revived condition, and still others had divided repeatedly, it was impossible to make a general statement concerning their condition.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After observing the various conditions, particularly the divisions, Brother Nee began to question the basis for the divisions among the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He studied and examined all the issues related to the church in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After his study, he saw clearly from the Word of God that there is only one church in the universe, but when the church is expressed, it is expressed locality by locality; in other words, there is only one expression of the church in every locality.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The repeated divisions among the Brethren caused Brother Nee to study and see the light in God s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He saw that the church can have the distinction only of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The church in Corinth and the church in Ephesus were two separate churches.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The church in Ephesus and the church in Jerusalem were also two separate churches.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In addition, in Jerusalem there could not be two or more churches.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Similarly, in Ephesus there could not be two or more churches.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Brother Nee saw this from God s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Before Brother Nee went overseas in 1933, he was in northern China and stayed in my house for six days.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At that time the Lord s work had begun in northern China, but I was still working, so I fellowshipped with him to know what his feeling was concerning whether I should keep my job or serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He only said, Brother, when you are not clear, you should wait and see.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He returned from his trip overseas in the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>That fall I struggled within because the Lord wanted me to leave my job.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At about that time I received a letter from Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When he sent the letter, he was aboard a ship in the Mediterranean Sea on his way back from Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The letter was a great encouragement and a confirmation to me.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It read: Brother Witness, as for your future, I feel that you should serve the Lord with your full time.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>How do you feel?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>May the Lord lead you.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I received the letter more than one month after Brother Nee had written it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>By then I had already resigned from my job and had been laboring in Manchuria for three weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Upon returning from Manchuria, I read the letter from Brother Nee and was greatly encouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The letter was a strong confirmation to me.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Even though it had been six months since I parted with Brother Nee and he did not usually correspond with me, he sent such a simple, clear, timely word concerning leaving my job and serving full time.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The most amazing thing was that Brother Nee wrote the letter at about the same time I was struggling before the Lord whether to leave my job.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I felt deeply that this was the Lord s leading in this matter, so I determined to go to Shanghai to see Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In the fall I went to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>That was my first visit to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It was about that time that Brother Nee said he clearly saw the light concerning the ground of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He had just returned from England, and he saw this matter in the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>On the spiritual side, it was also at this time that he saw the central light concerning Christ as God s centrality and universality.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Therefore, he decided to call a national conference in January 1934.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>While I was in Shanghai, Brother Nee asked me to assist him in replying to some letters concerning spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I wrote a long letter on behalf of Brother Nee to Brother Hsieh Tien En from Canton.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This letter was later published in Collection of Newsletters see The Collected Works of Watchman Nee, vol. 25, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>77-80, 107-117 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The letter was mainly regarding denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>At that time we paid much attention to spiritual matters and denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Only Brother Nee was clear regarding the ground; the rest of us had not seen it.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We knew only that the church should be one and that denominations were wrong.</S>
