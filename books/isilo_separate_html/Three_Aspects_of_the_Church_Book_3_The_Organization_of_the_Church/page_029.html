<h1 class="title">THERE BEING<br />
NO ORGANIZATIONAL UNIFICATION<br />
AMONG THE CHURCHES</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXAMPLES IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>There should be oneness but no unification among the churches. The condition of the Roman Catholic Church today is that of unification. The word <em>catholic</em> means &ldquo;universal&rdquo; and denotes a kind of universal unification. According to God&rsquo;s word, God does not desire that the churches be unified. In the first twelve chapters of Acts, Peter was the leading figure. As such, he was in constant fellowship with different churches. However, in these chapters there is no indication of unification among the churches in Judea. The churches in Judea were one and in one accord, yet they were not unified. They were one in service and in faith, but they were not unified. The Bible does not speak of unification. Although apostles are extra-local and have been entrusted by God to take care of multiple local churches, there should be no unification among those churches.</p>
<p>According to the record in the second half of Acts, from chapter 13 onward, Paul took the lead in the work. He took care of the church in Ephesus, the church in Antioch, the church in Corinth, and the churches in many other places; nevertheless, there is no record of unification among the churches under his care. Not only was there no such unification in practice; there was not even a hint of this kind of unification. In other words, Peter did not unify the churches in Judea, and Paul did not unify the churches among the Gentiles. Among the churches in the Jewish and Gentile regions, the flow was one, and the Spirit was one. There was oneness and one accord among them, but there was no unification. We need to be very careful in this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO DANGERS</h2>
<p>We face two dangers. On the one hand, as soon as there is unification among churches, the presence of the Holy Spirit is lost, and the work of the Holy Spirit is limited. On the other hand, if we think that we can be careless and free because there is no unification, we will fall into the flesh, and all our actions will be out of the self. Unification causes us to lose the power of the Holy Spirit and the opportunity for the Holy Spirit to work. However, ignoring our oneness because there is no unification causes us to become unruly and to fall into a fleshly situation. These are the two dangers that we face.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT HAVING ORGANIZATIONAL UNIFICATION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Not Being Unified in the Move of the Work</h2>
<p>What does it mean to not have unification? We can explain this by using a few illustrations. For instance, for the past three years the brothers in Taiwan and the brothers overseas have been fellowshipping with me, hoping that some brothers from Taiwan could go to various places in Southeast Asia to work for the Lord in order to meet the need in these places. When I heard about the need, my heart was moved, but I did not feel at ease within. I was not sure why, but because of the uneasy feeling within, we have not dared to take any action, even though the need still exists.</p>
<p>Through spending time in the Lord&rsquo;s presence, we realized that this uneasy feeling was due to the danger of producing unification among the churches. If we were to send some brothers from Taiwan to various places in Southeast Asia, we would run the risk of producing a practice of unification. However, if some saints from Taipei, Kaohsiung, Taichung, or Hong Kong were to develop a burden within and a feeling that the Lord was calling them and commissioning them to go to Southeast Asia, whether it be one person or several people, we would bow our heads and say Amen. To act in this way would not result in unification.</p>
<p>However, if we were to summon a meeting of all the coworkers in order to discuss the need of Southeast Asia and then make an immediate decision regarding how to meet the need and whom and how many workers to send, this would be unification. Although there is indeed a great need in various places in Southeast Asia and a need for many to receive the Lord&rsquo;s commission, I have a solemn feeling that we should not take any action that might bring in the practice of unification. The most proper way to meet the need is for some of us to receive a burden from the Lord instead of having a unified move.</p>
<p>During the past few years, while traveling overseas, brothers have told me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, you should send some saints to us from Taiwan.&rdquo; Every time I heard this kind of speaking, I inwardly felt uneasy and uncomfortable. This kind of speaking is not accurate according to the truth. First, why should I be the one who sends people? Second, why should people be sent from Taiwan? This kind of speaking carries the flavor of organizational unification, and it is wrong. Because there should be no unification among the churches, there should be no center.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_028.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_030.html">Next</a> </body></html>
