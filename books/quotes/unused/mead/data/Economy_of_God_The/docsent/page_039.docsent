   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SENSE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How can we know when we are in the presence of God?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God is light v. 5 , and when we are in the presence of God, we can sense the light.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We sense not only the inner flowing but also the inner shining, which comes only through the fellowship of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is not a doctrine but an explanation of our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we cannot say Amen to these experiences, I am afraid there is something wrong with us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is exactly what we should have experienced since the day of our salvation, although we may not have been able to explain it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Allow me to repeat: something within us is moving and flowing, and when we are in the flow, we are simply in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then we have the shining within us, and everything is in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are clear about all things whether a certain thing is right or wrong, whether it is the will of God or not, and whether it is something of death or of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All things are made clear by the inner sense.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The sense of life, therefore, is very much related to the fellowship of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The fellowship of life helps us to realize the sense of life by bringing us into the presence of God, where we can enjoy the shining of God as light.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This shining makes us clear about everything.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It penetrates into every corner and avenue of our being, bringing to us a very tender and keen sense.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A slight mistake is immediately detected by this sense.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The more we have the flowing of life, the more we are in the presence of God, and the more shining we will experience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The more we experience this shining, the more we will realize a keen and tender sense.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is by this sense that we can know God, His will, and His way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This sense searches and tests everything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, this inward sense of life always depends on the degree of our inward relationship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we set our mind on the flesh, as the apostle pointed out in Romans 8:6, we are simply setting the self on the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To set the mind on the flesh means that our self is cooperating with the flesh, and if we cooperate with the flesh, our relationship with God, of course, is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I would remind you again of the three concentric circles illustrating the three parts of man see chapter 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The flesh is the body outer circle changed in nature through Satan s corrupting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The mind is in the soul middle circle , representing our human being, the self.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Triune God dwells in the spirit center circle .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The mind, located between the flesh and the spirit, has the possibility of moving in either direction.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should never forget Romans 8:6 it is one of the most important verses in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In a sense it is even more important than John 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we remember only John 3:16 and forget Romans 8:6, we are a Christian with a poor salvation; we can never be a victorious Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>John 3:16 is adequate for us to receive eternal life, but Romans 8:6 points out how to be a victorious Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To set our mind that is, to set our self on the flesh is death.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To set our mind, or our self, on the spirit is life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the key to death or life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The mind is quite neutral; it is on the fence.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It may turn toward the flesh, or it may turn toward the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Again, the story of the garden of Eden must be repeated.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Man s free will can make either of two choices.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Choosing the tree of knowledge results in death, but choosing the tree of life issues in life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are between these two; we are neutral with respect to life and death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The issue depends on our choice, our attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Personified sin, representing Satan, is in the flesh, the Triune God is in the spirit after we are saved, and the self is in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The secret of life or death depends on our cooperating with the spirit or with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we cooperate with the flesh, we have death; when we cooperate with the spirit, we are partakers of God, who is life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Sensing the Taste of Death</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How do we know that we are in a condition of death?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We know by sensing death.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Death gives us a certain kind of inward sense.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One such sense is that of emptiness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We sense death when we feel empty within.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Another sense death gives us is a sense of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we sense darkness within us, we are in death.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Death also gives us the feeling of uneasiness, which includes restlessness and disturbance.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There is no soothing within us; rather, there is the sense that everything within is in a state of friction, with no peace, no rest, no comfort, and no calm.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Another sense of death is weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Often we say, I cannot bear it any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This indicates that we are very weak.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have no strength, no power, no weight to stand against our frustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Finally, death gives us the sense of depression, oppression, or suppression.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Because we are weak, it is easy for us to be depressed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The reason for our weakness and depression is that our mind is set on the flesh, which results in death.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Emptiness, darkness, uneasiness, weakness, and depression all these are the tastes of the sense of death.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We know death within when we sense emptiness, darkness, uneasiness, weakness, and depression.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This kind of sense proves that we are in the flesh and are standing with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But this sense of death actually comes from the sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Suppose a person is truly dead and is therefore a corpse.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Such a person will not have any sense of emptiness, darkness, uneasiness, and so forth, because he does not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But if he has life within, though the life may be sickly and weak, he still has a certain sense of emptiness and darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He is able to sense all these things because he is still a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>As a living person he is contacting death, and it is the life within him that gives him the sense of death.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>One of the functions and purposes of the sense of life is to sense the taste of death.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Sensing the Taste of Life and Peace</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The sense of death, however, is only on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>On the positive side, there is the sense of life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>What is the sense, the taste, of life and peace?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>First of all, in contrast with emptiness, there is satisfaction and fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We sense that we are satisfied with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We are full in His presence and are neither thirsty nor hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Second, we sense light, the opposite of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Along with our inward satisfaction we have light shining within us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Every corner and every avenue of our being are full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Every part is transparent; nothing is opaque.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Then, in contrast to uneasiness, we have peace, which soothes all our disturbances.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Peace with rest, peace with comfort, peace with ease, is the sense within us.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>There is no feeling of friction or controversy.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Strength, as opposed to weakness, is another taste of the sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We feel the full strength and power of life.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>There is a living dynamo within us, and it seems as if there is not merely one motor but four motors.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Sometimes we feel the horsepower of a million horses.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>There is a real strengthening within us that overcomes all our weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We do not care about the long face of our wife.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If our wife speaks some unpleasant words to us, we will say Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Her words will not upset us and cause us to lose our temper, for we are strong.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We are not light and weak; we are weighty and full of power.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Nothing can turn us upside down.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This is the inner sense of life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Finally, in contrast with depression we have liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Through the flowing of life, we are not only liberated but also transcendent above all oppression.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Nothing can suppress us.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The more depression comes, the more we are in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This is the way that we perceive life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We simply perceive these two things by sensing them, and we sense them because we have life.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>This life within us is a flowing life.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Through the flowing of life we are living and in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Therefore, we have the deep, inward sense that we are satisfied, enlightened, strengthened, comforted, uplifted, liberated, and transcendent.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The more we are in the fellowship of life, the more we sense life, and the more we sense life, the more we enjoy the increased fellowship of life.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>These two are always experienced in cycles the more fellowship of life, the more sense of life; the more sense of life, the more fellowship of life.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>This is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The fellowship of life and the sense of life are byproducts of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>The main riches of resurrection are God Himself, Christ as life, the divine nature, the law of life, and the anointing of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>From these riches issue two secondary but practical things: the fellowship of life and the sense of life.</S>
