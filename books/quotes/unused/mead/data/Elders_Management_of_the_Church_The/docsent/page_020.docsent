   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING LARGE IN HEART</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As an elder, a person must first have a heart that is large.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Largeness is the first necessary condition of an elder's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Bible, there is one very good ruler, King Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All readers of the Bible admit that he is a standard and a typical character concerning administration in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we want to find a standard character on experiencing the cross, we have to go to David.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But to find a standard character on managing God's people, we have to go to Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Solomon was indeed competent at managing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must remember, however, that King Solomon was competent at managing for two reasons: he had wisdom, and he had a large heart.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Actually, these are two aspects of one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You will recall that Solomon succeeded to the throne when he was very young.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As soon as he succeeded to the throne, he went to offer sacrifices to God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the night, while God appeared to him, Solomon prayed, "And now, O Lord my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in....Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad" 1 Kings 3:7-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He wanted wisdom from God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everyone knows that the most necessary thing in management is wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To have cleverness is not enough, because cleverness is common, whereas wisdom is extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Solomon deeply felt that for a young man to rule the myriads of God's people, he needed wisdom from God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That was why he sought for wisdom before God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Surprisingly, however, though he asked only for wisdom, God gave him, in addition to wisdom, also a large heart.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First Kings 4:29 says, "And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the seashore."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It says that largeness of heart is like the sand on the seashore.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A Chinese proverb speaks of the heart being as large as the capacity of the sea, but here the heart is as large as the sand on the seashore.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The seashore encloses the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Scriptures say that God has "placed the sand for the bound of the sea" Jer 5:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, Solomon's heart was larger than the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the time when God gave Solomon wisdom, He also gave him a large heart.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to know that all wise ones have large hearts, and everyone with a narrow heart is a foolish person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you want to be a foolish person, let me teach you a way: simply make your heart small.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the same principle, if you enlarge your heart, you will become the wisest person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You cannot separate a large heart from wisdom and prudence.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is why I say that these are two aspects of one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Pride is an expression of foolishness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But from where does pride come?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It comes from being narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When a person is narrow and his heart is narrow, it is easy for him to be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is very hard for a person with a large heart to be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For example, we have a young guest living in our house now.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He always boasts to me.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is a typical proud person.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When he puts on a pair of little shoes, he is elated and walks around in a haughty way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, brothers and sisters, a large person would not feel anything concerning a pair of shoes; even if he is given two automobiles, he will not feel anything.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is because such a person is large.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Pride is the expression of the narrowness of a person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Suppose you give a message unusually well one day, and, as a result, you become proud.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This pride proves your narrowness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If your heart is large, even if you have preached very well a thousand times, let alone only once, you would not feel anything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All foolishness proves that a person's heart is narrow, and all pride proves that you are too small.</S>
