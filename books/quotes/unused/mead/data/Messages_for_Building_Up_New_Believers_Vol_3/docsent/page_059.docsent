   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-TWO THE DISCIPLINE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Rom 8:28; Matt 10:29-31; Jer 48:11; Gen 47:7-10</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have believed in the Lord and have received a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But there are many habits which we acquired before we believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many character traits and aspects of our disposition were part of us before we believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Those habits, character traits, and disposition have now become a frustration to the expression of the new life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the reason many people do not touch the new life or experience the Lord when they meet us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Often, others touch our old person.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may be very clever, but our cleverness is an unregenerated cleverness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may be very warm, but that warmth is an unregenerated warmth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may meet someone who is very gentle or very quick, but their gentleness and quickness are unregenerated gentleness and quickness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These old traits frustrate others from touching the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From the day we were saved, the Lord has been doing two things in us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the one hand, He is tearing down our old habits, character, and disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the only way for Christ to express His life freely through us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the Lord does not perform this work, His life will be frustrated by our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the other hand, the Holy Spirit is creating a new nature and a new character in us little by little, with its new living and new habits.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord is not only tearing down the old but also constituting us with the new.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is not only a negative tearing-down work, but also a positive constituting work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These are the two aspects of the Lord s work in us after our we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I. GOD BEING THE ONE WHO DOES THE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After they are saved, many believers realize that their own person needs to be completely torn down.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Yet they are too clever; they try to use artificial means to tear down their old nature, character, and habits.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But the first thing God will tear down is our artificial means.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Brothers and sisters, it is futile and even troublesome to use human energy to try to tear down the very nature, character, and habits which were built up by human energy in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must realize from the very beginning that everything of the past must be torn down.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But we cannot tear it down ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Man s own effort to tear himself down will only result in outward adornment; it will only hinder the growth of the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We do not need to tear ourselves down; God will do it for us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must be clear that it is God who wants to do this and God who does it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We do not have to come up with a way to deal with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God wants us to commit the entire work into His hands.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must be firmly impressed with this fundamental concept.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God will work on us if He is merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God will order an environment that tears down our outward man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God knows how much there is that needs to be destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He also knows our stubborn and strong spots.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We may be too fast, too slow, too loose, or too legal in certain areas.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only God knows our need; no one else knows, not even ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God is the only One who knows us thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must allow Him to do the work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In order to clarify the breaking and constituting work in us, we will use the phrase the discipline of the Holy Spirit for now.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although our whole environment is ordered by God, it is the Holy Spirit who applies this arrangement to us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God arranges the outward environment, but the Holy Spirit translates this arrangement into something inward and applies it to us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This conversion of outward events to inward experience is called the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Indeed, God orders the environment through the Holy Spirit; He does not order our lives directly but rather does so through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The dispensation between the Lord s ascension and His coming again is the dispensation of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In this dispensation all of God s work is carried out through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Holy Spirit arranges everything in the environment and provides inward guidance to God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There are a few passages in the book of Acts which say that the Holy Spirit prompted, stopped, and forbade.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We call the environmental arrangements of the Holy Spirit and the inner prompting, stopping, and forbidding the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This means that the Holy Spirit is disciplining us through all these experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This discipline is not only for our guidance but also for our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It involves not only our ways but also our character.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have a new life within us; the Spirit of God is dwelling in us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He knows what we need, and He knows the kind of experience that will bring us the most benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The discipline of the Holy Spirit is God s ordering of the proper environment through the Holy Spirit in order to meet our need and accomplish His work of breaking and constituting us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thus, the discipline of the Holy Spirit destroys our natural disposition and habits and brings in the constitution of the Holy Spirit in maturity and in sweetness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our environment is altogether arranged by God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Even our hairs are numbered.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If no sparrow falls on the ground without our Father s permission, how much more is our environment under His caring hand?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A harsh word, an unkind gesture, a misfortune, an unfulfilled wish, a sudden loss of health, an abrupt departure of loved ones all these are measured by the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Whether it be happiness, affliction, health, sickness, joy, or pain, everything that comes our way is approved by the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God arranges the environment for the purpose of destroying our old character and disposition and reconstituting us with a new character and disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God arranges the necessary environment for us, and unconsciously, we are broken and the Holy Spirit is constituted into us so that we acquire a character and disposition that resembles God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This God-like character and disposition will be expressed through us day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As soon as we believe in the Lord, we should be clear about a few things: First, we need to be torn down, and then we need to be built up again.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Second, we do not do the tearing-down and building-up work ourselves; God arranges the environment to tear us down and build us up.</S>
