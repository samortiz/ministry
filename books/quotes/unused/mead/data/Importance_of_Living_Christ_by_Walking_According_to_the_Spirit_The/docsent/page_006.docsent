   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ROMANS 8 REVEALING THAT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SPIRIT AS THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION AND APPLICATION OF THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>LIVES IN US SO THAT WE MAY LIVE HIM</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Spirit is not only the Spirit of God but also God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to the original Greek, in terms such as the love of God, the words love and God are in apposition, indicating that God is love.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God s love does not exist independently of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, the term the Spirit of God indicates that the Spirit is God Rom 8:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, John 4:24 says, God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God here is the complete Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The traditional teaching concerning the Trinity implies that only God the Spirit is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, the Bible reveals that the entire Triune God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One of the last titles of the divine person in the Bible is the Spirit Rev 22:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not merely the Spirit who speaks with the bride but the entire Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After passing through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, glorification, and enthronement and having accomplished, attained, and obtained everything necessary for His purpose, the Triune God became the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit John 7:39; 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, the Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As such a Spirit, the Triune God lives in us, and we live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All these matters can be found in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verses 9 and 11 present a threefold Spirit the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the triune Spirit of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because the Spirit enables God to reach and be applied to us, we may also say that the Spirit is the reaching and application of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The current of electricity is electricity itself electricity moving and being applied.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If electricity were not a current, it could not reach or be applied to our homes and businesses.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, the current of electricity is the reaching and application of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Similarly, the Spirit is God Himself moving to reach us and be applied to us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As the reaching and application of the Triune God to us, the Spirit is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This shows the shortcoming of the traditional teachings concerning the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE TRIUNE GOD LIVING IN US</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>AND OUR LIVING HIM ISSUING IN</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A LIFE FULL OF VIRTUES</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>AND MEETING ALL THE NEEDS</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Romans 8 reveals that the Triune God as the Spirit lives in us so that we may live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we live Him, He becomes everything to us: our gospel preaching, our shepherding, and our virtues, such as lowliness, meekness, long-suffering, love, truthfulness, kindness, tenderheartedness, forgiveness, compassion, bearing one another, thankfulness, subjection, and obedience, which are mentioned in Ephesians 4 and Colossians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every virtue in the Bible is the issue of the indwelling God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before I was saved, I wondered if there was a difference between the virtues taught by Confucius and the virtues taught by the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now I know that there is a great difference.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The virtues taught by Confucius are the development of our natural God-created humanity, but the virtues taught in the New Testament are the issue of God living in us and our living God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When God lives in us and we live Him, He comes forth as our virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our patience and humility toward others should be God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although we have known and taught for years that Christ is the reality of every virtue, we need to realize that this is a matter of God living in us and our living Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the focal point of the Bible s teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God s living in us so that we may live Him is a great salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If all the genuine Christians in a region begin to live this way, the entire region will be turned to God without any need for organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When God lives in us and we live, express, and flow out God, many things will come forth, such as gospel preaching, ministering of life, shepherding, edifying, humility, kindness, long-suffering, and oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There will be no opinions, dissension, or any such problems in the churches, for everyone will be directly governed by God as He lives in them and they live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is what God wants.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>NOT BEING DISTRACTED</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>FROM THE TRIUNE GOD LIVING IN US</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>SO THAT WE MAY LIVE HIM</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should not reason in the realm of right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To be right is worth nothing if we are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is better to be living and wrong than right and dead.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church life is not a matter of whether we are right or wrong but a matter of whether we are living ourselves or living God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A brother recently showed me the new building project of a certain local church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, my concern is not primarily in what the saints are doing but in whom they are living.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What matters is not what we are doing but who is living.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we see this, we should not quit our service in the church, for we may still be living ourselves when we quit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We simply need to consider whether we are living ourselves or living God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If the leading brothers see this focus of the Bible and begin to live God, many other saints will be brought into this kind of living, and there will be a wonderful and spontaneous issue.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should not allow anything to be a distraction from the Triune God living in us so that we may live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The primary burden of the elders and co-workers should be to live God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Matthew 7:21-23 says, Not everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Many will say to Me in that day, Lord, Lord, was it not in Your name that we prophesied, and in Your name cast out demons, and in Your name did many works of power?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>And then I will declare to them: I never knew you.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Here the word knew in Greek implies approval.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we do not live God as we are working today, the Lord will not approve our work.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We need to live the Triune God by allowing Him to indwell us, make His home in us, and take full possession of our being and by walking according to the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When we see, appreciate, and practice this, the law of the Spirit of life will operate within us, our mind will spontaneously be set on the things of Christ, and our natural being with its strengths, habits, and practices will spontaneously be put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is Romans 8 the Triune God living in us and our living the Triune God.</S>
