Most Christians can readily understand and accept the first layer, God's gospel and salvation, and the second layer, God's blessing and prosperity. In preaching the gospel, most people tell others that if they believe in Jesus, their sins will be forgiven, and they will enjoy blessing and peace in this life and eternal bliss in the life to come. Most believers remain in the second layer, but God does not want us to remain there.</P><P>After we believe in the Lord, we may experience blessing and peace initially. But gradually, the situation will change. All those who have believed in the Lord can testify that the Lord is indeed with us and is keeping us. But at the same time we also experience many trials, sicknesses, and sufferings. With every blessing there is also some amount of vexation. Without the blessing, there would be no vexation. Having children is a blessing; however, it is also a vexation. Does anyone continually enjoy blessing, prosperity, and peace? If a man desires only blessing without desiring God, in the end all the blessings will become bitter. We must turn from God's blessing and prosperity to God Himself. We are not here for blessing and prosperity, but for God Himself and for His economy and dispensing. Romans 8:28 says, "And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to the purpose." The "all things" here refers to all men, all events, and all matters. It includes the good things as well as the adverse things. It includes the good children as well as the bad children. All things work together for good to those who love God. The "good" here, according to the context, does not refer to physical people, events, or things. Rather, it refers to the increase of Christ within us, with the result that we experience a metabolic change and are conformed, ultimately, to the image of the firstborn Son of God, which is the entrance into the full sonship.</P><P>The first two layers, whether the gospel, salvation, blessing, or prosperity, are superficial. The deepest layer is God Himself, and not merely God alone, but the economy and dispensing of God. The economy of God is His plan and arrangement out of His desire and purpose. The dispensing of God is His dispensing and distributing according to this plan and arrangement.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> </body></html>
