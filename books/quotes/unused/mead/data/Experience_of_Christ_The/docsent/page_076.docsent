   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXPERIENCING RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY SETTING OURSELVES ASIDE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christian teachers have been talking about the Holy Spirit for centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Nevertheless, it is difficult for anyone to define the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to practical experience, not theology, the Holy Spirit is what remains after we put ourselves aside.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Holy Spirit that remains in us is unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sometimes young sisters have told me, "Brother Lee, you have a great deal of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the young sisters have very little of the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It does not matter whether you have much of the Spirit or little.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What matters is that you have Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As long as you have the Spirit, there is no limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, the Spirit may seem limited if we are not willing to put ourselves aside.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A number of times sisters have come to me in tears.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the one hand, I felt sympathetic toward them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But on the other hand, I would not sympathize with them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They were crying because their environment was difficult or even unbearable, but they forgot about the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If they would be willing to put themselves aside, they would not shed so many tears.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, they would immediately be happy in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But if we are not willing to set ourselves aside, take up the cross, and put ourselves under death, the Holy Spirit will seem limited in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sisters, you have a spiritual checking account with unlimited savings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because you have such an account, you can write a check to cover any situation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The way to write a check is to put yourself to death and, through death, to enter into the Spirit as the reality of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whenever you find yourself in a difficult situation, do not weep or pity yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Instead, put yourself aside and keep yourself under the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then spontaneously resurrection will be manifested in you, and you will be able to sing with joy these lines from a hymn by A.B. Simpson:</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>'Tis not hard to die with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When His risen life we know;</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>'Tis not hard to share His suff'rings</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When our hearts with joy o'erflow.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In His resurrection power</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He has come to dwell in me,</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>And my heart is gladly going</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All the way to Calvary.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we set ourselves aside, this will be our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is no need for us to endeavor to go to Calvary.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Rather, we simply need to exercise our will to decide to put ourselves aside.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the circumstances are difficult, do not feel sorry for yourself, but take up the cross and remain under the death of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then you will discover that where death is, there the power of resurrection is also.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Immediately the Spirit, the power of resurrection, will rise up within you, and you will sing with joy, "'Tis not hard to die with Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You will find yourself glad to go all the way to Calvary.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more we go to Calvary, the more of the power of Christ's resurrection will be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The more we know the power of His resurrection, the more we shall be happy to go to Calvary.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is a cycle.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is not a form of suicide; it is an enjoyment of resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We enjoy going to Calvary, and we enjoy the power of Christ's resurrection, the Spirit of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the reality of the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today's Christianity is far away from this mark.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For this reason, we are fighting, not against anyone or against any doctrine, but against religion.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The battle today is between Christ and religion.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord's recovery is a matter of the living Christ, not a doctrinal Christ, a Christ in theory or theology.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Christ who is the reality of the power of resurrection is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord's recovery is for such a Spirit, but Christianity is for religion.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In order to experience Christ, we must go all the way to Calvary.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At Calvary there is a wonderful death, a death that brings in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After we have put the self on the cross, what remains will be the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>With this remainder we shall sense the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the power of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Like A. B. Simpson, we shall go all the way to Calvary, not sorrowfully and with weeping, but joyfully and with singing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We shall enjoy death through the power of resurrection.</S>
