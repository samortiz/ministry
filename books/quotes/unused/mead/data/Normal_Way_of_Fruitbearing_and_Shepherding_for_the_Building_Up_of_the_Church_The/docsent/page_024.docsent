   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IN OUR CHURCH SERVICE, PAYING OUR FULL ATTENTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO THE PRIESTHOOD AND THE BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We all need to be built up as the Body, the priesthood, and the spiritual house.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The building as God s goal is a crucial, significant, clear, and definite matter in the Bible, yet for almost two thousand years the Lord has not fully accomplished His purpose and attained His goal.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Among the many teachings, messages, and sermons in Christianity, almost none of them ever speaks of God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I learned from the teachers in the Brethren assemblies that Christ is the living stone, and we come to Him as living stones, but these teachers did not mention that the stones are for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To hide the New Testament teaching of the building is the subtlety of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today the Lord s ministry cannot neglect the matter of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even in coming to the Gospel of John, we must see the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>John speaks concerning life and building.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In John 1, John the Baptist recommended Christ as the Lamb to take away sin and as the One with the dove to bring God as life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>29, 32-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This attracted five disciples, among whom was Simon, whose name the Lord changed to Peter, meaning a stone vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>41-42 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Later when Jesus met Nathanael, He said, Behold, truly an Israelite, in whom there is no guile! v. 47 . When Nathaniel asked how Jesus knew him, the Lord replied, You shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>48-51 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Jews at that time would have realized that Jesus was referring to Jacob s dream in Genesis 28:11-22.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this dream, Jacob saw a ladder set up on the earth, whose top reached to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When he awoke, Jacob poured oil upon the stone on which he had slept, and he called the name of that place Bethel, which means the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In mentioning this to Nathanael, the Lord s intention was to indicate that as the Son of Man He is the ladder that keeps heaven open to earth and joins earth to heaven for the building of the house of God, Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>John 1 begins by saying, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God...In Him was life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>1, 4a , and it concludes with the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, in John we have life and building.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By all this, Peter received a deep impression.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No doubt, he could never forget how his name was changed to stone.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In eternity we will remember that Peter is stone, and he will remind us all that we too are stones.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, when he wrote his first Epistle, he said that the Lord Jesus is the living stone, and we all are living stones coming to Him to be built up as a spiritual house.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must keep the building of God as our standard.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For almost two thousand years the Lord has not gained His building among the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because of this, Satan can challenge Him and say, Did You not say in Matthew 16:18 that You would build Your church and that the gates of Hades could not prevail against it?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Where then is the builded church?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I have prevailed to frustrate the building.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is a shame to the Lord if we do not have the building among us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, in our church service we must pay our full attention to the priesthood and the building.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must be the priests, and as the priests we must be built up together.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If as thousands of persons we are built up as one man, this will be a shame to the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is against this built-up church that the gates of Hades cannot prevail.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we mean business to have a proper service group, we should go to the Lord to check whether or not we are priests, separated persons, holy and royal with a high standard.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are still on this earth, and most of us have a job in the secular world, teaching or working in an office.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, we must be holy and royal in order to tell out the virtues of the One who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light 1 Pet 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To tell out is to proclaim abroad, to declare, the virtues of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we are not holy and royal, we cannot proclaim abroad the virtues of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are not the proper priests; rather, we are merely common persons on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this case, what we do is not a service; it is only a kind of job or business.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we desire what we do in the church to be a service, we must first be priests.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then we must not serve in a separate way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must be one with others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>DEALING WITH THE SELF</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>AS THE SOURCE OF DISSENTING OPINIONS</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THAT UNDERMINE THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we are not built up, the gates of Hades will prevail against us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If even at this present time there is a lack of building, the enemy will prevail.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is why Satan is subtle to undermine the building through dissent and opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When I hear certain dear ones say, There is no doubt that the Lord is blessing this church, I am prepared for them to continue by saying, but...</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then they will itemize all their dissenting opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They may say that the elders, the brothers, the sisters, and all the children are not good.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The subtle enemy is very clever.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He will often point out things that are true.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, something that is true may cheat us the most.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The enemy uses these things to undermine the building, and when this happens, he is able to prevail against us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To be a holy and royal priest is to be fully separated from the world, and to be built up together is to be fully out of our self.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, we must deal with the world, and we must deal with our self.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The self includes our disposition, thinking, and ways.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we mean business with the Lord to be in the church service, both the world and our self must go.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There is no world and no self in the service.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Any element of the world will cause us not to be the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In order to be priests, everything worldly must be cleared up.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Likewise, in order to be built up, we need to be saved out of our self.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The self must go, including our disposition, our likes and dislikes, our way of thinking, and our way of doing things.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We must learn not to be dissenting, but simply not to be dissenting is insufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The root of dissent is the self, our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There is always something to criticize about others.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Someone may say, I like this brother.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He is a dear saint, but he is a little sloppy.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Look at the way he dresses and the way he speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Even the Lord Jesus often suffered people s criticism.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we were as perfect as the Lord Jesus was, we would still be criticized.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Some who are in the service groups may subconsciously hold a criticizing concept, saying, The church is good, but...</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is according to the fallen disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We all are human, and we all have a disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Only something that is not living has no disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>However, our disposition has been poisoned by the old, cunning, subtle serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Whenever we say, But... in a criticizing way, that is the subtle serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We do not mean that the church is perfect or that everything among us is excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is simply that if we are built up together, we will not speak this kind of criticizing or dissenting word.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We may be positive about the church at first, but soon afterward one of the elders may offend us, or we may be offended when we do not receive something we expected to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Then if we become negative, everything is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Even the way the chairs are arranged is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We may ask, Why are the chairs in a square?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Why are they not in a circle?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>However, even if next time the chairs are arranged in a circle, we may say that the circle is too small or that the seats are too far apart.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>There will always be something to criticize.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This happens simply because we lack the building up.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The building does not depend upon things being perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Until we are fully glorified, there will always be shortages.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>As long as we are still in the old creation, we cannot expect everything to be right.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We cannot expect the leading ones to be perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Neither they nor anyone else has been perfected as precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We are still under the process.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We should all be butterflies, but we are only halfway out of the cocoon.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>No one is perfect yet.</S>
