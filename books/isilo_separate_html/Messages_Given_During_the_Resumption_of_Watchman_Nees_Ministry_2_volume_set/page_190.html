All of this time, eleven out of twelve tribes were kept outside the tabernacle, and only the tribe of Levi was admitted into the tabernacle. This lasted until the New Testament, when Peter said in his first Epistle, "But you are..a royal priesthood" (2:9). Now everyone becomes a servant of God. At the end of the New Testament, in A.D. 95, when John was about to die, he said that we have been made "a kingdom, priests to His God and Father" (Rev. 1:6). God's intention toward the church today is for everyone to be a priest. We are a kingdom of priests. What the Israelites had lost, God is recovering through the church. Through their unfaithfulness, the Israelites lost the priestly kingdom. God's intention today is for every Christian to be recovered to be a priest.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RECOVERY OF THE UNIVERSAL PRIESTHOOD</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>All the Saved Ones Serving God</H2><P>Any service that is not in the nature of a priestly kingdom is wrong. The church has been selected out of the world already. There cannot be a further selection within the church. As long as there is no sin, no fall, and no golden calf, God forbids any further separation. As many as there are who are redeemed by the blood, that many should serve. However many sons there are, that should be the number of servants also. The number of servants should equal the number of sons. Service should include the same number that salvation includes. Today among God's people, there are only backsliding ones; there are no non-slaves or non-maids. There are only rebellious ones; there are no non-serving ones. Any service should be a service by the whole church. This is the Body service that we are talking about in these days. The problem today is that God is not satisfied even when ninety-nine percent of the people are serving. God wants everyone to be serving. We do not believe that a majority of the people should serve, while a minority of the people do not serve. Neither do we believe that a minority of the people should serve, while a majority of the people do not serve. Service is not the work of the ministers, or the work of a few evangelists. Why do we speak so much about the Body service? It is because it is a matter that belongs to all the brothers and sisters.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A Person Needing to Forsake Everything<br>to Serve God As Soon As He Is Saved</H2><P>God's word tells us that we are those who have received God's mercy. But what should we do now? Christianity thinks that a man is first saved through the Lord's blood and by His grace, and then goes on further to forsake the world. As he advances further, he drops everything to serve God. This is degraded Christianity. According to God's word, as soon as a man is saved, and as soon as he steps into the entrance, the Lord tells him to take up the cross (Matt. 16:24). Either a man does not become a disciple, or he has to be one in an absolute way. The Lord sets the price clearly right from the beginning for every saved one. The first day they come, they see the tomb. The first day they come, they are asked to forsake the world. We cannot lower down the gospel, and make the gospel no more the gospel. The Lord never lowers the price to attract customers. The gospel is the least expensive thing there is. Yet at the same time, it is the most costly thing there is. If we are to be saved, we have to be saved in a clear-cut way. Only those who have paid a high price can feel the joy. When the young ruler returned home, his money remained with him, and so did his sorrow (Matt. 19:22). Where money is, there sorrow remains. When money is gone, joy comes along. This kind of salvation requires that a man give up everything totally. Today, many brothers and sisters are sorrowful, just as the young ruler was. They have things in their hands that they cannot drop. The only difference between them and the young ruler is that they have not returned home yet; they are still meeting here. If you want joy, you have to consecrate yourself fully and offer up everything.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_189.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_191.html">Next</a> </body></html>
