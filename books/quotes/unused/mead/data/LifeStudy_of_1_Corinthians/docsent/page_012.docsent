   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Saints Portion</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Colossians 1:12 says, Giving thanks to the Father, Who qualified you for a share of the portion of the saints in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All Christians know that God has redeemed us, but not many realize that He has also qualified us to partake of Christ as the portion of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word portion in Colossians 1:12 indicates enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ is the unique enjoyment for all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Nothing should be allowed to replace Him as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Things such as baptism, speaking in tongues, or healing must not replace Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Only the living Person of Christ, not any doctrine or practice, is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sometimes we say that we enjoy the meetings of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, instead of saying that we enjoy the meetings, we should testify that we enjoy Christ in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is a great difference between enjoying a meeting itself and enjoying Christ in a particular meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Certain saints may boast that the meetings in their locality are better than the meetings elsewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must be very careful concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not say that you enjoy the meetings in your place.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Instead, tell others that you enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not be proud of our locality or any other place.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In a sense, every locality should be lowered down in our estimation so that we may uplift Christ, our unique portion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The unique portion of the saints is not the church in any particular locality.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our unique portion is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>C. The All-inclusive One to Be Our All</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is the all-inclusive One to be our all.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In his Gospel John indicates that Christ is many things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For example, He is the living bread, the door, the Shepherd, and the true vine.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Moreover, in Colossians we see that Christ is not only all-inclusive, but also all-extensive.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But neither in the Gospel of John nor in the Epistle to the Colossians do we have the aspects of Christ which are itemized in 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this Epistle Paul mentions nineteen aspects of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this message we shall simply list them and refer to them briefly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Power</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 1:24 Paul says, But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, God s power and God s wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The crucified Christ preached by Paul is God s power.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This power is for carrying out and accomplishing what God has planned and purposed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Wisdom</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to 1:24, Christ is also God s wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Wisdom is for planning, purposing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In God s economy Christ is both wisdom for planning and power for accomplishing what has been planned.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In 1:30 Paul says that Christ is our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In particular, this righteousness is for our past and enables us to be justified by God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sanctification</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Verse 30 also reveals that Christ is our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is for the present and is related to being sanctified in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to 1:30, Christ is also our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is for the future and is related in particular to the redemption of our body Rom 8:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Glory</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In 2:7 Paul says, But we speak God s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom which has been hidden, which God predestined before the ages for our glory.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christ, the Lord of glory 2:8 , is our life today Col 3:4 and will be our glory in the future Col 1:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To this glory God has called us 1 Pet 5:10 , and into it He will bring us Heb 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the goal of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How marvelous that Christ is our glory for our glorification!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Depths of God</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In 2:10 Paul says, The Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Christ is the depths of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This aspect of Christ is far beyond our experience and apprehension.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It refers to the deep things of God, to Christ in many aspects as our eternal portion.</S>
