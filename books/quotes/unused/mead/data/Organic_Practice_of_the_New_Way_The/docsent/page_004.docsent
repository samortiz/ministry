   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOUR STEPS IN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ORGANIC PRACTICE OF THE NEW WAY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BEGETTING, NOURISHING, TEACHING, AND BUILDING Begetting Gaining People by Knocking on Doors</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The service that God ordains for us in His New Testament economy is first to Go therefore and disciple all the nations Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The meaning of the word go is very extensive.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When you go, surely you have to visit people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After our prolonged study, we have discovered that to visit people by knocking on their doors is the most effective way to carry out the going.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order to take care of the begetting, nourishing, teaching, and building all at the same time, we should not beget too many all at once.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we do, we will not be able to nourish them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is better that we beget only a few and then care for them properly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, we do not need to knock on doors every day.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We do not even need to do that every week, or every month.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For example, there may be five or six brothers and sisters who are burdened to go out.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You should then come together to pray until all the sins in you have been thoroughly dealt with and all of you are full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You can then go out three to a team to preach the gospel by visiting others by knocking on their doors.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you devote one evening a week to do this, after four weeks, you will gain about a dozen people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Dividing these new ones among the three, each will have three or four to care for.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then you should temporarily stop the door knocking and should spend your time to care for these three or four people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you care for them once every two or three days and continue this way for half a year, at least one out of three or four of these new ones will remain.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This one that remains, after having been cared for, nourished, and helped for half a year, will be able to function in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By then, you can begin afresh, three to a team, to go out and knock on more doors.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In another four weeks, you will gain about another dozen new ones, with each one of you caring for three or four.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then you will stop the door knocking again and will care for these new ones for another half a year.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this way, by the end of the year, you will surely have two remaining fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord said, I chose you, and I appointed you that you should go forth and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain John 15:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you would follow this way conscientiously, you will definitely bear two remaining fruit each year.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Moreover, you need to work according to your ability.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do not baptize too many people and leave them there without the proper nourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Also, do not try to go out all at the same time in a big crowd.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Simply take your time to go out, three by three, at your convenience.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to the statistics we received from the Training Center, we should knock more on what we call the warm doors.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everyone has friends and relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You should put the people you know on a list, and you should visit them and preach the gospel to them after careful arrangement and proper telephone appointment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You can also ask the new ones to give you their business cards, with a few words on them to their friends and relatives, explaining that you are a devout Christian desiring to visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After such arrangements, the three of you can set out together.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Nourishing Caring in the Home Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After visiting people, preaching the gospel to them, and bringing them to salvation, you should care for them in the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is like a mother who has just given birth to a baby; she has to nurse the baby.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All the mothers know that it is very easy for a child to die during the first three months after he is born.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The mother must care for the baby carefully and cautiously.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After three months, the condition is more stable.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the same way, after you baptize a person, you should preferably spend one to two hours to nourish and teach him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Within three days, you must go back to him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thereafter, you should visit him on an average of once every three days, or two times a week.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you care for him in this way for a month, his condition will become stable.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To get the best result, the same person should beget, nourish, and care for the new one.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The home meetings are easy to conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But it requires your diligence.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After a person is baptized, immediately you have to help him to call on the Lord so that he would know that he has a spirit and that the Lord is the Spirit and that He is living in him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thereafter, once every three days, you should go back to him and teach him one lesson each time.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For the content of these lessons, you can refer to the ten points that we have mentioned before.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After a month, you should start bringing him to the small group meetings and the district meetings.</S>
