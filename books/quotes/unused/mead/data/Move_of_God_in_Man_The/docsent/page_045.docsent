   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In this message we want to see the move of God in man in our living in the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the resurrection of Christ, God moves in us, and this is God's move in man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The resurrection of Christ is crucially related to us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ's resurrection was not for Himself just as His death was not for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His death and resurrection were altogether for us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If a man has no relation to Christ's death, he is fallen and will perish.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Only the death of Christ saves us from our fall and from eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ not only accomplished an all-inclusive death for us but also completed an all-surpassing resurrection for us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today many saved, regenerated Christians know to some extent how much the death of Christ is related to them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But we need to go further to see how the resurrection of Christ is related to us and how God moves in us in the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A number of Christians know that the Christian life is something related to the Spirit, but few know that the Christian life is related to Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Surely the Christian life is related to the Spirit, but we need to see that the Spirit is the reality of the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Without the Spirit, we cannot have the resurrection of Christ today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God moves in man as the Spirit, and the Spirit is the reality of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's move in man is God's history.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our Christian life today should be a part of God's history in man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If your Christian life is not a part of God's history in man, you are a false Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You are not a genuine, spiritual, divine Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our daily life should be a part of God's history in man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to see that the Christian life is altogether a life in the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should live a life in Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The inner-life people stressed that the Christian life is a crucified life, but the Christian life is not only a life of death but also a life of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are not only terminated persons but also resurrected persons.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Galatians 2:20 says that it is no longer I who live but it is Christ who lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"No longer I" means crucifixion; "but it is Christ who lives in me" means resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If Christ had never resurrected, He could not live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Actually, the inner-life people did not stress adequately the highest peak of the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To speak of the Christian life being a crucified life is like being "three thousand feet above sea level," but to speak of the Christian life being a life in resurrection is like being "six thousand feet above sea level."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Of course, if a person really lives a crucified life, this crucifixion will usher him to the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The goal of Christ's death is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Bible says that Christ died and after three days He resurrected Matt 12:40; 16:21; 1 Cor 15:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These three days were not a full period of seventy-two hours.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to the Jewish calendar, the day begins in the evening at sunset.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Genesis 1 says a number of times that the evening and the morning are one day.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can see the period of time between the Lord's death and His resurrection by considering the final days of His life on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>John 13 tells us that the Lord washed the feet of the disciples just before He established His table.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After He washed their feet, He gave a morsel to Judas and told him, "What you do, do quickly" John 13:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then Judas went to see the chief priests to betray the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After that the Lord gave a long word of three chapters in John 14 16.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This word was concluded by His prayer in John 17.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then He went to the garden of Gethsemane.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When He was there, Judas brought the chief priests, the Pharisees, and the soldiers to arrest Him 18:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the morning the Lord Jesus was sentenced to death by Pilate, and He was brought to Calvary to be crucified there.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He died on the cross at the ninth hour, 3:00 P.M. Matt 27:45-50 . He was buried in a new tomb for a full day and then resurrected early in the morning on the first day of the week 28:1-6 . This shows that the period of time from His death to His resurrection was much less than a full three day, seventy-two hour, period of time.</S>
