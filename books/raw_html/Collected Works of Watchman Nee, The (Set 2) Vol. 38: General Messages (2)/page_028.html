<h2 class="head1">THE ISRAELITES NOT BEING ABLE TO ENTER CANAAN</h2><p>There are a few sobering cases in the Old Testament. In Numbers 13 and 14, God did not allow the Israelites to enter Canaan. Before Kadesh-barnea, the Israelites committed many sins. They often tempted God and often offended Him, but God forgave them. However, after the incident at Kadesh-barnea, God decided that they could not enter Canaan. His decision was firm. Why? When they reached Kadesh-barnea, the Israelites had experienced many miracles already, and they had witnessed that Canaan was a land flowing with milk and honey. However, they believed that the people in the land were too strong and the cities too big. They thought that the sons of Anak were giants and that they themselves were but grasshoppers. They were afraid and wept, and they would not enter the land. Their fear and tears were an insult to God; it affected God Himself. When the Israelites cried and murmured for food and drink, it did not seem that serious. Some sins are caused by human weaknesses, and God is quite forbearing with them. For example, the Israelites craved their favorite food and spoke against God, saying, "Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?" (Psa. 78:19). This did not affect God's attributes, because He knew that they were lustful. He punished them a little and then let them go. However, the incident at Kadesh-barnea did not reflect upon human weaknesses but upon God's power. Being fearful, weeping, and refusing to enter the land were the same as saying that God had brought them to a place of death; it put a question mark on God Himself. When this happened, God could no longer be forbearing. In relation to His government, He could not forgive them. Those who arrived at Kadesh-barnea and refused to go in were not allowed to enter. This was the end; there was no further possibility of repentance. They asked to enter a second time, but God would not relent; He could not relent when His government was concerned. Once His decision was made, it was final. When He said that they could no longer enter, He was firm in the matter because they had offended God Himself. This is the meaning of offending God's testimony.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DESTRUCTION OF THE COMPANY OF KORAH</h2><p>In Numbers 16 and 17 we see the judgment on the company of Korah. They reviled Moses and Aaron, saying that they had gone too far and had exalted themselves above the congregation of Jehovah. God punished the company of Korah; the ground opened its mouth and swallowed them. The next day the congregation of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron, saying that they had killed the people of God, and God's wrath fell upon them also. Later God told Moses to call the leaders of the twelve tribes together and put twelve rods in the tabernacle before the testimony (17:4). The one whose rod budded was the one chosen by God. We can see a great principle in this severe judgment. If men are just arguing about who is the greatest, God will still let them go. John and James argued about who was the greatest, but the ground did not open its mouth to swallow them up. Even at the last supper of the Lord, the disciples were still arguing about who was the greatest, and the ground did not open its mouth to swallow them up then. The consequence was much more serious in Numbers because they had offended God's testimony. The testimony says that only those in resurrection can serve God; dead ones cannot serve God. A man can only serve the Lord in resurrection. Today outside of resurrection, there is no life. In the garden of Eden, we see the tree of life. But today life is in resurrection because death came in. Today life is represented by resurrection. If a man has not entered resurrection, he cannot come before God. Today this life has passed through death. This is why it is called resurrection. Revelation 1:18 is excellent; it says, "And the living One; and I became dead, and behold, I am living forever and ever." Today it is not just a matter of living but a matter of becoming dead and living again. Today our Lord is standing on the ground of resurrection. We also have to stand on the ground of resurrection. Anything that is not standing on the ground of resurrection cannot come before God. Only that which has passed through death and resurrection can stand before God. Many people have not brought their eloquence, thought, ability, power, and wisdom through death; these things are not on the ground of resurrection, and they cannot come before God. In Aaron we see a great testimony&mdash;only one who is in resurrection is qualified to serve God. The budding rod tells us that the only one who has a ministry is the one who is in resurrection. Without resurrection, no one can serve God. This is the testimony! This incident speaks of a principle&mdash;man can only come before God through resurrection. When man was first created, he could come before God freely. But since man fell, he can only come before God through resurrection, because all sinners are dead before God, and no one can come before Him without first going through resurrection. Resurrection is the unique requirement for service today. Of course, this resurrection does not mean the resurrection life that we have received. It refers to the work of the cross in us. The cross was a "taking away" for the Lord Jesus, and it is also a "taking away" for us. When men crucified the Lord Jesus, they cried, "Take Him away! Take Him away!" (John 19:15). Everyone cried to remove Him. The cross is a great removal; all the old creation has to go. If the old creation does not go and the rod does not bud, God's testimony cannot be maintained. In other words, God has only opened one door. Those who do not enter through this unique door are dead. The company of Korah suffered severe judgment because they offended God's testimony. God will allow you to get by with some matters, but He will not allow you to get by with matters that offend His testimony. We must realize that the fundamental reason that God disciplines is to maintain His own testimony. In other words, God does not want to be misunderstood by men. When many people sin, others will only say that the sinners are poor, but not that God is poor. But when a man does certain things, others will say that God is poor; these things affect God Himself. God will not allow you to get by with things that affect God Himself, because these things offend the testimony; they offend God Himself.</p>
