<P>Let us read again Matthew 19:10-12: "His disciples said to Him, If the case of the man with his wife is like this, it is not profitable to marry. And He said to them, Not all men can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given. For there are eunuchs who were born so from their mother's womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs because of the kingdom of the heavens. He who can accept it, let him accept it." If we join the last part of verse 11 to the last part of verse 12, "Only to those to whom it has been given....He who can accept it, let him accept it," it will become clear to us that virginity is given to those who can accept it.</P><P>In order to avoid distraction and have adequate time to serve the Lord with diligence, it is better to remain single. Among the Lord's disciples, John remained single. Later Paul also remained single. But if one needs to be married, he can do so. It is not a sin to marry. The difference between being single and being married has nothing to do with sin. It is a matter of time, diligence, and distraction.</P><P>Marriage is holy, because the body is created by God, as well as all of the needs of the body. This is why marriage is holy. But any demand that man has outside marriage is sin. Why does a man have to be married? It is to avoid having relationships outside marriage. Hence, marriage is not a sin. On the contrary, it prevents sin. Marriage is not a fall. On the contrary, it is instituted to prevent falling.</P><P>Paul made this very clear in 1 Corinthians 7:1-9: "Now concerning the things of which you wrote: It is good for a man not to touch a woman. But because of fornication, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband. Let the husband render to his wife that which is due, and likewise also the wife to the husband. The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does; and likewise the husband also does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. Do not deprive each other, except by agreement for a time that you may devote yourselves to prayer, and then be together again, that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. But this I say by way of concession, not by way of command. Yet I wish all men to be even as I am myself; but each has his own gift from God, one in this way, the other in that. But I say to the unmarried and to the widows, It is good for them if they remain even as I am. But if they do not have self-control, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn with desire." This passage shows us that one reason for marriage is to prevent fornication. At the same time, it points out that God has given some the special gift of remaining single. But it is better for those who have not received this gift to marry in order to avoid falling into fornication.</P>
