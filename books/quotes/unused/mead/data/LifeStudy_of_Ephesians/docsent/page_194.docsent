   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Revealing the Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Furthermore, the book of Ephesians reveals the Triune God more fully than any other book in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians 1:3 says, Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This verse speaks of God the Father and Christ the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Spirit is not explicitly mentioned; however, the Spirit is implied in the spiritual blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These blessings are blessings of the Spirit and in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, in one verse we have the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 2:18 it says that through Him, the Son, we have access in one Spirit unto the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here again we have in one verse the Triune God, the Son, the Spirit, and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Through the Son and in the Spirit we have access to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the experience of the Triune God for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In chapter three we also see the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul prayed to the Father to grant us to be strengthened through His Spirit into the inner man so that Christ may make His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Here we have the Father, the Spirit, and Christ the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually, according to verse 19, we are filled unto all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, we have the Spirit strengthening us and Christ making His home in us; then we are filled unto the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Such a revelation of the Triune God is not found elsewhere in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 4:4-6 we also find the Triune God: the Spirit v. 4 , the Lord v. 5 , and God the Father v. 6 . The sequence here is significant.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Firstly we have the Spirit, then the Son, and then the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the Body life, the first Person of the Godhead we touch is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we touch the Spirit, we touch the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then, by having the Son, we have the Father who is the origin and source of all.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the flow in the course.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we touch the flow, we are in the course, and when we are in the course, we are brought to the source.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Here we have the reality of the one Body with the one Spirit, the one Lord, and the one God and Father.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The reason that Ephesians unfolds the Triune God to such a degree is that this book is on the church, the entity composed through the dispensing of the Triune God into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church comes into being only as the Triune God dispenses Himself into us and mingles Himself with us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Ephesians we have not only the doctrine of the Trinity, but the practicality of the Trinity for the dispensing of God into man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Triune God is not for teaching, but for imparting Himself into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>CHRIST MAKING HIS HOME IN OUR HEARTS</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have pointed out that, as the processed God, the Triune God today is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As the Spirit, He can dispense Himself into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This makes it possible for us to be filled in our spirit unto all the fullness of God and for Christ to make His home in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ is not simply dwelling within us, but is seeking the opportunity to make His home in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is to mingle Himself with every part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ, the Son of God and the very embodiment of God, is the life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit to spread into all of our inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The result of this is not only holiness, spirituality, and victory, but the marvelous mingling of divinity with humanity to produce the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE BODY AND THE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The church that is produced by the mingling of divinity with humanity is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Certain Christian teachers think that the Body of Christ is merely an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But this is not just an illustration it is the very expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Just as my physical body is the expression of myself, so Christ s spiritual Body is the expression of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, the church as the Body of Christ is a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Furthermore, the church is the new man with Christ as the life and the person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A body must have life, but a man must have both life and a person.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Trees have life, but they do not have a person with a mind, will, and emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Since the church is the Body and the new man, the church has Christ as both the life and the person.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This understanding of the church is basic.</S>
