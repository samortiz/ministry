   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-NINE ACCORDING TO THE PATTERN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOD HAS SHOWN ON THE MOUNT Scripture Reading: Heb 8:5; Psa 19:13 ONE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The most important thing in our spiritual work is a knowledge of the "pattern on the mount."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In our spiritual work, many things are important, and if we come short in any of them, our work will lose its spiritual usefulness and not please God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Of these important items, the most crucial one is "the pattern on the mount."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The pattern on the mount is God's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we do not understand God's plan, it will be impossible for us to do God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The book of Hebrews tells us that the tabernacle was made according to God's revealed pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before Moses built the tabernacle, he remained on the mountain forty days and nights, in order to give God time to show him the pattern and method of construction for the heavenly tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There were prescribed patterns for everything from the Holy Place to the altar, including the material and color of each layer of the tabernacle's covering.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Nothing was left to random design; there were prescribed plans and standards for everything.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The altar, laver, table, lampstand, incense altar, ark, and everything else were made according to God's prescribed pattern, which even specified the kind of metal or wood to be used and their measurements and colors.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Nothing was left to Moses' design.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's building of the church is the same as His building of the tabernacle; He works according to a prescribed plan.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No matter how great or how small a matter is, God has an ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Moses was not responsible for the design of the pattern of the tabernacle; he was only responsible for carrying out the pattern according to instructions he received on the mount.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The glory of a servant of Christ does not lie in his ability to come up with new designs for God but in his faithfulness in carrying out the will of God as he understands it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Understanding God's plan and working according to His plan are the glory of a servant of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A sister who has been serving the Lord for many years once said that man does not have any liberty at all in the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When Moses built the tabernacle, he did not have the liberty to determine whether gold or silver should be used for even the smallest nail; everything had to be done according to God's instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Moses was a meek person Num 12:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What does it mean to be meek?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It means to be pliable and yielding.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He did what God wanted him to do.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God prescribed the materials, colors, designs, and measurements, and Moses carried out the work according to God's instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He did everything according to God's command and did nothing according to his own will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This was Moses' meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Moses' building of the tabernacle gives us much spiritual light.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It shows us the proper standing of a servant of God in spiritual work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God prescribed everything concerning the tabernacle; He did not leave one single feature or small detail for Moses to design.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God did not allow Moses to propose anything.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He told Moses not only the general features of the tabernacle but the details as well.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Not only were the patterns, materials, colors, and measurements of every item determined by God, but even the way they were to be made was determined by God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It was not enough for Moses to make them according to God's prescribed measurements and pattern; he even had to make them according to God's prescribed procedure.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For example, the veils had to be made not only of fine linen but of fine linen that was twined.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The lampstand had to be made not only of gold but of one piece of gold of beaten work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God did not leave any room for Moses to make any proposals.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He knew what He wanted.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He did not need man to be His counselor, and He would not allow His servants to follow their own ideas in carrying out His work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The greatest blessing a servant of Christ can possibly have is to receive God's instruction on the mount, to know the kind of work God has assigned for him, and to know the prescribed pattern concerning the work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Servants of Christ, are you coming to God to ask for your assigned work?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Are you coming to God for His instruction as to the time and method of your work?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Or are you conducting your work according to human reasonings, plans, schemes, and decisions?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many people think that God has no detailed prescriptions concerning His work and that many things are left to their own design.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They have not seen that they are but a servant in God's work, and they can only do as they are told.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They forget the words: "Whatever He says to you, do" John 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They forget that they are but a member in the Body of Christ and that they have to hold the Head Col 2:19 and be under the direct control of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They presume that God needs their fleshly life and natural strength to fill up the lack of His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>May God show us that Christ is the absolute Master in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Everything related to God's work must first pass His authorization.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The power of Christ's servants and the fruitfulness in their spiritual service can only be secured and manifested through singleness in pursuit of God's will and adherence to His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Otherwise, a worker's work may appear exciting, and the outward accomplishments may be great, but before the judgment seat of the Lord, all of these works will be shown by the trying fire to be nothing but wood, grass, and stubble.</S>
