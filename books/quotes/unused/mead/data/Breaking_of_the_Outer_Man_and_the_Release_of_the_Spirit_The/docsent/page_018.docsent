   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR HOW TO KNOW MEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is crucial for a worker of the Lord to be able to know men.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When a person comes to us, we have to know his spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have to know what kind of person he was and what he has now become.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have to know what he is saying with his mouth and what he is really saying in his heart, and what is the difference between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to know what he is trying to hide from us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have to know his outstanding characteristics, whether he is stubborn or humble, and whether his humility is real or artificial.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The effectiveness of our work very much depends on our ability to discern the spiritual condition of others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the Spirit of God shows our spirit the condition of those who come to us, we will be able to give them a suitable word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whenever men came to the Lord in the Gospels, He spoke a suitable word to them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is amazing!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord did not speak to the Samaritan woman about the truth of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Neither did He speak to Nicodemus about the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The word on regeneration was for Nicodemus, and the word on the living water was for the Samaritan woman.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How fitting!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To those who had never followed Him, He issued a calling.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To those who wanted to follow Him, He spoke of bearing the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To those who volunteered, He spoke of counting the cost.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To those who were hesitant to follow, He spoke of letting the dead bury the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord has a suitable word for everyone, because He knows everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whether a person comes to the Lord with a seeking heart or a prying attitude, our Lord knows him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the reason His word is forever effective and suitable.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our Lord is far ahead of us in dealing with men.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are following Him only from a distance.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although we are following at a distance, we still have to follow; the direction has to be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>May the Lord be merciful to us so that we may learn to know men as He does.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we place a soul in the hand of a brother who has no discernment of men, he will not know how to deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He will only speak according to his subjectivity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If he has a certain feeling on a certain day, he will speak of this feeling to whomever he meets.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If he has a favorite subject, he will speak to everyone about that subject.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How can such a person do an effective work?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No doctor can prescribe only one kind of medicine to all of his patients.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Unfortunately, some servants of God have only one prescription.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They do not understand others' illnesses, yet they try to heal them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They do not know the problem, they do not know the complexity of men, and they have never learned to know the spiritual condition of others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Nevertheless, they act as if they have a ready treatment for everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is indeed foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We cannot expect to heal every spiritual sickness with just one spiritual prescription.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is absolutely impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should not think that those who are slow in feeling will have a difficult time discerning men, but that those who are sharp in mind will have an easy time discerning men.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Neither slowness in feeling nor sharpness of mind have anything to do with discerning men.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We cannot discern men with our mind or our feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>No matter how sharp our mind is, we cannot bring the hidden things in man to light, nor can we touch the depth of man's condition.</S>
