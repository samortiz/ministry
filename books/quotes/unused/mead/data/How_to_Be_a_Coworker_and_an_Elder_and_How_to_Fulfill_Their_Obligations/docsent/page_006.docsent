   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. In His Divinity He Is Carrying Out His Organic Salvation in His Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Fourth, we also need to know that in His divinity Christ is carrying out His organic salvation in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to see further that Christ's redemption is different from His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Romans 5:10a says that we "were reconciled to God through the death of His Son"; this refers to His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Romans 5:10b says, "Much more we will be saved in His life"; this refers to His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The organic salvation is being carried out in resurrection by Christ in His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is new light and the new language given to us by God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In His divinity and in His resurrection, He is carrying out His organic salvation in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The judicial redemption has been accomplished, but the organic salvation is being carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to have a clear knowledge concerning these four items.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then whether we are co-workers or elders, when we go to shepherd and teach people, we can speak these things to them in a very clear way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The co-workers and elders need to know Christ particularly in these four main items.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You must not despise these four items.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You may think that you already know these things, but when you go to speak to others, you may not know how to do it or how to call their attention to the main points.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This requires practice.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The churches in Taiwan are presently practicing four things: praying, studying, reciting, and speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every co-worker and elder must deal with these four items concerning Christ by pray-reading over them, studying them deeply, reciting them from memory, and speaking them thoroughly to present clearly the main points to others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>TO EXPERIENCE AND ENJOY CHRIST TO GAIN CHRIST IN HIS FULL MINISTRY IN HIS THREE DIVINE AND MYSTICAL STAGES</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To be a co-worker or an elder, we also need to experience and enjoy Christ to gain Christ Phil 3:8 in His full ministry in His three divine and mystical stages.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How can we be a co-worker and an elder?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>First, we need to know Christ; second, we need to experience and enjoy Christ, that is, to gain Christ, in His full ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First, we have the knowledge, and then we have the experience and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To experience and enjoy Christ is to gain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Philippians 3:8 Paul said, "...Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as refuse that I may gain Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To "have" is not sufficient; we need to "gain."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To gain Christ requires paying a price.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To gain Christ is to experience, enjoy, and take possession of all His unsearchable riches by paying a price.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is not so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, Paul went on to say, "Not that I have already obtained or am already perfected, but I pursue....I do not account of myself to have laid hold; but one thing I do: Forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before, I pursue toward the goal" vv.12-14a .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is not easy to win a game, and it is also not easy to win the victory in a war.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These require us to pursue by forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Likewise, we need to gain Christ by experiencing and enjoying Him in His full ministry.</S>
