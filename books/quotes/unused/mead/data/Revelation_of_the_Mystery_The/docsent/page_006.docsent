   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST BECOMING US AND WE BECOMING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Finally, since Christ is all, Christ must be the real me.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let me ask you, "Is Christ you?"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You must say, "Yes, Christ is me because Christ is all, and I am included in all!"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I am not something negative.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As a human being, I am something positive, so Christ is surely the real me.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thank and praise the Lord that Christ is the real us!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Him we see God, and in Him we also see ourselves!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do you have the boldness to say that Christ is the real you?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The last two lines of stanza 4 of Hymn #130 in the Chinese hymnal say, "Thou became me, and I became Thee: / 'Tis Thy love to the uttermost!"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since the first part of that line says, "Thou became me," it naturally follows that the second part should say, "I became Thee."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some have opposed this, saying, "To say that Christ became us may be all right because Christ became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, if we say that we have become Christ, that means that we have become God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Is this not blasphemy?"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I do not know what kind of mind those opposing people have.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Would it not be ridiculous for someone to say that four plus four equals eight but that eight does not equal four plus four?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Bible says that we are members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Suppose I said, "This arm is a member of this brother, but it is not this brother himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, when I hit this member, I am not hitting this brother himself."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This kind of logic does not make any sense.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have all become members of Christ, so how can we not be Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Not only so, 1 Corinthians 12 says explicitly that the Body is Christ: "For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ" v. 12 . The Christ here is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, to say "Thou became me, and I became Thee" is not heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, the Lord Jesus said that He is the vine and that we are the branches John 15:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The branches are included in the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may even say that the branches are the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the wonder of wonders and the mystery of mysteries that Christ is all.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we all would know Christ to such an extent, how noble we would be!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ is me, and I am Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is Christ in me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Is God in the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then who is God?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Is Jehovah in the Scriptures?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then who is Jehovah?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Jehovah is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Is the Father in the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then who is the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Father is Christ Isa 9:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Is the Son in the Scriptures?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then who is the Son?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Son is Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Is the Spirit in the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then who is the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Spirit is Christ 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Is man in the Scriptures?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then who is the real man?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The real man is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Are you in the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then who is the real you?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The real you is Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christ is all.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Christ is not only all in the new man but also all in the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must see that Christ is our life, our virtues, and our all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Where is He?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What is He in our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He is the Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This Christ who has become our all is in our spirit as the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Today, we live by Christ when we live by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When we live by Him, we allow Him to live Himself through us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When He lives Himself out of us, then it is possible for us to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we seek the Lord, sooner or later He will open our eyes to see that as the Christ of all, He is all.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He is not only the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, He is also the reality of all positive things.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We must see the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The greatest mystery in the universe is that He can become us and we can become Him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As the all-inclusive Spirit He enters into our regenerated spirit to be joined and mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The two spirits His Spirit and our spirit became one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He lives instead of us, and we live by Him Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Therefore, what we live out is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>For to us, to live is Christ Phil 1:21 .</S>
