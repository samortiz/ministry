<h2 class="head1">NEWS OF THE CHURCHES</h2><h2 class="head2">Hankow, Hupeh Province</h2><p>I experienced the Lord's unmatched grace when I stayed in Hankow. I can only rest in Him. Testifying of the living and evident care and protection of the Lord's grace upon His children would take a whole book. We can only praise Him by saying that His lovingkindness endures forever, and His faithfulness abides throughout the generations. Brother Ju Yao-ju and his whole family are living safely in Chi-Li. Mrs. Hu and her children have arrived in Chungking, and Brother Hu can still draw his regular salary on a monthly basis. The house and the furnishings in Gospel Lane are still intact. Praise the Lord! I am now lodging in the refugee district and daily living in the grace of God. Other than serving the refugees and working in the office, the rest of my time is partly spent testifying for the Lord and learning to pray. Please pray, supplicate, and offer thanksgivings for us.</p><p>A weak member in the Lord,<br />Lan Tsi-yi, January 26</p><h2 class="head2">Ch'ang-sha, Hunan Province</h2><p>I arrived safely in Ch'ang-sha on February 1. I waited on the Lord for over a month concerning going to Ch'ang-sha, before setting out to come. En route to Ch'ang-sha, I passed through Yi-Yang. Four or five days prior to my arrival, Brother Yang Dai and Sisters Chiu and Tso came to the city from the villages. I was able to meet with them. I found out from them that the Lord has done a wonderful work in the villages around Yi-Yang. In Yang-Jia-Wan, which is about a mile from Yi-Yang, Sisters Chiu and Tso led the relatives of one sister and her whole family to the Lord. There are over ten people in the family, and all of them have believed. In Ho-Jia-Ho, which is five miles from Yi-Yang, a certain believer, Mrs. Chang, was not too clear about salvation. The Lord used Sister Chiu to help her accept full salvation and to heal an epileptic woman through prayer. A few repented and believed in the Lord because of this. In She-Jia-Jou, which is about seven or eight miles away, there are over ten families of Methodist believers. But most of them do not know the Lord. Sister Chiu has a distant relative who went there to escape the war, through whom she has been able to communicate with these believers. The believers are mostly illiterate farmers. But they have a hunger for the Lord, and they always ask Sisters Chiu and Tso to come and help them. Because these three places need the leadership of brothers, Sister Chiu wrote to Brother Yang and asked him to pray and then perhaps to go there and work. Brother Yang was not clear concerning going to Ch'ang-sha. He first went to Yang-Jia-Wan to preach the gospel for a few days. He did not go to the other two places because of rain. When I showed up without invitation, Sister Chiu implored me to stay for a few more days and visit the remaining two places with Brother Yang. After praying about it, I felt burdened within. On the thirteenth I walked to Ho-Jia-Ho and preached the gospel for three days. On the fifteenth I took the boat to She-Jia-Jou. The Lord led us in a spirit of oneness to have two days of perfecting meetings. Mrs. Chang came and about twenty believers gathered together, even though it was close to the Chinese New Year. We had a meeting every day in the morning and in the evening. I spoke on the subject of God's purpose in creating man. Every meeting lasted for one to two hours. The audience was very attentive and not tired at all. Thank the Lord for the work! I thank Him even more for the growth of life in the brothers and sisters. Sister Tso Teh-jen rejoiced in suffering and often traveled around the countryside with the elderly Sister Chiu. They are also diligently teaching the old believers and the children to read and study the Bible.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Liu Ai-wu, February 23</p><h2 class="head2">Shu County, Anhwei Province</h2><p>Hwang-Jia-Juan had a fire. I intend to go and take a look in the near future because I heard that all the houses in that village were burned. Only Brother Huang Si-shin's (the responsible brother's) house remained. Thank the Lord. We heard that all his furnishings were burned and that the red potatoes in his cellar were not damaged. Last fall there was an exceptional harvest of red potatoes, which were kept in the cellar. These potatoes can last until next spring. Every Lord's Day they meet and worship the Lord at Pu-Zi, Shi-Wu-Li. The meeting at Pu-Zi, Shi-Wu-Li is in the house of Brother Lu Jen-wu, who has a household of over twenty people, a few of whom are already participating in the Lord's table. Their whole family is very hospitable. Our beloved Lord has blessed the meeting there as well as Brother Lu's household. The meeting in Pai-Ma-Chun is as usual. My whole family is in the Lord's grace. My daughter's tuberculosis is not healed yet, but there is no fever even though she has been coughing quite heavily recently. Please pray for this.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Huang Tze-hou, February 25</p>
