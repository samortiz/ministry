   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Example Four</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us consider the matter of worship again.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John 4 tells us that "God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness" v. 24 . We have pointed out previously that the word "truthfulness" can be translated as "reality." The emphasis is the spirit, but it also mentions reality.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Those who worship God must worship with their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Anything that is of the spirit is real, and anything that is not of the spirit is not real.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One does not worship God by the emotions, the feelings, or the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To worship God, one must be in spirit and in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Otherwise, one cannot touch spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What is reality?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the spirit touches God, there is reality; when the spirit does not touch God, there is no reality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Anything that is of the spirit is real, and anything that is not of the spirit is not real.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Formalistic worship is, of course, not up to the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the so-called spiritual worship is, at times, unworthy of an amen.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One may not be able to put his finger on the problem, but there is a feeling that it is not the real thing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then there are those who are truly worshipping God; they may not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However you can say amen, because you have touched something real in them; you have touched the reality in them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Example Five</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thanksgiving and praise are good things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But many thanksgivings and praises are ritualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They are not what the Bible describes as reality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Brothers and sisters, have you had the experience in which someone was thanking and praising but there was not an amen within you?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In fact, you felt quite cold within.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It seemed that the more the person praised, the colder you became.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sometimes a person encounters a problem, and he continues to thank and praise the Lord in a loud way, acting as if there is no problem at all.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Is this good?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It seems good.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But the more he praises and thanks the Lord, the more you cannot say amen.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You do not understand why.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But something within you says, "It is good to thank and praise the Lord, but this kind of thanksgiving and praise is not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is not the reality."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some people seem to be unconcerned about their problems; they fill their mouths with joyful and happy thanksgivings and praises.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But within, you feel that there is something wrong, that it is not right, and that it is not the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You may meet another brother who is not as loud as the first one in thanking and praising the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He may not appear as joyful and may, in fact, show some sadness in his face.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But the strange thing is that when he thanks and praises the Lord in a soft way, you can say amen.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You feel that it is right, that it is the real thing, and that he has touched the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Example Six</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Take prayer as another example.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I will not mention formalistic prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Seemingly zealous prayers and long prayers often do not strike an amen in others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the contrary, the more these prayers are offered, the more others become cold.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is because the prayer has not touched any spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Luke 18 speaks of two persons praying in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The prayer of the tax collector who "beat his breast, saying, God, be propitiated to me, the sinner!" v. 13 touched others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But the prayer of the self-justifying Pharisee who praised God loudly did not touch others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is because one was praying to God, while the other was only praying "to himself" v. 11 . Many prayers that are prayers to oneself do not strike any amen.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On the contrary, they make others sick.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A real prayer may be short in words and may even be inarticulate, but when one prays such a prayer, he touches reality.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He touches the depth of others' beings, and others can respond with a spontaneous amen.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Example Seven</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Another matter is the blood of the Lord Jesus cleansing our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Physically speaking, this is an impossible thing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, could anyone take the blood which was shed and sprinkle it on himself to cleanse his conscience?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>No. The Holy Spirit is the Executor of all spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When the Holy Spirit cleanses our conscience with the Lord's blood, He is cleansing us with the spiritual reality of the blood rather than the physical blood.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Something is real only when it is in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we touch the reality in the Holy Spirit, we touch life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But if all we touch are doctrines, the result is death, and we will not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Example Eight</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Romans 6 says that our old man has been crucified with Christ v. 6 . This is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Some Christians say, "I know that my old man is crucified, but I do not know why my old man is still living today."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The reason for this is that they have touched a doctrine; they have not touched the spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must realize that if a doctrine is in letters and not in the Holy Spirit, we will not receive any life even if we know all about it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we merely touch the doctrines of salvation, justification, and sanctification, what we have are merely letters, and they are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A doctrine must be in the Holy Spirit before it can become a spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When we touch the spiritual reality, we touch life, and it is living and fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A person may seemingly deliver a very spiritual sermon.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Yet what he says stifles others because he has not said the real thing itself.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When a man touches reality, what he says will be real.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is reality that causes others to touch reality.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Otherwise, even if there are extensive quotations and references, and even if all the logic is right, those who know reality will still say that it is not reality.</S>
