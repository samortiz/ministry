   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT USING AN OUTER MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THAT IS BROKEN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As soon as our outer man is bound, our spirit becomes bound as well.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The spirit cannot bypass the outer man to operate in others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God never bypasses man's spirit when His Spirit works in man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Nor does God allow our spirit to bypass our outer man when it operates in others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a very important principle, and we must be clear about it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Holy Spirit never works on man apart from man, and our spirit can never work on man apart from our outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our spirit must pass through our outer man before it can operate in others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whenever our outer man is occupied by "things in the hands" and has exhausted its strength, we cannot participate in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If our spirit does not have a way to go on, the Holy Spirit does not have a way to go on either.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The outer man can block the way of the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The outer man can frustrate the inner man and prevent it from coming out.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the reason that we repeatedly emphasize the breaking of the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once the outer man has things in its hands, the inner man has no way to break out, and God's work is frustrated.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Things in the hands refer to things which are present before God's work comes into view.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In other words, things in the hands are things that are unrelated to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These things are perpetuated without God's command, power, or ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They are not under God's hand; rather, they are independent entities.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God has to break the outer man before He can use the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He has to break our love before He can use our love to love the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the outer man is not broken, we are still doing our own things, taking our own way, and loving our own preferences.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God must first break our outer man before He can use our "broken" love to love the brothers and before our love can be expanded.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once the outer man is broken, the inner man is released.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The inner man must love, but it must love through the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the outer man has things in its hands, the inner man will have nothing to work through.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our will is strong.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is not only strong; it is also stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When our inner man needs the will, it cannot find it, because our will has been moving too independently and has too many things in its hands.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God has to give us a heavy blow; He has to smash our will and humble us so much that we are forced to say, with our face in the dust, "Lord, I dare not think.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I dare not ask.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I dare not decide.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I need You in everything."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must be so smitten that our will can no longer act independently.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only then can the inner man take hold of the will and use it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the outer man is not available, the inner man will be unemployed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Can we preach God's word if we do not have a physical body?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How can we preach without a mouth?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is true that one needs the spirit to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But preaching also requires one's mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What can a person do if he only has a spirit but not a mouth?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At Pentecost there was the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But at Pentecost there was also the dispensing of the gift of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Without utterance one does not have the word to release and explain God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If man does not speak, God has no speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Man's word certainly is not God's word, but God's word is conveyed through man's word.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If man does not speak, there will be no word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There must be man's word before there can be God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Suppose a brother is preparing to speak God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He may have the word and a burden in his spirit, and the burden may be very heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But if he does not have the suitable thoughts, his burden can never be released.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the end even his burden will disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We do not despise the burden, but even if our entire spirit is full of burden, this burden is useless and bound up if our mind is not fruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We cannot save men with our burden alone.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The burden in our spirit must be released through our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After we have a burden within us, we still need a mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We still need a voice and the help of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The trouble today is that while our inner man is available to receive a burden from God, the mind in our outer man is too busy and confused.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>From morning to night it is giving its own suggestions and expressing its own opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Under such circumstances, the spirit does not have an outlet.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Today God's Spirit must be released through man.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Man's love must be available before others can see God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Man's thoughts must be available before others can see God's thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Man's decision must be found before others can touch God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But the trouble with man is that his outer man is too busy with his own things.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He has his own views, his own thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He is too busy with himself.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As a result, the inner man has no way to be released.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is the reason God has to break the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This does not mean that the will has to be annihilated.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>However, it does mean that the "things in the hands," that is, in the will, have to be stripped so that the will no longer acts independently.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It does not mean that our thoughts have to be annihilated.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It means that we will no longer think according to ourselves, that we will no longer come up with all kinds of ideas or be led astray by our own wandering mind.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It does not mean that our emotion is annihilated.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It means that our emotion will be under the control and direction of the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In this way the inner man will find a mind, an emotion, and a will that are available for use.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The spirit needs a mind, an emotion, and a will to express itself.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It needs a living outer man, not a dead one, to express itself.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It needs a smitten, wounded, and broken outer man, not a sealed and untouched outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Today the biggest obstacle is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>God's Spirit cannot break through us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>His Spirit lives in our spirit, yet He cannot come out of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Our outer man is too full; it is full of things in its hands.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We have to ask God for mercy so that the outer man will be broken and the inner man will have a way to come out.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>God does not destroy our outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But neither will He allow it to remain intact and unbroken.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He wants to pass through our outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>He wants our spirit to love, think, and make decisions through the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>God's work can only be accomplished through a broken outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If we want to serve God, we have to pass through this basic dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If our outer man is not broken, the Lord will not be able to have a way through us.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He has to break through our outer man before He can reach others.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Before the outer man is broken, the inner man and the outer man stand in opposition to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The inner man is a complete person, and the outer man is also a complete person.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The outer man is complete and independent; it is free and full of things in the hands.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Meanwhile, the inner man is imprisoned.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>After the outer man is genuinely broken, it no longer acts independently.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>It is not destroyed, but it no longer stands in opposition to the inner man; it is subject to the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>In this way there will be only one person left in us.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The outer man will be broken into pieces and ready for the inner man's use.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Those whose outer man has been broken are "unified" men.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Their outer man is under the control of the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>An unsaved person is also a "unified" man, but the roles of his two men are reversed: His inner man is controlled by his outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>An unsaved person has a spirit, but his outer man is so strong that his inner man is completely subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>At the most the inner man can voice some protest in the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The inner man of an unsaved person is completely defeated and dominated by the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>After a man is saved, he should turn everything around.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The outer man should be completely crushed and be fully under the control of the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Just as an unsaved person finds his outer man dominating his inner man, we should turn things around and allow the inner man to take control of the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>In riding a bicycle a person can be in one of two conditions: Either the wheels work on the road or the road works on the wheels.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>On flat terrain, the legs peddle the wheels and the wheels work on the road.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>On a downward slope, the legs do not have to work.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>The wheels roll by themselves, and in this case, the road, that is, the slope, works on the wheels.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>When our inner man is strong and the outer man is broken, the wheels work on the road; that is, we decide when and how fast we want to move.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>But if the outer man is stubborn and unbroken, it is like riding a bicycle downhill; the slope works on the wheels.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>The wheels will roll by themselves, and we can do nothing about it.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>This is what happens when the outer man controls the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Whether or not a man is useful before the Lord depends on whether his spirit can be released through his outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>When our inner man is bound, the outer man does everything by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>The outer man acts independently; the wheels turn by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>By the Lord's grace, when He levels the slopes and breaks the outer man, the outer man no longer offers suggestions and makes decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>When this happens, the inner man will be released freely without any hindrance from the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>If the Lord grants us the grace and breaks our outer man, we will become a person adept at exercising our spirit, and we will be able to release it whenever we want to.</S>
