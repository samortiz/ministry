   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRAYER Scripture Reading: John 16:24; James 4:2-3; Luke 11:9-10; Psa 66:18; Mark 11:24; Luke 18:1-8 I. PRAYER BEING A BASIC CHRISTIAN RIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christians have a basic right while living on earth today, the right to receive answers to prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The moment a person is regenerated, God gives him the basic right to ask of Him and to be heard by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>John 16 says that God answers when we ask in the name of the Lord so that our joy may be made full.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we pray without ceasing, we will live a Christian life that is full of joy on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we unceasingly pray, yet God does not unceasingly answer our prayer, or if we have been a Christian for years and God hardly or never listens to our prayers, there must be something seriously wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we have been a Christian for three to five years without receiving one answer to prayer, we are ineffectual Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are not just a little ineffectual, but very ineffectual.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are children of God, yet our prayers are never answered!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This should never be.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every Christian should experience God answering his prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every Christian should have frequent experiences of prayers being answered.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a basic experience.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If God has not answered our prayers for a long time, it means that there is surely something wrong with us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is no way to deceive ourselves in the matter of answers to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If it is answered, it is answered.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If it is not answered, it is not answered.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If it is effectual, it is effectual.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If it is ineffectual, it is ineffectual.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We would like to ask every Christian: Have you learned to pray?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Has God answered your prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is wrong for prayers to be left unanswered, because prayers are not just a speaking into the air.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Prayers are meant to be answered.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Unanswered prayers are vain prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christians must learn to have answered prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since you have believed in God, your prayers should be answered by God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Your prayers are useless if God does not answer them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You must pray until your prayers are answered.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Prayer is not only for spiritual cultivation but even more for receiving answers from God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Prayer is not that easy a lesson to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A person may be a Christian for thirty or even fifty years and yet not learn to pray well.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the one hand, prayer is not a simple thing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the other hand, prayer is so easy that a person can pray as soon as he believes in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Prayer can be considered the most profound as well as the simplest subject.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is so profound that some still cannot pray well despite learning about it all their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many children of God feel that they do not know how to pray even up to the time they die.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, prayer is so simple that the moment a person believes in the Lord, he can start praying and have his prayers answered.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you begin your Christian life in a good way, you will always receive answers to your prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you do not have a good start, you may not have an answer to prayer for three or even five years.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you do not have a proper foundation, you will need much effort to correct it later.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, once a person believes in the Lord, he must learn to receive answers from God for his prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We hope that every believer will pay attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>CONDITIONS FOR PRAYERS BEING ANSWERED</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the Bible we can see many conditions for having prayers answered, but only a few of them are basic.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We believe that if we meet these few conditions, our prayers will be answered.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These few conditions are equally applicable to those who have prayed for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>These are very basic conditions, and we should pay attention to them.</S>
