   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF NUMBERS MESSAGE THREE BEING FORMED INTO AN ARMY 2 Scripture Reading: Num 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we will consider the matter of the children of Israel encamping in array.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>ENCAMPING IN ARRAY</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In Numbers 2 we see that the children of Israel encamped in array.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To put something in array is to set out something in a beautiful arrangement for a display.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the tribes encamped in array were in a beautiful order.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this array were the twelve tribes, the three families of the sons of Levi, and an extraordinary group including Moses, Aaron, and the sons of Aaron, the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A. The Children of Israel Encamping</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>in Array Typifying God's Redeemed People</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Being Consummated in the New Jerusalem</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The children of Israel encamping in array typifies God's redeemed people being consummated in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to our observation and the outward appearance of the situation of the church today, there does not seem to be any encamping in array.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the Catholic church, the state churches, the denominations, and the independent groups, there is much confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In all these there are real believers, who are God's chosen ones.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, among the real ones, there are many tares, many false believers, as revealed in the parable in Matthew 13:24-30, 36-43.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Of course, God's formed army does not include the tares; only the genuine believers in Christ throughout the generations are counted.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All these believers, after being saved, sanctified, renewed, transformed, and conformed to the image of Christ, will be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this glorification will be seen the reality of the New Jerusalem as the consummation of God's work, in His New Testament economy, of the new creation in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God will spend four dispensations to work His new creation out of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually, God's work of the new creation will consummate in one entity the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There we will see God's redeemed people camping in array.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today, however, the situation among the children of God is a mess that causes us to mourn and weep.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But we believe that out of this weeping there will be a jubilee.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First, there will be a jubilee on a smaller scale during the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then there will be a jubilee on a full scale for eternity in the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The entire Bible of sixty-six books shows us one thing God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God's economy is, first, to work out the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then out of the old creation, God uses four dispensations to bring forth the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today, this new creation consummates in the church; in the millennium it will consummate in the New Jerusalem on a smaller scale; and in the new heaven and new earth it will consummate in the New Jerusalem on a full scale.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The consummation of the picture of God's economy revealed in the Bible is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When God shows us a picture, He does not care for all the negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He cares only for what He sees.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Matthew 13 there are negative things the tares, the leaven, and the big tree among the precious things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God in His economy does not care for these but for the wheat the plant life , which will be transformed in nature to become gold, pearls, and precious stones minerals .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All these precious things will consummate in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the New Jerusalem we will not see tares, leaven, or the big tree; instead, we will see gold, pearls, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must admit that, at present, we still have some leaven and some of the element of the big tree.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To have the element of the big tree is to desire to be great and have a nice facade.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We confess that leaven and the element of the big tree are with us, even within us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Nevertheless, we may have the joyous assurance that we also have gold, pearls, and precious stones and that these are growing and increasing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may have such an assurance concerning ourselves and also concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we look at our church and our work, we may be grieved by the damage caused by the messy situation among us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Matthew 13 shows us that this is unavoidable.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One day we will go from Matthew 13 all the way to Revelation 21 and 22, where we see the New Jerusalem constituted of gold, pearls, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the present church life the elders may have more headaches than joy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, they should not cast the church aside but should go on until they get out of Matthew 13 and reach the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>First, we will reach the New Jerusalem in the millennial kingdom, which will still be in the old creation but will be in a revived dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we are faithful to the Lord in this life, we will be there in the millennial kingdom to participate in the New Jerusalem before the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, if we are defeated, God will deal with us quite severely for a thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The New Jerusalem in the millennial kingdom Rev 3:12 will be a prize only to the overcoming saints, whereas the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth will be the common portion of all the redeemed for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the new heaven and new earth all God's redeemed people will be perfected and completed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Thus, for eternity in the New Jerusalem there will be no dust but rather gold, pearls, and precious stones.</S>
