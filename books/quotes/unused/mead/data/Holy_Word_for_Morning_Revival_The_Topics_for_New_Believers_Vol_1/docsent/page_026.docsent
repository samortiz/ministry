   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 4 DAY 5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Rom 12:1 I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Lev 3:11 And the priest shall burn the sacrifice on the altar; it is the food of the offering by fire to Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Meaning of Consecration</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Romans 12:1 shows us that the meaning of consecration is to be a "sacrifice."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What does the phrase "to be a sacrifice" mean?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What is a sacrifice?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Scripture shows us that whenever a thing is set apart from its original position and usage and is laid on God's altar, specifically for Him, this thing is then a sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Old Testament men offered bullocks and rams as sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The principle is this: The bullock originally lived in a corral and was used for plowing the field and drawing carts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now it is taken out from the corral and brought beside the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is a change in its position.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then it is killed, placed on the altar, and consumed by fire to be a sweet-smelling savor unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a change in its usage.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, this bullock becomes a sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A sacrifice, therefore, is none other than a thing which is set apart for God and laid on the altar, with a change in position and a change in usage.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whether it is a bullock or a ram, whether it is fine flour or oil, once it is offered as a sacrifice, it leaves the hands of the offerer and can no longer be used for his own advantage and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we thus present ourselves to God as a sacrifice, we become food for God; we are for His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Among the offerings of the Israelites, some were for God's use, such as gold, silver, precious stones, threads of all colors, wool, and sheepskin Exo 25:2-7 ; and some were offered to God for food, such as the bullock, ram, pigeon, and turtledove used in the burnt offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When these were offered as a burnt offering, they were burnt on the altar and became a sweet savor, food for God Lev 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When God accepted the sweet savor of these sacrifices, He was satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>98</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Purpose of Consecration</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Since the meaning of consecration is to become a sacrifice, the thing offered is something which is entirely for God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The purpose of consecration, therefore, is to be used by God, to work for God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But in order that we may work for God, we must first let God work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, when we consecrate ourselves to God, although it is to work for God, yet from our standpoint the emphasis is to let God work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The purpose of consecration then is to let God work in order that we might reach the stage of working for God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The offering of the sacrifices in the Old Testament also sheds light on this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the bullocks and rams were killed and offered to God as burnt offerings, it was first necessary for God to do His thorough work upon them, that is, to consume them by fire, if they were to be pleasing and acceptable to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the sacrifices were not consumed by fire, they would be raw and foul-smelling and could never be acceptable or pleasing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our consecration today is just like that.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have already offered ourselves, yet if we do not allow God to work first, but go out to work for Him and serve Him directly, that work and that service will be raw, untempered, and foul-smelling.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It can never be accepted by God, let alone satisfy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we want to touch spiritual things we must first allow God to work on us that we might be broken, subdued, and disciplined by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must be severe with ourselves and ask whether our consecration to God is for working for God directly or for allowing God to work in us first.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Consequently, after our consecration we must not first be anxious to accomplish something for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to remain on the altar and allow God to work on us and consume us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The result of this consuming work will enable us to work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This consecration, this service, is ripe and resurrected; it is acceptable to God and satisfies Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In conclusion, the object of consecration is to let God work in us that we may work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>99</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Enlightenment and inspiration:</S>
