   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>2, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As the holy city of God, the New Jerusalem is holy, sanctified, fully separated unto God, and thoroughly saturated with God s holy nature to be His habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This holy city is thoroughly permeated and mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This great city, more than thirteen hundred and sixty miles in length, width, and height, will be utterly separated unto God and saturated with Him.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 2 says that the New Jerusalem is prepared as a bride adorned for her husband, and in verse 9 one of the angels says, Come here, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The spouse is for God s satisfaction in love.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As the Bride of Christ, New Jerusalem comes out of Christ, her husband, and becomes His counterpart, just as Eve came out of Adam, her husband, and became his counterpart Gen 2:21-24 .</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The tabernacle made by Moses was a type of this tabernacle Exo 25:8-9; Lev 26:11 .</S>

   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In no other place are we as fully expressed as we are in our dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you want to know a person, visit his apartment or house.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If his home is not neat, then you know that the person himself is not a neat person.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But if his home is very neat, clean, and orderly, then you know that the person who dwells there is that kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Suppose I visit your apartment one morning and find that your bed is not made.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>No matter how many lectures you may give me on diligence and neatness, I shall know by your unmade bed that you are a sloppy person.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Just as our home expresses us, so the New Jerusalem, God s tabernacle, will express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Every part of this city will be neat, clean, and properly built.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Every aspect of it will express God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The church today as God s habitation is also His expression.</S>
