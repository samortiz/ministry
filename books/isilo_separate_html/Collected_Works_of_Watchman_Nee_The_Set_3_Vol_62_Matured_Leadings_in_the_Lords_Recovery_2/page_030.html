This was the only time he adjusted the standard of his living. (Before he was married, he was called to the Lord's work. Later, he went full-time to serve the Lord.) From that time until his death, he never changed the standard of his living. After his death, others listed his income. His earning in later years did increase. Every year he earned ten to twenty thousand pounds. (Both he and his brother Charles were songwriters, and they had income from royalties.) The year before he died he earned the most&mdash;over twenty thousand pounds. But he maintained the same standard of living throughout. All of his excess was spent on the gospel, on literature, and on tracts. He also offered what he had for the Lord's work by training more people and sending them out for the Lord.</p><p>All the brothers and sisters who are in business, who hold jobs, or who are housewives at home should have a list. They have to make a vow before the Lord as to the standard of living they want to maintain. Once they have set the standard, they have to maintain it with an unfeigned conscience. They should not regret later and say, "I cannot make it. I do not have the faith or the resources, etc." Not only must the husband and the wife discuss among themselves, but the two must go to the Lord together to seek His will and to make a covenant with Him. One brother in Fukien has set a limit of four dollars per month for himself. Many brothers have praised him for this, but I say that this was wrong. There is no need to mortify ourselves or purposely starve or freeze ourselves to death. If this brother continues this way, he will get sick one day and have to spend even more money on himself. Many brothers and sisters are very smart when it comes to their money. They are very clever, but they do not understand a thing about spiritual matters. Some people have no spiritual understanding before they consecrate themselves. But once they hand themselves over, their spiritual understanding is enlightened. Therefore, we should not underestimate the practice of a secret covenant before the Lord.</p><p>To the world, forsaking everything to follow the Lord is a reckless act. But this is only one small part of a Christian's overall service to God. Our career, body, time, and future must also be consecrated. We will not make public the lists that the brothers and sisters have handed over to us. They are a means for the responsible brothers to get to know you and render proper help to you. Some people may be offering too little. Others may be offering too much. The responsible brothers can render help according to your list.</p><h2 class="head1">THE REAL CHRISTIAN STANDARD&mdash;<br />WALKING ACCORDING TO<br />THE DEMAND OF CHRIST WITHIN</h2><p>Witness Lee: I have often thought that God's love is very much misunderstood by man, but Christianity is also very much misunderstood by man. In the Bible there is no such term as Christianity. The Bible only says that individual believers are Christians, and the whole Body of believers is the church. There is no such term as Christianity. A Christian is one who believes in the Lord and who possesses His life. Many brothers and sisters have become Christians, but they do not know what it means to be a Christian. If we ask a Christian what a Christian is, many will give strange answers. Someone may answer, "As long as a man has Christ and His life, he is a Christian." Even this answer is not easy to comprehend. We may say this with our mouth, but we are not this kind of person. One day when God opens our eyes, we will know what a Christian is. Today it is as rare to find a person who knows what a Christian is as it is to find the morning star.</p><p>What is a Christian in man's concept and view? Some think that a Christian is one who follows the teachings and creeds of Christianity, attends Sunday morning service, and tithes. Strictly speaking, being a Christian has nothing to do with these outward things. Christianity is not a religion or a teaching based on the Bible; it is not to zealously practice teachings that are based on the Bible. Christians are those who pay attention to the inward things. They pay attention to the things that are in Christ. A Christian is one who is in Christ. This may sound objective, abstract, or general. Let me put it another way. A Christian is one in whom Christ dwells. Today you are a Christian. On what standard do you practice your Christian life? Does Christian conduct consist solely of keeping ordinances? Is his standard merely the Bible? We have to say, "No." Let me ask Miss Nee, "Do you take the teachings, slogans, and beliefs of No. 7, Jordan Road as your standard of Christian life?" (She shakes her head.) Brother Ma, what would you say? (Brother Weigh answers, "According to the demand of the Christ within us.") There are two answers. One is to act according to the teachings of the Bible. The other is to act according to the sense of the inward leading of the Holy Spirit. Some say that a Christian is one who imitates Christ, but it is not easy to imitate Christ. It is not a matter of seeing Christ jump in front of us and copying Him. The genuine experience of a Christian is not outward; it comes from within. Although we may have outward activities occasionally, the source of these activities must come from within.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> </body></html>
