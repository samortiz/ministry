   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Its Issue</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Peter's writings, the believers' growth in the divine life also has its issues.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To Enjoy the Continual and Daily Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the writings of Peter the first issue of the believers' growth in life is to enjoy the continual and daily salvation 1 Pet 2:2b .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to drink the milk of the word so that we may grow unto salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is not the salvation from perdition, from hell; rather, it is the salvation in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To overcome our temper, especially in relation to our spouse, we need salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To be a husband or wife requires a great deal of salvation every day.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Without experiencing salvation in many aspects, we cannot be a proper Christian husband or wife.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every husband is a trouble to his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every husband is a particular person who has particular traits.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How much salvation the wives need!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every wife needs to learn to rely on God's salvation, not on her own cleverness, in dealing with her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We all need salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To Be Fruitful</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Another issue of the growth in life is to be fruitful 2 Pet 1:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we grow in life, we will bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To Be Transformed into Living Stones</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>as Materials for the Building Up</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>of the Spiritual House of God, Consummating</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>in the Priesthood for Offering Up</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Spiritual Sacrifices Acceptable to God</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Peter in his first Epistle unveils to us that the Lord is a living stone and that we, by contacting Him, also become living stones 2:4-5a .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We were created as pieces of clay in nature Gen 2:7a; Rom 9:21 , but by growing in Christ we become stones, transformed metabolically in our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These stones are suitable as materials for the building up of the spiritual house of God 1 Pet 2:5b , which consummates in the New Testament priesthood of the gospel for offering up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God in our gospel preaching 1 Pet 2:5c, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To preach the gospel is to tell out the sweet virtues, in a sweet way, of the Lord, who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This kind of gospel preaching, as an issue of our transformation through our growth in the divine life, should be by a group of believers not by some individualistic believers built up into a priesthood not some individualistic priests as a corporate body of priests, carrying out the spreading of the Lord's glad tidings as a corporate testimony to the sinners in the world, in telling out the sweet virtues, such as love, lovingkindness, grace, light, forgiveness, redemption, salvation, etc., of the Lord in a sweet and delightful way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Surely this kind of victorious, vital, and corporate trumpeting of the good news from the heavens would be triumphant and successful.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the goal which our vital groups should reach!</S>
