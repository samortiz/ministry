(1 Cor. 12:3).</P><P>We will hold a special conference this year from October 8th (Thursday) to the 18th (the Lord willing). The purpose of this conference is to unite all the believers in every place who are of the same mind to wait before God and receive the message which will come from Him. Past experience tells us that we must all receive deeper edification. For this reason, we must lay much emphasis on the testimony of "the victory of Christ" which the Lord has committed to us. May those who intercede before the Lord pray in one accord for this conference that we may genuinely have the power which is purely of the Holy Spirit with no mixture of soulish power whatsoever. Amen!</P><P>We are very glad that Brother Wang Lien-chun has promised to be with us in this conference.</P><P>As to the schedule of this conference, we have already put out a separate announcement. If anyone has not received it yet, please write to Mr. Chow Shing-yee, P.O. Box 323, Shanghai.</P><P>Sincerely Yours,<br>Watchman Nee<br>A Christian in Shanghai<br>On behalf of the co-workers<br>July 29, 1931, Shanghai</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> </body></html>
