   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3 Justified by God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Noah believed in God and, as a result, became a righteous person.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He was right with God, with others, and with himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>None of the worldly people are right with God, with others, or with themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, Noah was a righteous man Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>14:14 , and Hebrews 11:7 says that he "became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Firstly, Noah found grace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Secondly, because God had been transfused into him, he believed in God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because God's believing element was transfused into him, Noah had the believing faculty.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He believed in God, and immediately his believing was reckoned unto him by God as righteousness as God did with Abraham Rom 4:3, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Moreover, because he found grace in the eyes of the Lord, this grace strengthened him and helped him to live a righteous life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In his daily walk, righteousness was lived out of him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This kind of righteousness was not merely objective, but also subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Firstly, he received objective righteousness; eventually, he lived out subjective righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, in the eyes of God, Noah inherited righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the sixth chapter of Genesis, we see three important seeds: flesh, grace, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This matter of the flesh is fully developed in the New Testament, particularly in the Epistles, and especially in Romans 7 and 8.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since we have covered this in the Life-study of Romans, we need not to repeat it now.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do you realize that God's grace came because of the flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us..full of grace.."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In a good sense, where there is flesh, there is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What is flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The flesh is Satan's masterpiece.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do you know where Satan is today?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The flesh is the meeting hall of Satan, sin, and death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These three great enemies continually meet together in the hall of our flesh, and their meeting is never dismissed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I cannot tell you how many thousands of years this meeting has been going on.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The flesh is such an ugly thing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What then is grace?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Grace is God Himself enjoyed by us and helping us to face the situation of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In a sense, if there were no flesh, grace would not be so much needed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If it were not for the flesh, probably God would not have to give us so much grace.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have seen that, according to Hebrews 4:16, we may find grace to meet our timely need.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What element causes us to need grace?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is mainly the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I sympathize with the young people, for I was once a young man myself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As I passed through all the human experiences, I came to realize how much we are in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although I do not like to be in the flesh, the flesh is here.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Once I got mad at the Lord and said to Him, "Lord, why don't You take away my flesh?"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Eventually He showed me that, in a sense, I needed the flesh, for the flesh is the very factor that compels me to come to the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I cannot do anything with this flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All I can do is go to the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although there is nothing that we can do, yet there is somewhere that we can go the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you read the New Testament carefully, you will see that where the flesh is, there also is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is especially true in the book of Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Galatians 5:4 says that if we attempt to be justified by the law, we are fallen from grace.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Galatians deals with this matter of the flesh, and it also speaks much about the matter of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do not say that you do not have the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You have a great deal of flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Even as you read this message, you have the flesh to contend with.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Let us come to the throne of grace for the sake of dealing with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Because the flesh is here with us, we need grace.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The flesh is the very presence of the Devil, and grace is the very presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In order for us to face the presence of Satan, we need the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Where is Satan?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do not think that Satan is far away from you.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He is within you.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Every minute, even while you are praying, Satan is in your flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A good number of times my prayers have been frustrated by the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Even in the holiest time, the time of prayer, the flesh is a frustration.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This frustration of the flesh forces us to come to the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Although the flesh is the presence of Satan, over and against it we have grace, which is the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>How strong are you?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Are you strong enough to overcome Satan?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Do you think that you can deal with him?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Forget such thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Satan is much greater than we are.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Although Satan is greater than we are, God is greater than Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God is the greatest.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Since Satan is here with us, we need God to be present.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We have to say, "Lord, You know Your enemy is right here.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>You have to come and stand with me against him."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When God comes to us and stands with us, that is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God is sovereign and wise.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He knows that if He were to take away the flesh, probably very few of us would be desperate to seek His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In His sovereignty and wisdom, He leaves the flesh here, knowing that, in a sense, it is useful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Day and night the flesh helps us turn to the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When we are matured, that is, when we are raptured, we will be able to turn to the flesh and say, "Little flesh, your time is over.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>You may leave now."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Before the maturity of life, in a sense we need the flesh, not to damage us, but to force us to come to the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Where the flesh is, there is grace, and where grace is, there is the issue of grace righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Romans 5:17 puts grace and righteousness together.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This verse says that "those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Righteousness always accompanies grace.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>There is not one husband who can be right with his wife without grace, and there is not one wife who can be right with her husband without grace.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>There is only one kind of wife or husband who is right the wife or husband who finds grace.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Once we have found grace, grace will make us right with our husband or wife.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Consider the case of a particular husband who for years has been told by others that he should treat his wife better than he does.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Nevertheless, he is not convinced.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>One night he finds grace, and grace issues in righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Immediately he changes his attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>It is by the power of grace, the strength of grace, and the life of grace that we can be right with God, with one another, and even with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Grace produces righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Righteousness is the highest product of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Therefore, Romans 5:21 says that "grace might reign through righteousness unto eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Thus, righteousness and grace always go together.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Where the flesh is, there is grace, and where grace is, righteousness is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We who have found grace are righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We are more righteous than others because of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We are not righteous because of ourselves, but because of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>It is even possible to boast that the church members are more righteous than other people.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>They are righteous because they have found grace.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Righteousness not only became a boast to Noah; it was also a boast to God.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>God was able to boast to His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>God could boast of Noah's righteousness to that crooked and perverse generation.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Noah's righteousness strengthened God's standing to execute His judgment upon that ungodly generation.</S>
