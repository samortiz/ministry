   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Renouncing a Royal Position</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Hebrews 11:24 says, By faith Moses, having become great, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh s daughter.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some historians believe that if Moses had remained in the Egyptian palace, he would have been the heir to the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Nevertheless, he renounced a royal position in Egypt, the highest rank in the world at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>D. Choosing to Suffer Affliction</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>with the People of God</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hebrews 11:25 and 26 continue, Choosing rather to be ill-treated with the people of God than to have the temporary enjoyment of sin, esteeming the reproach of the Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt, for he looked away to the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here we see that Moses paid a price to stand with the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He preferred to suffer affliction with God s people rather than to have the temporary enjoyment of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The enjoyment in Egypt, that is, the enjoyment of the pleasures in the world, is sinful in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is the enjoyment of sin, of a sinful life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is temporary, short-lived, and fleeting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>E. Leaving Egypt by Faith</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>and Not Fearing the Wrath of Pharaoh</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hebrews 11:27 says of Moses, By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Apparently there is a contradiction between Hebrews 11:27, which says that Moses did not fear the wrath of the king, and Exodus 2:14, which says that Moses feared.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Actually, there is no contradiction.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Outwardly, Moses was afraid and sought to escape.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Inwardly, however, he considered the cost and voluntarily chose to identify himself with the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>F. Persevering, as Seeing Him</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Who Is Invisible</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hebrews 11:27 also says that Moses was steadfast as seeing the invisible One.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was steadfast, persevering, because the invisible God was working on him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God s work was so real that it was just as if Moses saw the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THROUGH BEING ACCEPTED BY THE HEATHEN A. Helping the Weak and Suffering Females</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>and Being Appreciated and Recommended</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>by the Female Life</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After Moses was rejected by the brothers and fled to the land of Midian, he helped the weak and suffering females, who had been mistreated by the shepherds vv.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In turn, Moses was received by them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Moses was rejected by the brothers because he was too bold, but he was received by the females because he rendered help to them in their suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The females, seven daughters of the priest of Midian, were weaker vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When some men took control of the well, they could do nothing about it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock v. 17 . As a result, they received Moses and spoke well of him to their father.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, the female life is not only the life that God can use to raise up something for His purpose, but also the life that receives what He has raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this chapter the picture of the male life is for the most part very dark, but the portrait of the female life is lovely and very positive.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In principle, during times of persecution the suffering ones are comforted mainly by the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For example, when Peter was released from prison, he went not to the home of a brother, but to the home of a sister where some had gathered together to pray Acts 12:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Brother Nee s experience also illustrates this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The sisters appreciated him and comforted him in times of distress.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Most of the brothers put Brother Nee on the cross, whereas the sisters received him and comforted him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As I became aware of this in Shanghai, I learned not to be such a male, one who was dissenting, cold, or neutral, but to become a female, one who was receptive and comforting.</S>
