<h2 class="head1">FOREWORD</h2>
<p>This book is comprised of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in the spring of 1970 that were spoken weekly to the church in Los Angeles, California during a time of informal training. His burden in speaking this word at that time was to fellowship with the saints the New Testament principles of our service to the Lord in the church life.</p>
<p>In the chapters that follow we can see that the New Testament service is outside of religion and contrary to human culture, new in time and new in nature, and altogether of and with Christ, having Him as the very center. It is a service that is of the Holy Spirit with the goal to bring forth Christ for the fulfillment of His purpose; it is living, fresh, and without any natural concept or element, having the living, instant guidance of Christ that brings us to Himself. It is a service in the aspects of life and work that is not individual but in coordination in the Body in every aspect, caring for Jesus only and being separated from all earthly involvements.</p>
<p>Those of us that were in the meetings when these messages were given or heard them later on audio tapes can testify of the immense help that was rendered to us in our spiritual service. The fellowship contained in the following pages became the governing principles by which many have learned to serve in the church life. It is a word that is very basic and very much up-to-date. We are thankful to the Lord that these messages are now in print, and we pray that the New Testament principles of service will become a living and practical reality in all the churches.</p>
