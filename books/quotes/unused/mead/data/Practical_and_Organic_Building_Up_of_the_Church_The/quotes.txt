[1]  The Practical and Organic Building Up of the Church CONTENTS
[2]  GOD S HEART AND WILL Scripture Reading: Acts 13:22, 36; Eph 1:9-11; 3:9-11; Heb 10:5-10; Rom 12:1-21
[3]  Ephesians speaks of God s will 1:5, 9 , the counsel of God s will 1:11 , God s good pleasure, the desire of God s heart 1:9 , the mystery of God s will 1:9 , and the dispensation of the mystery 3:9 .
[4]  The church as the Body of Christ is the enlargement of Christ, and this enlargement of Christ is Christ s expression.
[5]  However, how could this Body of Christ, the church, which is the enlargement and expression of God s embodiment, come into being?
[6]  The second aspect of God s will is to have Christ as the replacement for all the sacrifices and offerings, that we may enjoy Him as our all in all Heb 10:5-10 .
[7]  Hebrews 10:5 says, Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but a body You have prepared for Me. God prepared a body for Christ so that He could offer Himself to God to replace all the offerings.
[8]  Christ is our God in His humanity, and He is our Apostle bringing God to us and our High Priest bringing us to God.
[9]  For this we must first present our bodies to God as a living sacrifice to do the will of God, that is, to practice the Body life v. 1 , not being conformed to this age but being transformed by the renewing of the mind that we may prove the will of God, which is that we practice the Body life vv.
[10]  If we are such persons, we will have the practice of the Body life and a life of the highest virtues by God s divine life and love.
[11]  The Body of Christ comes out of our enjoyment of Christ, and our enjoyment of Christ issues in the church life, which is a strong testimony, testifying that God has been processed to be everything to us for our enjoyment.
[12]  OF THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: John 17:20-23; Matt 28:19; Eph 4:2-6, 12-15; 1:22-23
[13]  In the last chapter, we saw that we need to be those living a life according to God s heart and will.
[14]  The prayer of the Lord in John 17 shows that the organic oneness of the Body of Christ is the organic oneness in the Triune God.
[15]  Before we believed in the Lord Jesus, we were separate from the coinhering Triune God, but now we are in the Triune God.
[16]  God the Father s being in the Son, God the Son s being in the Father, the Father and the Son s being in the Spirit, and the Spirit s being in the Father and the Son has an issue, an outcome.
[17]  Matthew 28:19 refers to a marvelous fact in the universe: we believers have been baptized into the Triune God.
[18]  This verse says that we have been baptized into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit.
[19]  The name of the Triune God denotes the person of the Triune God.
[20]  Our baptism brought us into a mystical and organic union with the processed Triune God so that all of us, the believers in the Son, may be one in this organic union.
[21]  The oneness in the Divine Trinity can be seen in Ephesians 4:4-6: One Body and one Spirit, as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.
[22]  Instead, he once stayed with the church in Ephesus for three years v. 31 . While Paul was on his way to Jerusalem, he sent some from Miletus to call the elders in Ephesus to come to him v. 17 . When they came to him, Paul reminded them of how he behaved, worked, and labored among them for three years, admonishing the saints with tears v. 31 and teaching them publicly and from house to house v. 20 . He charged them to take heed to themselves and to the flock committed to them v. 28 . He warned them that after he would leave, wolves would come in among them, not sparing the flock v. 29 . He told them that some would rise up from among them, speaking perverted things to draw away disciples after themselves v. 30 . This portion of the Word in Acts 20 shows that Paul did not leave the church in Ephesus alone.
[23]  CHAPTER THREE BEGETTING, NOURISHING, AND PERFECTING Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 4:15; John 15:16; Eph 3:8-11; John 21:15-17; Acts 5:42; 1 Thes 2:7; Eph 4:12; 1 Thes 2:11 THE ORGANIC BUILDING UP
[24]  In this chapter and the next chapter, we want to see four crucial matters for the organic building up of the Body of Christ.
[25]  The New Testament tells us emphatically that the church is the Body of Christ Eph 1:22-23; Rom 12:5; 1 Cor 12:12 .
[26]  The church also was born of God, in Christ, through Christ, and with Christ to be the Body of Christ.
[27]  Apparently, the church is merely a kind of gathering, but actually the church is something born of God, with Christ, and through Christ to become Christ s Body, His organism to express His very being.
[28]  For the organic building up of the Body of Christ we first need to beget others, to bear fruit 1 Cor 4:15; John 15:16a .
[29]  In John 15 the Lord likened Himself with all the members of His Body to a vine tree with its branches.
[30]  When we preach the gospel, we also need to consider how many people we will be able to care for.
[31]  We may be able to save many people, but can we take care of them all?
[32]  We need to go on from nourishing the new ones in the home meetings to perfecting the saints, to equipping them Eph 4:12 .
[33]  In these small group meetings, we need to teach the believers as a father 1 Thes 2:11 so that they can carry out the practical church life for the work of the New Testament ministry the organic building up of the Body of Christ.
[34]  CHAPTER FOUR PROPHESYING Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 14:12, 4-5, 31, 24, 1, 39a; Acts 5:20
[35]  According to the New Testament revelation, four crucial matters are needed to build up the church as the organic Body of Christ.
[36]  God s intention, His heart s desire, is to have a Body to be the enlargement and expression of Christ.
[37]  God s economy is His arrangement to gain a Body for Christ, built up with human beings mingled with the divinity of the Triune God.
[38]  Today we are in the center of God s purpose to build up the church as the organic, living Body of Christ.
[39]  After baptizing people, we must bear the burden to care for them.
[40]  If we baptize them, we will be like nursing mothers, loving them and considering them as little babes.
[41]  The believers can all prophesy that all may learn and all may be encouraged v. 31 . The believers should all prophesy to convict people and to judge people v. 24 . When one person speaks and the rest listen, some general help can be given, but the riches of Christ can come only from a certain individual.
[42]  If twenty speak in the meeting, the riches of Christ can be displayed in a much fuller way.
[43]  The characteristic of prophesying is to speak for the Lord, to speak forth the Lord, and to speak the Lord into people, to minister Christ for the organic building up of the church, in larger meetings of the church.
[44]  If our service in the church is only to preach the gospel, have home meetings, and have small group meetings, we have not arrived at the ultimate point for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ.
[45]  In these days the Lord has been leading us into the vision and realization of the organic Body of Christ.
[46]  The New Testament shows us that God s intention is to gain an organic Body for Christ.
[47]  We may not be clear about this because we may consider the church merely as a congregation, an assembly, or a gathering, but we need to see that the church is the Body of Christ.
[48]  Now we want to go on to see the position of the Word in the organic building up of the church.
[49]  The Bible tells us that the Spirit is God and that the Word is God.
[50]  In the previous chapter, we saw the crucial need for the Spirit and the Word in the organic building up of the church.
[51]  The entire Bible, both the Old and New Testaments, unveils that God s heart s desire is to build up a Body for Christ.
[52]  The prevailing way to preach the gospel is to disciple the nations and baptize them into the Triune God, to minister Christ in His riches to the nations, to beget sinners, making them children of God that they may become members of the organic Body of Christ, and to bear fruit for the glorification, the expression, of the Father.
[53]  I hope that in the Lord s recovery, our concept concerning going out to preach the gospel will be altogether revolutionized.
[54]  If I ask you what you are going to do when you are going to preach the gospel, you should say, I am going to beget some that they may become the members of the organic Body of Christ.
[55]  We need to tell people, You have nothing to do with Christ, but I am here to beget you, to regenerate you, to make you a living member of Christ.
[56]  Christ is life, Christ is joy, Christ is peace, Christ is light, and Christ is everything that we need.
[57]  If we speak with people about ministering Christ in His riches, begetting sinners that they may become God s children and the members of the living Body of Christ, and bearing fruit, we can go on to speak concerning discipling the nations.
[58]  CHAPTER SEVEN TO PERFECT THE SAINTS Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 2:11; Acts 20:20, 27, 31; John 21:16; Eph 4:12-13, 15-16
[59]  We have seen that we need to cooperate with the Lord to save sinners and to nourish and cherish the newly baptized ones.
[60]  This crucial item has been lacking among us, but Paul stresses this matter to the uttermost in the book of Ephesians, a crucial book concerning the Body of Christ.
[61]  Acts 20:20 and 27 tell us that Paul taught the believers publicly and from house to house, not shrinking from declaring to them all the counsel of God.
[62]  We need to perfect the saints as the evangelists do by stirring up the believers to have a burning spirit for the gospel and by teaching and instructing the believers to preach the gospel.
[63]  We need to gather the believers into small groups and have group meetings with them regularly for fellowship, prayer, raising up, building up, and carrying out the practical church life, that they may arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ Eph 4:12-13 .
[64]  In the previous chapters, we have seen our need to help sinners to be saved and become the organic members of the Body of Christ.
[65]  This is the first thing we must do for the building up of the Body of Christ.
[66]  In the group meetings a continuous fellowship should be maintained among the attendants.
[67]  Then they will know each other and will offer prayers to God for one another.
[68]  Brother, you have been saved for three months, and you have this divine life, but even we who have been in the Lord for over fifteen years still feel that we do not have enough of the divine life.
[69]  Prophesying excels the other spiritual gifts 1 Cor 14:12 .
[70]  It is the particular gift for the organic building up of the church as the Body of Christ 1 Cor 14:4-5 .
[71]  In the previous chapters, we have seen that according to God s ordained way for the building up of the Body of Christ organically, we all have to do four main things.
[72]  First, we have to gain the new ones so that the Lord can regenerate them and make them the living members of the Body of Christ.
[73]  Second, we have to continue to have meetings with them in their homes to cherish them, to nourish them, and to take care of them in every way that they may be established.
[74]  Our life is not adequate to take care of the new ones, to have fellowship with them, to pray with them, to take care of them mutually, to build them up in teaching them the truth, and to stir them up to seek after the divine life that they may grow in this life.
[75]  If we are going to carry out the organic building up of the Body of Christ, we must have our life changed from our natural life to the divine life, from our temporal life to the eternal life.
[76]  Our human life is good for our existence, but it is altogether not qualified and not able to do the things to accomplish God s New Testament economy.
[77]  God s New Testament economy is accomplished by the divine life living in the human life.
[78]  To say that we need the divine life does not mean that we take away our life and replace it with the divine life.
[79]  The life that we need for the organic building up of the Body of Christ is the divine life of Christ Christ Himself as the life-giving Spirit within us John 14:6a; 1 Cor 15:45b .
[80]  Christ as the embodiment of God is the mingling of the human life with the divine life, and this life today is the life-giving Spirit.
[81]  The life that we need is also the resurrection life, which is the pneumatic Christ in resurrection John 11:25a with the resurrection power Phil 3:10a .
[82]  When we live on the cross, being conformed to the death of the cross, the resurrection life rises up from within us.
[83]  Every time we go out to visit people with the gospel, we must go with our natural life on the cross and under the death of the cross so that the resurrection life of God can have a chance to rise up within us to talk to people.
[84]  Whenever we go out to knock on doors for the preaching of the gospel, we need to go on the cross in the mold of Christ s death.
[85]  We realize that we need another life, that we have been made by God as vessels as the means through which God can work.
[86]  When we pray in such a way, we will be filled with the economical Spirit, and we will have the boldness to speak the word of God.
