IN THE TYPE OF THE LAMPSTAND</h2>
<p>Exodus 25:31 says, &ldquo;You shall make a lampstand of pure gold. The lampstand with its base and its shaft shall be made of beaten work.&rdquo; Verse 37 says, &ldquo;You shall make its lamps, seven.&rdquo; The lampstand as God&rsquo;s embodiment (Christ the Son), gold as God&rsquo;s nature (the Father), and the seven lamps as God&rsquo;s expression (the sevenfold Spirit) signify the Divine Trinity and show that the Triune God is consummated as the sevenfold intensified Spirit to shine out the Triune God as light into us (Rev. 4:5; 5:6).</p>

IN THE TYPE OF THE COMPOUND OINTMENT</h2>
<p>Exodus 30:23-25 says, &ldquo;You also take the finest spices: of flowing myrrh five hundred shekels, and of fragrant cinnamon half as much, two hundred fifty shekels, and of fragrant calamus two hundred fifty shekels, and of cassia five hundred shekels...and a hin of olive oil. And you shall make it a holy anointing oil, a fragrant ointment compounded.&rdquo; One hin signifies the unique God, and olive oil signifies the Spirit of God. The three units of five hundred shekels signify the Triune God; the split middle unit, comprising two units of two hundred fifty shekels each, signifies the crucified Christ as the second of the Divine Trinity. Four signifies the human nature of Christ. The spices signify Christ&rsquo;s death (myrrh), the effectiveness of Christ&rsquo;s death (cinnamon), Christ&rsquo;s resurrection (calamus), and the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection (cassia). All these ingredients and measurements are compounded into one ointment as the holy anointing oil, signifying the processed, all-inclusive compound Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God to anoint His redeemed people. The compound ointment was used to anoint the tabernacle, the altar, and the priests. Anointing is similar to painting. When paint is applied to an object, the paint becomes one with the painted object. We are &ldquo;painted&rdquo; with the Triune God and thereby become one with Him. The Triune God was processed to become the all-inclusive compound Spirit for the purpose that the Triune God in His ultimate expression may impart His divine element with all the processes He went through, including incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, into His redeemed people, making them one with Him.</p>

IN THE SPIRIT OF GOD FILLING<br />
THE WORKERS OF THE TABERNACLE</h2>
<p>Exodus 31:3 says, &ldquo;I [Jehovah] have filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom and with understanding and with knowledge and with all kinds of workmanship.&rdquo; Exodus 35:31 says, &ldquo;He [Jehovah] has filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom.&rdquo; The design of the various parts of the tabernacle with all its furniture is marvelous. No human mind could produce such a design. The wisdom came from the Spirit, who is God Himself. For the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling, which is the church today, what is needed is not a momentary, sudden outpouring of the Spirit, as with speaking in tongues, but the inward filling of the Spirit. God filled the builders of the tabernacle with His Spirit not in power but in wisdom, understanding, knowledge, and workmanship. The Spirit of the Triune God (Elohim) filled the workers of the tabernacle for the building up of God&rsquo;s dwelling place on the earth so that the Triune God might be experienced and enjoyed by His redeemed people. The tabernacle was built so that God&rsquo;s redeemed people could enter into it to experience God and could stay there to enjoy God through the work of the filling Spirit, that is, of the Triune God.</p>
<p>In Exodus the Angel of Jehovah God as the second of the Trinity delivered God&rsquo;s people out of their bondage, brought them to the wilderness to feast with the Triune God, and brought them farther into the good land to enjoy the riches of the Divine Trinity. The Spirit of God as the third of the Divine Trinity and the ultimate expression of the Triune God, typified by the water flowing out of the cleft rock, the seven lamps of the lampstand, and the compound ointment, reached God&rsquo;s redeemed people to satisfy them, enlighten them, and anoint them with the element of the Triune God and all the &ldquo;ingredients&rdquo; of His processes for the building up of His habitation on the earth so that they might partake of Him, enjoy Him, and express Him.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Divine Trinity as Revealed in the Holy Word &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
