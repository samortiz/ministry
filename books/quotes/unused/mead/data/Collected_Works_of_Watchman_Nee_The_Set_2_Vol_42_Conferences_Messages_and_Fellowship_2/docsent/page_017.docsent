   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE UNIT OF SALVATION BEING THE HOUSEHOLD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What does Acts 16:31 mean?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Suppose you are the head of your house and you have believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You may say that the head has believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But in reality, more than just yourself have believed in the Lord; you have believed in the Lord on behalf of your whole household.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When you believe in the Lord, you have two standings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first is your personal stand before the Lord; as a sinner you have believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The second is your stand as a representative of the entire household; you have believed in the Lord on behalf of your whole family.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You can declare that your household is a household of believers and that God is the God of your house.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You are serving the Lord on behalf of your whole family.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do you remember Joshua's word?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He said that he and his household not just himself would serve Jehovah Josh 24:15b .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are short of these kinds of heads today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some may ask, "Does this mean that when the head of a household has believed in the Lord, that household is saved?"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yes, it does.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although everyone in the household has not received eternal life, they have all been saved positionally.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The world sees this household as a saved household.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some time thereafter, every member of the household will also receive eternal life in experience, one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is what it means to put the whole family in the position of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The question is whether or not a family has a proper head who is assuming the proper headship.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whether or not the children are going along is a secondary concern.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As long as the children are living in the house, and as long as you are the head of the house, you have made the choice for them already when you believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is because the house is yours and not theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You are responsible for the house; they are not responsible for it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When you take such a stand, others will follow; they will follow you to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a wonderful thing, and we can find many examples of it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the head becomes a proper head, the whole household receives grace and is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE PASSOVER LAMB BEING ONE PER HOUSEHOLD</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the Israelites prepared the Passover lamb in the Old Testament, they prepared one for each household, not one for each member of the household.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Passover lamb was for the household, not for individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>An individual did not kill a lamb; the household killed it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The blood was struck on the doorpost and side posts of the house, and the whole household was protected.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The angel of destruction passed over the whole household and spared the whole house.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This shows that the unit of God's salvation is the household.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the head of the household chose the lamb, the whole household had no choice but to choose the lamb as well.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here we see that the Old Testament concept is centered around the household.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>GOD'S JUDGMENT EXECUTED ON HOUSEHOLDS</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Ahab's household in the Old Testament is another example.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>First Kings 21:22 says, "And I will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God dealt with the house of Ahab because Ahab offended God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The house of Jeroboam provides another example.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First Kings 13:34 says, "And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Jeroboam set up the idols.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God judged his whole household and cut it off from the face of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Concerning the house of David, 2 Samuel 12:10-11 says, "Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house; because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>From these few instances we see that the household is not only the unit of God's salvation, but also the unit of God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God's judgment does not come to individuals, but to a house.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The standing of the head is considered to be the standing of the whole household.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, we see the concept of the household clearly established in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God deals with man by households.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The recipient of both salvation and judgment is the household.</S>
