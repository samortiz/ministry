   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY THE LORD CAME OUT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF HIS DIVINE FORM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND THE WAY HE RETURNED</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Concerning His deity, the Lord was equal with God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But His being the Lord was something given to Him by God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Being made the Lord is something that happened after He emptied Himself in His deity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The deity of the Lord Jesus is something that is based on what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Being God is His original position.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But His attainment of the position of Lord is based on what He has done.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When He laid aside His divine form to fully maintain the principle of submission and subsequently ascended to the heavens, God accorded to Him the position of Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Based on Himself, He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Based on His attainment, He is Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This lordship was not originally present in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This portion in Philippians 2 is very difficult to explain and very controversial.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But it is also a most divine passage.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today we have to come to this passage with our shoes off, standing on holy ground.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It seems as if there was a conference in the Godhead in the beginning in which a plan was made to create the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this plan the divine persons of the Godhead agreed with each other and came to the understanding that the Father would be the representation of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But if there was only authority without submission, authority could not be established, because authority is not something isolated.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, there must be submission in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Two kinds of creatures were created in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The first kind was the angels spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The second kind was man souls.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's foreknowledge foresaw the rebellion of the angels and the failure of man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God's authority cannot be built upon the angels or upon the descendants of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the Godhead there was a harmonious decision that authority would be established first within the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>From that time on, there was a distinction in operation of the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One day the Son willingly emptied Himself to become a created man as the representation of submission to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It was the creature that had rebelled.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, only the submission of a creature could establish God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was man who sinned and rebelled.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, only through the submission of a man could God's authority be established.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is why the Lord had to come to the earth to become a man and to be the same as a creature in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The birth of the Lord is the coming forth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He did not retain His authority by being God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Rather, He took up human restrictions by becoming a man, even the restriction of a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This was a very risky matter for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once the Lord stepped out from the form of God, there was a possibility that He could not return as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If He had not been submissive, He could have reclaimed the divine form of His deity only in His position as the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, the principle of submission would have been broken forever.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When the Lord stepped out, there were only two ways for Him to return.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One was to be a proper man, absolutely and unreservedly submitting with no trace of rebellion, being obedient step by step, and letting God bring Him back and set Him up as Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If being a slave had been too difficult for Him, if weakness and the limitations of the flesh had been too much for Him, and if submission had been beyond Him, the only other way to return would have been for Him to force His way back by using the authority and glory of His deity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But our Lord rejected this way, a way which He was not meant to take.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He set His heart to subject Himself to the way of submission even unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since He emptied Himself, He could no longer refill Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He did not vacillate in His mind.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Since He emptied Himself of all divine glory and authority and stepped forth as a slave, He did not want to go back by any other way than the way of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Before He returned, He completed His course of being obedient unto death in the position of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He was able to return because He accomplished a perfect and pure submission.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Suffering upon suffering was piled on Him, but He remained absolutely submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There was not the slightest reaction or rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, God exalted Him and ushered Him back as Lord in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This was not just a refilling of what had been emptied, but the ushering of a MAN into the Godhead by the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Son became Jesus the Man , and was received back into the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Now we know the preciousness of the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the whole universe there is no one like Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When the Lord declared, "It is done" on the cross, He did not mean that just salvation had been secured, but that everything that He said had been done.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For this He obtained a name that is above every name.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At the name of Jesus every knee should bow and every tongue should openly confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>From that time forward, He was not only God, but Lord as well.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>His lordship speaks of His relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It speaks of what He attained before God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>His being the Christ speaks of His relationship with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In short, when the Lord came forth from God, He did not intend to return by His deity.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Rather, He intended to return through His exaltation as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is how God maintains His principle of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is wrong for us to have even a trace of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should submit to authority completely.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Lord Jesus' return to heaven was through His being a man and being submissive in the form of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As a result He was exalted by God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We must come face-to-face with this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In the whole Bible there is hardly any passage as mysterious as this one.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Lord bade farewell to His divine form.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He did not return in just His divine form, because He had put on the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In Him there was no trace of disobedience; consequently, He was exalted by God in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He stepped forth to give up His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He returned to reclaim His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>All of this was accomplished by God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We need to have the mind in us which was in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>All of us should take the way of our Lord, taking His principle of submission as our principle unto submission and learning submission from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Whoever knows this principle will realize that no sin is uglier than rebellion and that nothing is more important than submission.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Only when we see the principle of submission can we serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>God's principle can be maintained only by submitting in the way that the Lord submitted.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Once there is rebellion, we are in the principle of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>LEARNING OBEDIENCE THROUGH SUFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Hebrews 5:8 tells us that the Lord's obedience was learned through suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Suffering brought obedience to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>True submission is found when there is still obedience in spite of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>A man's usefulness is not in whether he has suffered, but in whether he has learned obedience in suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Only those who are obedient to God are useful.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If the heart is not softened, the suffering will not go away.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Our way is the way of manifold sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>A man who yearns after ease and enjoyment is of no use.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We must all learn to be obedient in sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>When the Lord came to the earth, He did not bring obedience with Him; rather, He learned it through sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Salvation not only brings joy; it also brings submission.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If a man is only for joy, his experiences will not be abundant.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Only submissive ones will experience the fullness of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Otherwise, we change the nature of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We need to be submissive, even as the Lord was submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The Lord became the source of our salvation through obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>God saved us with the hope that we would submit to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>When one meets God's authority, submission is a simple matter and knowing God's will is also a simple matter, because the Lord, who was submissive throughout His life, has already given us His life of submission.</S>
