If they take this attitude, there will be no service in the church. The first crucial factor in service is to find things to do.</p><h2 class="head2">People</h2><p>Once we create things to do, there is the need to find people to do the things. If the things remain in our hand, the church will not be strong. In order for the church to be strong, the number of serving ones has to be great. The strongest church is one where the entire Body serves. The elders and deacons have to be good at searching out men and perfecting them. In the past we were afraid of people volunteering, suggesting, and acting in a disorderly way. Now we do not have to be afraid; we can deal with them and perfect them with the proper authority.</p><h2 class="head2">Method</h2><p>After we have things and people lined up, we need to find the method or the way. We will do something right only if we have the right way. If we do things impulsively and whimsically according to our own ideas, we will not get the right results. We are most afraid of people exercising their own thoughts and coming up with many ways in their mind. One person does something according to his own preference, while another person does something else according to his own preference. We are afraid of people acting impulsively without giving any thought to what they are doing and without seeking the Lord adequately. Having the right people is not the whole story; we must also find the right way before the Lord. Never act or work in a foolish way.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHARACTER AND WORK OF THE DEACONS</h2><p>Witness Lee: I would still like to fellowship a little from my experience about the character and work of the deacons. The responsibility of receiving leadings from God for the entire church rests on the elders. They have to lead the church to the knowledge of God's will. The execution of this will, however, rests on the shoulders of the deacons. If a church only has strong elders but not strong deacons, its service will not be proper. Hence, the deacons occupy a very important place.</p><p>When the Lord comes back, a group of overcomers will take the lead to reign with Christ for a thousand years (Rev. 20:4, 6). Our exercise and training today is very much related to our reigning tomorrow. Today God is training a group of people so that they can rule in the kingdom in the future. Our exercise and training are not just for today but for the future. Today we are in school; the application will be our service in eternity future. In the coming kingdom the Lord will assign us greater works. The work in God's house will continue. We will not be idle in the coming age (Matt. 25:21; Luke 19:17). Therefore, we cannot be satisfied merely with getting things done. We must take care of a few points.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> </body></html>
