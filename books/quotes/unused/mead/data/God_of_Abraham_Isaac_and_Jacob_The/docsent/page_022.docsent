   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Abraham Justified by Faith</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verses 4 through 6 say, "And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the first time the Bible speaks of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Abraham is the father of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He believed God's word in a definite way, and God counted it to him for righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God told Abraham, "He that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This shows us that God's goal is not achieved through the many people He has gathered, but through those whom He has begotten.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those who are not begotten of God do not count; they cannot fulfill God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's eternal purpose is fulfilled through those whom He has begotten.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God asked Abraham if he could count the stars in heaven and told him that his descendants would be as numerous as the stars.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Abraham believed in God, and God counted it to him for righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As we have mentioned previously, God first had to work on one person and gain something in him before He could gain something through many others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order for God to have many believers, He first had to gain one believer.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Abraham believed in God, and God counted it to him for righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE WAY OF THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to pay attention to the following words: "And he said unto him, I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And he said, Lord God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Gen 15:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the beginning God said to him, "I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But Abraham said to the Lord, "I go childless."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God then told him that only he who came forth out of his own bowels would be his heir, and that his seed would be as the stars in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then he asked God for more proof.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He wanted to know how he could be assured that the land would be his inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Abraham believed God's promise, and God acknowledged his faith.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His question was not a indication of unbelief, but a request for a sign for his faith.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In answering this question, God shows the believers His way of reaching His goal.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How did God answer him?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verses 9 and 10 say, "And he said unto him, Take me a heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 12 says, "And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, a horror of great darkness fell upon him."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verses 17 and 18 say, "And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In that same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This was God's answer.</S>
