   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Today most women dress like men.</S>

   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This signifies that God does not want our acts of righteousness, which are symbolized by clothing, to be something from Christ and something from Adam, that is, a mixture of a spiritual and fleshly living.</S>

   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A cord of blue on the fringe of their garment surrounded their legs and signified that their steps were under the heavenly limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When they saw the cord of blue, they remembered the commandments of God, and they also remembered to not follow their own heart and their own eyes to commit fornication, causing them to be holy to God.</S>
