<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN TEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 10:1-39</h1><p>In the foregoing message we saw from chapter ten the significance of the sheep (vv. 3-5, 27), the sheepfold (vv. 1, 16), the thieves and robbers (vv. 1, 8), and the door of the sheep (vv. 2, 7, 9). Let us now go on to consider other signs in this chapter of the Gospel of John.<h2 class=head1>THE GOOD SHEPHERD</h2><p>The good shepherd is Christ, who laid down His psuche life for His sheep so that they may have the zoe life and may have it abundantly (vv. 2, 10-11, 14-15, 17-18). In 10:11 the Lord Jesus says concerning Himself, “I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.” In verse 14 the Lord goes on to say, “I am the good shepherd, and I know My own, and My own know Me.” As the good Shepherd, the Lord laid down His life on behalf of the sheep. Today the Lord is still our Shepherd.<p>It is important for us to realize that the Lord shepherds us not in the way of outward activity, but that He shepherds us inwardly in the way of life. This means that the Lord shepherds us from within. Inwardly we have Him as our Shepherd, as a Shepherd of life and in life. How does the Lord Jesus shepherd us? He shepherds us in life.<p>Verse 10 proves that the Lord Jesus shepherds us in the way of life: “I came that they may have life and may have it abundantly.” The Lord Jesus is the good Shepherd to impart Himself as life to us. He laid down His psuche life so that the sheep may have His zoe life, and now He is shepherding us in the way of life.<p>We thank the Lord that Christ is our Shepherd and that we all are His sheep. Now we need to see that the Lord shepherds us by being life to us from within. We enjoy His shepherding when we live by Him as our life. On the one hand, the Lord lives in us. On the other hand, we live in Him, by Him, with Him, and through Him. When we live in the Lord in this way, we are under His shepherding. As we are under the Lord’s shepherding, there will be a life consciousness within us and also an instruction, a guidance, in life. The life within us, which is actually Christ Himself, will indicate that the Lord intends to lead us in a certain way. For example, a young brother may want to participate in a certain form of worldly entertainment. However, through the life consciousness within him he may realize that the Lord is not leading him to do that. This life consciousness with its leading and instruction is an indication that this brother is under the Lord’s shepherding.<p>The sisters need to experience Christ’s shepherding in their shopping. Shopping can be perilous. Suppose a sister is eager for the opportunity to go shopping on a coming Saturday. The peril is that in her shopping she may fail to be in Christ and fail to be under His shepherding. Throughout the week this sister may remain under the Lord’s shepherding. But while she is shopping on Saturday she may come out from under this shepherding. Then on the Lord’s Day morning she may struggle to come back to the Lord, seeking mercy and grace from Him. In her shopping she lived in herself and by herself; she did not live in, with, by, and through the Lord. In a very real sense, she was her own shepherd, and shepherded herself in an unruly way.<p>The real Shepherd is the living Christ. As our Shepherd, the Lord not only gives us life—He also is life to us. The living of the Lord within us is actually His living shepherding. Hence, the Lord Jesus shepherds us by being life to us and by living in us.<p>We need to use verse 10 as the key to interpreting every matter in chapter ten. In this verse the Lord says that He came that we may have life, the divine life, and that we may have it abundantly. This life is related to the door, the Shepherd, and the pasture. As long as we have Christ as life within us and we enjoy and experience Him as life, we shall have Him as the door, the Shepherd, and the pasture. The door will be our freedom, and the pasture will be our life supply.<p>The Shepherd, who is life to us, leads us, guides us, and directs us in everything. Therefore, we should not be directed by anything outward, but instead should be directed inwardly by Christ who is life to us. This Christ is our Shepherd, our Guide.
