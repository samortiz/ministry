<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SIX SIGNS IN JOHN 1</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 1:1-5, 14, 16-18, 29, 36, 32-33, 41-42, 12-13, 51</h1><p>In this message we shall consider the significance of the six signs in John 1. These signs are the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house of God.<h2 class=head1>I. THE WORD</h2><p>The Word is eternal; that is, it is self-existing, without beginning (Heb. 7:3). This is contrary to the heretical teaching that says the Word, the Logos, was created by God. According to the revelation in John’s Gospel, the Word was not created. However, the Word became flesh (John 1:14), and the flesh is a created element. John 1:1 says that the Word was in the beginning. This reveals that the Word is eternal. Then John 1:14 says that the Word became flesh, something created by God. By this we may say that John reconciles the schools of thought that say respectively that Christ was God and not man and that He was man and not God. This is the reason some teachers say that John’s writings are conciliatory. As we pointed out in the foregoing message, we prefer to say that the writings of John are all-inclusive. John reveals that, on the one hand, the Word is eternal, uncreated, but that, on the other hand, He became flesh, something created by God.<p>The Word is living, a divine Person, Christ the Son of the living God (Rev. 19:13). The eternal Word is our Lord Jesus Christ, and the living Word is also He. Furthermore, Christ is the written Word, the holy writings, the Bible (Heb. 10:7; Luke 24:27, 44). Christ is also the spoken Word, the rhema, the instant word to be spirit and life to man (John 6:63). Therefore, Christ is the eternal Word, the living Word, the written Word, and the spoken Word. Such a Word signifies the mysterious and invisible God defined and expressed. Concerning this, John 1:18 says, “No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.” Also, according to Hebrews 1:3, Christ is the effulgence of God’s glory and the express image of His substance. As the Word, Christ is the definition and expression of God. Therefore, He could say, “He who has seen Me has seen the Father” (John 14:9).<p>Through the Word all things came into existence (1:3; Heb. 11:3). According to John 1:4 and 5, in Him are the divine life (God imparted) and the divine light (God shining).<h2 class=head1>II. THE TABERNACLE</h2><p>John 1:14 says, “The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.” This incarnated Word is a tabernacle. This tabernacle signifies the Word becoming flesh as God’s expression. Here the word “expression” is the same in significance as the gold in the tabernacle. The tabernacle was built with boards of acacia wood overlaid with gold. Anyone who entered the tabernacle would see the shining gold, the gold that signifies God expressed. When Christ was on earth, there was a certain kind of shining with Him. That shining is the expression of God, which is typified by the gold of the tabernacle. Eventually, we also shall be overlaid with shining gold.<p>As the tabernacle, Christ, the incarnated Word, shared in humanity. For the Word to become flesh means that the Word took on human nature. Humanity is typified by the acacia wood of the tabernacle (Exo. 26:15, 29). The shining gold and the acacia wood signify respectively the divine nature of Christ and His human nature, His humanity.<p>As the tabernacle, Christ is God’s embodiment. Colossians 2:9 says, “For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.” Not only was the Father embodied in Christ, but the fullness of the Godhead was embodied in Him. This means that the fullness of the Godhead was embodied in the tabernacle. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit were embodied in the tabernacle, and this embodiment is God’s dwelling among men.<p>The fullness of the Godhead was embodied in the tabernacle so that man can enter into God and enjoy Him. Originally, God was mysterious, invisible, and untouchable. But now God has been embodied in a tabernacle that can be entered, one that we may call an enterable tabernacle. This means that God is enterable; we can enter into Him and enjoy Him. Once we enter into God, we may say that we can walk around in Him to enjoy Him. We may enjoy Him as our life supply, signified by the bread on the showbread table, and as our light, signified by the lampstand. In particular, we may enjoy Him as the ark. Then we may abide at the incense altar not only to commune with Him, but also to intercede for His eternal purpose. How marvelous!<p>Our God today is different from the God of the Jews. In a sense, He is even somewhat different from the God experienced by many Christians. The God we experience and enjoy in the Lord’s recovery is the One revealed in the Bible. Hallelujah, our God is enterable, and we can enjoy Him!<p>With the tabernacle we have grace (God enjoyed) and reality (God realized). John 1:16 and 17 say, “For of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace. For the law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.” Grace is the enjoyment of God for man, and reality is the realization of God for man. Therefore, grace is God enjoyed by man, and reality is God realized by man. When we enter into the tabernacle, we may enjoy the bread, the light, and the ark. All this is grace. What grace we enjoy at the showbread table and at the lampstand! We especially enjoy grace at the ark, with the hidden manna and the cherubim. As we are enjoying God, we fully realize Him. He becomes our life supply, our light, our hidden manna, our budding rod, and our law. What a marvelous reality this is!<p>The tabernacle in John 1:14 is just a beginning. This tabernacle will consummate in the eternal tabernacle in the new heaven and the new earth (Rev. 21:2-3). The entire Bible consummates in one item—the tabernacle. Revelation 21 says that the New Jerusalem is the tabernacle of God. The tabernacle we have today will have a consummation, and the consummate tabernacle will be the New Jerusalem.
