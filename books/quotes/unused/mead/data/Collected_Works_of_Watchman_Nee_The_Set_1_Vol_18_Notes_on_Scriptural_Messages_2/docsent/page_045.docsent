   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S WARNING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Lot's tent was gradually pitched "toward Sodom."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What danger did he run into?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Genesis 14:9-12 four kings went to war with five.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"And the vale of Siddim was full of slime pits; and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that remained fled to the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their victuals, and went their way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods, and departed" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This war was between two forces: five kings were defeated by four kings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lot and his goods were also captured.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Lot was captured because he dwelt in Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The last time we saw him, he was still outside the city; but now he was dwelling in the city.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The last time someone saw you, you might have still looked like a Christian; but now you have become a citizen of Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more sins you commit, the closer you are to Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After a while, you will feel that the country is not as good as the city.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As time goes on, you will even feel that the plain is not as good as the city.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Lot's residing in Sodom was not without God's warning.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the five kings were defeated by the four kings, Lot was also captured.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This was a warning God gave to Lot that Sodom was not the place to be.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today I will ask you most frankly; this is also my word to you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If someone is sick, meets with failures in his business, or has problems in his family, these all are probably warnings from God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The defeat of the five kings by the four kings was God's warning to Lot not to dwell in Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Lot's tent was gradually pitched "toward Sodom."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Later he even became a citizen of Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The way Lot moved was a little today, a little tomorrow, a little this time, and a little more the next time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After a few moves, he eventually moved into the city.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, God gave Lot a warning.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What about us today?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Perhaps some experience the death of their spouse or the death of their son, and perhaps some become sick or meet with business failures.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God's warning might be in these happenings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you are a Christian, yet drawing closer to the world day by day, God will warn you and give you no peace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God gives you His warning so that you will turn back quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is a pity that many Christians have no feelings; they cannot feel pain.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even though they realize that they are sick, that they have business failures, and that their families have problems, they do not know that these are God's scourging.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As a result, they will not turn back.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, if they do not turn back, greater things will happen to them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There was a brother, who though not yet backsliding, was gradually losing his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Another brother advised him one day that he should not go on in that manner anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He answered, "It does not matter.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Mr. So-and-so was very zealous at first, then he gradually lost his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This year at the age of sixty, his oldest son who had just graduated from college died suddenly, and the old man has now become zealous again."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The one who advised him then said, "God will most certainly accomplish things according to your wish."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He said, "I certainly do not want this."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Friends, if you belong to God, and if your feet walk toward the sinful world, God will certainly discipline you.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you are sick, and if you experience family problems or business failure, you should inquire of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If God says that these things have happened to you because you have forsaken Him, you should turn back.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many times if the love of God cannot draw us, He will scourge us with a whip.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If God's word cannot touch us, He will press us with adversity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you belong to the Lord and have committed sin or become backslidden, God will most certainly discipline you.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He will not let you go.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Fortunately, Lot was rescued by his uncle when he was captured.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Lot first dwelt outside of the city and was only close to Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A person may still act like a Christian; he may not have moved into the city, but he is touching Sodom, and the boundary line is still very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But what happened at the end?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He finally moved into the city.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I will illustrate by a story.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There was a child whose mother gave him six candies and told him to save them and eat them the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The child put the candies in front of him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He wanted to eat them but dared not to.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Yet he could not bear the thought of not eating them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What did he do?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He put each candy on his lip and licked it with his tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In this way, he licked all six candies again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>At first there were six candies.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Later they became smaller one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>After a while one was gone, and five remained.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>And then two were gone, and four remained.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the end all six were eaten up.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is the way many Christians fall into sins.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They disobey their conscience once, twice, until gradually they seek happiness in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Brothers and sisters, please realize that one does not stop sinning after the first sin.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Once a person commits one sin, an addiction is built up which will cause him to commit sin again next time.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Every time a person commits a sin, there are two results: first, it affords one the pleasure of sin; second, it builds up an addiction to commit more sin.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Lot moved into the city gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Is it possible for you not to go into the city?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>At the beginning, we think that we will only commit that much sin and not go into the city.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But there is no such thing.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If you reach the entrance of Sodom, you will certainly go into the city.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Either you do not sin or you sin.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If you sin, you will not have the power to restrict yourself to that one sin and avoid committing more sins.</S>
