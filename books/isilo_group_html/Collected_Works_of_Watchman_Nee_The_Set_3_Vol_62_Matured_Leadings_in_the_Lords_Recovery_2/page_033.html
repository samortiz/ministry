A hymn is the expression of a person's spiritual sentiments. When a man expresses his spiritual sentiments in songs, many times his mind is not very clear, but his spirit is clear. For example in Hymns, #974, it is unclear whether the "he" refers to the Lord, to Abraham, or to us. They are all mixed together. Whatever it may be, we can touch the spirit of this hymn.</p><h2 class="head1">HANDING OVER TO RUN THE CHRISTIAN RACE</h2><p>After you have believed in the Lord, you have to deal with two things. The first is sin. Formerly, sin followed and entangled you. You were not able to free yourself from sin. Once you believed in the Lord, your sinful acts were forgiven. Now you must also deal with sin itself so that you can be free from its domination. The second category includes things that should be terminated. You have to deal with all the things you have acquired from the world. Some of these things relate to sin. Others are not related to sin, but are a burden and hindrance to running the Christian race. All these have to be dealt with and cleared up. Hebrews 12:1-2 says that in running the race, a Christian must first put away every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles him. No one runs a race wearing an overcoat and dress shoes. No one runs with things in his hands. In the same way, after a man believes in the Lord, he has to sell everything, forsake all, and remove every hindrance to run the race before him.</p><p>How do we deal with the things that are still in our hands? When men went to John the Baptist to ask what they should do, he replied, "He who has two tunics, let him share with the one who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise" (Luke 3:11). Anything that we owe others should be returned with recompense. If we have acquired our fortune by unjust means, it is wrong to keep it. It is equally wrong to spend it. We have to deal with it in a clear way. Everything that we own and everything in our house must be dealt with and cleaned up thoroughly. If a Christian wants to run the race before him, he has to deal immediately with the many burdens that entangle him. Forsaking everything is not only an expression of our love for the Lord; it is mainly for the purpose of preparing us to run our Christian race properly.</p><p>We know that a man cannot be a Christian if sin remains in him. But if many material things remain in him, he cannot be a Christian either. Sin in us will hinder us from living a proper Christian life. In principle, material things remaining with us also will hinder us from living a proper Christian life. Sin makes us sick organically; material things make us sick functionally.</p><p>Things that the brothers and sisters own, such as gold, silver, precious items, jewelry, etc., must be handed over. Concerning the lands and houses that the saints have handed over, there should be suitable arrangements and proper disposition. Many Christians have lived loosely and carelessly in the past. Today they can no longer be so reckless. In these days, the brothers and sisters must be very busy. We all must learn to be absolute and strict Christians.</p><p>We believe that the church is beginning to take the final step of God's recovery. May we do well in this way. Thank the Lord that He has put us in this rich age.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 62: Matured Leadings in the Lord's Recovery (2) &nbsp; pg 33</div><br></body></html>
