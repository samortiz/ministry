   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Seven Men Full of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Acts 6 the apostles encountered a problem related to language and race.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They exercised their wisdom to solve the problem and to take care of all the different saints.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Acts 6:2 says, And the twelve, having called the multitude of the disciples to them, said, It is not fitting for us to leave the word of God to serve tables.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here we see that in the church life some things are major and others are minor.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To minister the word and pray are major matters, but to serve tables is a minor matter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In verses 3 and 4 the apostles went on to say, Now brothers, select seven well-attested men from among you, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we shall appoint over this need.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Greek word for full in verse 3 is pleres, an adjective form of pleroo, according to the usage here and in 6:5; 7:55; 11:24; and Luke 4:1.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Full of the Spirit is one s condition after being filled with the Spirit inwardly and essentially, as mentioned in 13:52.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This refers to life, not to work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The word wisdom in 6:3 also indicates that in this verse to be full of the Spirit is for life, as in Luke 2:52.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verse 4 the apostles said that they would continue in prayer and in the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To pray is not only to entreat the Lord to do things for His move, but also to cause our spirit to be exercised and to be strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, prayer should precede the word just as the apostles practiced.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Without such prayer, the ministry may not be enlivened and empowered.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The apostles told the multitude to select seven well-attested men from among them to be appointed over the need.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verses 5 and 6 say, And the word pleased all the multitude, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch, whom they set before the apostles; and having prayed, they laid their hands on them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Since these seven were chosen to serve tables, they may be considered deacons, just as those whom Paul and his co-workers appointed later in the churches Rom 16:1; Phil 1:1; 1 Tim 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to verse 6 the apostles laid their hands on the seven serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Bible laying on of hands has two functions: one for identification, as in Leviticus 1:4; and the other for impartation, as in 1 Timothy 4:14.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A Pattern for Us Today</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because Peter and the other apostles bore the responsibility of ministering the word, they distributed the serving of tables to other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a pattern we need to follow today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to this pattern, we should not keep all the responsibilities on our own shoulders, but distribute the responsibilities to all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is an important principle.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have learned much from the pattern in Acts, and we have been following this pattern in the church life for more than fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Allow me to testify concerning my experience of distributing responsibilities to others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some may think that I am capable and able to do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Actually, I am not unusually capable.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, I have learned to distribute responsibility to other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For example, the Lord blessed the work in Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When it was time for me to leave that city, it was very easy to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There was no need to talk to the brothers about the work, the church service, and other things, because I had learned not to keep matters in my hands.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For years, the things concerning the church and the work had been distributed to the saints, and they were bearing the responsibility for these things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, when the time came for me to leave, I simply left.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I had a similar experience in the church in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some had the concept that many things related to the church were in my hands.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Actually, that was not the situation at all.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When I received word from Brother Nee that I should leave Mainland China, I left within a couple of days.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The things in the church had been distributed to the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This has also been my practice in the church life in this country.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you inquire of the brothers who know the history among us, they will be able to tell you that I have not kept the matters of the church to myself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Once again, I have had the practice of distributing the responsibility to others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For this reason, there are many things concerning the local churches that I do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you ask me about these things, I would refer you to the elders or to the church service office.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>My point here is that by the Lord s mercy we have learned to distribute responsibility to others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to our human nature, we either do not care at all to do certain things, or we want to do those things in such a way that all the matters related to them are in our pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At first, our pocket may be flat.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But eventually it will become filled with things that we reserved for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, I would emphasize the need for us to learn to distribute responsibility to others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>First, we may give a responsibility to a certain brother.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then we shall give a different responsibility to another brother.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This distribution of responsibility is needed for the spread of the Lord s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To those who think that I am especially capable and have carried on a great work throughout the world I would say this: Please do not think that I am so capable.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I have only done a little.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You need to give credit to all the saints, who have done many things and carried much responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I have only done my portion.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Like the apostles in Acts, may we all learn to do our portion and to distribute the responsibility for other things to all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need to see that whatever is recorded in Acts is a pattern for us to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the initiation of the church life we have the pattern of distributing responsibilities to others.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The appointing of the seven serving ones to care for the particular need is a very good pattern, and we need to follow it in the church life today.</S>
