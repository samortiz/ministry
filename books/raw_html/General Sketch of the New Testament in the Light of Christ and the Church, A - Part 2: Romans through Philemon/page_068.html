<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</h1><h1 class=msg>FAITH, LOVE, AND HOPE IN 1 AND 2 THESSALONIANS</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Thes. 1:10; 2:19-20; 3:13; 4:17-18; 5:23; 2 Thes. 2:1-8; 1 Thes. 1:3; 2 Thes. 1:3; 1 Tim. 1:5; 2 Pet. 1:1, 3-7</h1><p>Among all the Epistles written by the apostle Paul, the two to the Thessalonians are the simplest, and they are among the earliest. Why then are these two Epistles placed toward the end of his fourteen Epistles in the arrangement of the New Testament? I believe that the sovereignty of God is in this arrangement.<p>In the previous messages of this series we have seen a full definition of the universal man. We have clearly and thoroughly seen Christ as the Head, the church as the Body, and the way that the members of this Body should walk and live. Now after the definition of the universal man in the foregoing books of the New Testament, 1 and 2 Thessalonians show us an additional matter, the coming of the Lord. These two books are found at this juncture because the second coming of Christ is the consummation of the life of the universal man. Christ’s coming is the consummation of the Christian life, the Christian walk, and the church life.<h2 class=head1>A BALANCED VIEW OF THE LORD’S SECOND COMING</h2><p>These two books are arranged in a very meaningful order. Since both speak about the coming of the Lord, why is there the need of two books to relate this matter? Why is one epistle not adequate? One of the best ways to study the Word is to compare two books, two chapters, two passages, two verses, or even two words. With all the matters revealed in the Scripture, there are always two aspects, two sides. It is a principle that for anything in the universe to exist, it must have two sides. Nothing can exist with only one side. Even a thin piece of paper has two sides. For example, there are the heavens and the earth, God and man, man and woman, inside and outside, and top and bottom. In our own physical body, most of its members are in pairs. We have two ears, two eyes, two arms, two hands, two legs, and so forth. This provides balance. If we had only one leg, we could not stand for long because we would lack balance. Medical doctors tell us that our two ears are also for balance.<p>The two books to the Thessalonians show us the coming of the Lord in a balanced way. The first book encourages the saints by the coming of the Lord. The coming of the Lord means very much to us. It is our hope, our encouragement, our comfort, and our strength. To those early Christians also, the Lord’s second coming meant very much. However, whenever we are encouraged by a hope, it is easy to go too far. We may say that since the Lord will come tomorrow, we can forget about everything else. This is wrong, unbalanced, and to an extreme. Therefore, we need the second epistle to tell us the other side. Hence, the second epistle is a balance to the first one. This is the main reason that there are two epistles concerning the Lord’s coming. If we read them carefully, we will see the balance.
