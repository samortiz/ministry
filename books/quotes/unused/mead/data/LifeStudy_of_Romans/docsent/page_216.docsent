   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ROMANS MESSAGE SIXTY-THREE NOT AN EXCHANGED LIFE,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BUT A GRAFTED LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God s economy is a matter of the dispensing of the divine life into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As a result of this dispensation, we, the chosen people of God, have both the human life and the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every kind of life, even the lowest plant life, is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No scientist can fully explain how a little seed grows into a beautiful flower.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Within the seed there is an element of life that brings forth a flower with a certain shape and color.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE MOST WONDERFUL CREATED LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Among the various forms of created life, the most wonderful is the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Contrary to the opinion of many, the angelic life is not more wonderful than the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is wrong to think that angelic life is better than human life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God did not ordain the angelic life to contain the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather, He created the human life to be the vessel for the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although you may consider yourself inferior to the angels, God considers you better than angels.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nevertheless, subconsciously some, especially sisters, may desire to be angels.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Bible, however, does not speak of God s love for angels, but it reveals His love for man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Angels are simply God s servants.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In His eyes, the most wonderful life among all His creatures is the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Genesis 1:26 says, And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, the angels were not created in the image and likeness of God, but man was.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do you realize that you were made in the image of God and according to God s likeness?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are not descendants of apes, but are descendants of the man created in the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Simply by having the image of God and by bearing the likeness of God, we look like God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the clear revelation in the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because man was created according to God, the human life is the best of all created lives.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, we can be proud of the fact that we are human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Praise the Lord that we are men and not angels!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>IMAGE, LIKENESS, AND REALITY</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One day, through the incarnation of Christ, God Himself became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this way God identified Himself with man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Jesus, God incarnate, was both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The incarnation of Christ not only brought God down to man s level, but it also uplifted man to God s level.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By creation man had both the image of God and the likeness of God, but he did not have in him the reality of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The incarnation brought the reality of God into man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord Jesus had not only God s image and likeness; He also embodied the reality of God, for God was in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In principle, the same is true of everyone who has been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As regenerated persons, we not only bear the image of God and have the likeness of God, but we also have within us the reality of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A VESSEL TO CONTAIN GOD</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Bible reveals that man was created as a vessel to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In 9:21 Paul speaks of vessels to honor and in 9:23, of vessels of mercy prepared unto glory.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God Himself is the real honor and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, the fact that we are vessels to honor prepared unto glory means that we have been designed to contain God as our honor and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We may use a glove as an illustration of man as a vessel, a container, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because the purpose of a glove is to contain the hand, the glove is made in the likeness of the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The hand has a thumb and four fingers, and the glove also has a thumb and four fingers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although the glove is not the hand, it is made in the likeness of the hand in order to contain the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the same principle, man is a vessel to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For this reason, he was made according to the likeness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you put your hand into a glove designed for it, your hand will feel comfortable in the glove.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In like manner, God feels comfortable in man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, He would not feel comfortable in an animal or even in an angel.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Only in man does God feel at home, at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Heaven may be God s temporary dwelling place, but His real home is man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are all gloves designed to contain God as the divine hand.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We were made in a form that is suitable to be the place of God s dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God has a mind, a will, and emotions, and we do too.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As humans, we should not be jellyfish, beings without a strong will.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A proper human being must not only have a mind and a will, but also be full of emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should find it easy to laugh or to weep.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should not be like statues incapable of expressing feeling no matter what the situation may be.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Bible reveals that God is rich in emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He hates, He loves, and He becomes angry.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>According to John 11:35, the Lord Jesus, God incarnate, wept.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, to be a vessel to contain God, man was created with emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Emotion is extremely important, for God Himself is rich in emotion; He is not a God of stone.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>All of man s virtues are created according to God s attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>For example, human kindness is an image of God s kindness.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The same is true of gentleness.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Man s gentleness is according to the likeness of the gentleness of God.</S>
