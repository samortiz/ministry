   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE FLESHLY CHRISTIAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Every believer can, like Paul, be filled with the Holy Spirit at the time he believes and is baptized Acts 9:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, many believers do not truly believe as an accomplished fact that Christ has died and been resurrected for them, nor do they sincerely apply in practice the principle of death and resurrection which they are called by the Holy Spirit to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, they still remain subject to the control of the flesh, just like those who have not died and been resurrected, although in fact, they have died and been resurrected according to what has been accomplished by Christ, and they should die to themselves and live to God according to their duty as disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This type of believer may be said to be abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But abnormal believers are not found only today; they were already in existence at the time of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Corinthians are a case in point, as we may see from what Paul said to them:</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to fleshy, as to infants in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, for you were not yet able to receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But neither yet now are you able, for you are still fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For if there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly and do you not walk according to the manner of man?"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>1 Cor 3:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Here the apostle divides all Christians into two categories: the spiritual and the carnal or fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Truly spiritual Christians are in no way extraordinary Christians; they are simply normal.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is rather that the fleshly Christians are the extraordinary ones for they are in reality abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Corinthians were already Christians, but they were not spiritual; rather, they were fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Three times in this chapter of the Bible the apostle said they were fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The apostle knew through the wisdom bestowed on him by the Holy Spirit that he should first know to which group they actually belonged before he could determine what the doctrinal truth was that should be ministered to them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the light of the Scriptures, regeneration is a birth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When one is regenerated, the spirit that lies hidden in the innermost part, the deepest part, of his being is renewed and indwelt by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, time is needed for the power of this new life to extend outward from the center to the circumference.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, we cannot expect a babe in Christ to have the strength of the "young men" or the experience of the "fathers."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the case of a newly regenerated believer, even if he loves the Lord to the uttermost, is very fervent in his service, and goes on most faithfully with the Lord, time must still be given him so as to afford him the opportunities to better recognize the detestfulness of sin and self and to better understand God's will and way in the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Of course, among these believers there are often some who really do love the Lord with exceeding fervor and greatly delight in the truth, but this still is nothing more than the operation of the emotion and the mind, untested by fire, and consequently not lasting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In any case, it is unavoidable for a newly regenerated believer to remain fleshly because he does not know the flesh even though he is filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One cannot eliminate the works of the flesh if he does not realize that these works are the products of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, in reality many newly born believers are truly of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Bible does not expect a Christian who has just believed in the Lord to immediately become spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, if he makes no progress whatever for years, or even for decades, and stays in the position of a babe, this is not proper, and his case is most pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After speaking about babes in Christ being of the flesh, the apostle proceeds to state that those who have remained as babes for a long time are also of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Of course, this is so.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Prior to that, Paul considered the Corinthian believers as being of the flesh, as being babes in Christ, but even at that time they were still of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By that time they should have grown into adulthood, but on the contrary they had withered away, so much so that they remained babes.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Consequently, they were still fleshly believers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The time required for a believer to progress from the state of being fleshly to the state of being spiritual is not so long as some imagine today.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although not many years had passed since the Corinthian believers had become Christians, the apostle already considered them to have been babes for too long, to have been of the flesh for too long.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He expected them to have long since become spiritual!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The purpose of Christ's redemption is to remove all hindrances that the Holy Spirit may take full control of one's entire being and make him spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Such redemption can never fail, nor is the power of the Holy Spirit ordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As a fleshly sinner can become a regenerated believer, so can a regenerated believer who is still fleshly become spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What is most pitiful is that among the present-day believers there are some who have remained as babes not merely for several years but have continued to remain in their old selves for decades without any progress whatever.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Moreover, even though there are some who are able to progress into a spiritual life in a few years, they are very surprised, thinking that this is unusual.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Little do they know that this is normal nothing more than normal regular growth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Readers, how many years have you believed in the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>And have you become spiritual?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should not become aged babes, thereby causing grief to the Holy Spirit and bringing loss to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As regenerated believers we should yearn for a completely spiritual life, and in everything we should let the Holy Spirit be the Lord and Master so that He may in the least possible time lead us into what God has prepared for us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On no account should we waste our time, making no progress at all.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We can trace the reasons that a person remains a babe so long without any growth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Generally speaking, there are two reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One reason is that those who watch over the believers only pay attention to the grace of God and the position of the believers in Christ without encouraging them to pursue spiritual experience, or these overseers, not knowing the life in the Holy Spirit, are unable to lead those whom they watch over into a more abundant life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The other reason is that the believers themselves show little interest in the things of the Spirit, thinking that it is good enough merely to be saved; or they do not hunger and thirst after the things of the Spirit; or, after knowing the prerequisites, they are unwilling to pay the price because it is too high.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Due to these causes, there are many such old babes in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What are the characteristics of a fleshly person?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The first is remaining as a babe for a long time Heb 5:11-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The period of babyhood should not exceed a few years at the very most.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A person is regenerated because he believes in the redemption accomplished for him by the Son of God on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When he so believes, he should also believe that he has been crucified with the Savior and thus allow the Holy Spirit to release and deliver him from the power of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Ignorant of this principle, he will inevitably remain fleshly for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The second characteristic of a fleshly person is the inability to receive spiritual teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>"Brothers...I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, for you were not yet able to receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But neither yet now are you able."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Corinthians boasted of their great and lofty knowledge and wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>So far as we know, the church at Corinth was possibly the most knowledgeable of all the churches at the time.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They were "enriched in...all knowledge" 1:5 , and on that account Paul gave thanks to God for them.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If Paul had then spoken to them the spiritual truths, they would have been able to understand every word.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But all that they had would have only been in the mind!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Although they had knowledge of all things, they did not have the power to express what they knew in their practical lives.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Perhaps today there are many fleshly believers who know quite a few doctrines and may be able to impart spiritual truths to others, but they themselves are still not spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>True spiritual knowledge consists not of wonderful and profound thoughts but of such practical experience as may be gained in the spirit as a result of a union of the believer's life with truth.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Intelligence is of no avail, nor is it enough to have a fervent desire for the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Rather, one must have a life that is completely obedient to the Holy Spirit before he can hope to be taught by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Otherwise, it is merely a case of conveying thoughts from one mind to another.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Knowledge of this kind cannot make a fleshly person spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>On the contrary, his fleshly life will cause his knowledge to also become fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>What is lacking in this kind of person is not more spiritual teaching the apostle felt that this hardly needed to be mentioned , but an obedient heart that is willing to submit one's life to the Holy Spirit, obey His command, and take the way of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>To such a person, spiritual knowledge only strengthens his carnality and helps him to deceive himself into thinking that he is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>"Otherwise, how could I know so many spiritual things?"</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>"But how many of the things you know are things you have learned from your daily life, and how many are just things you thought of in your mind?"</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>May God be gracious to us!</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>There is another strong evidence of being fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>"For you are still fleshly."</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>What is the reason?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>"For if there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly and do you not walk according to the manner of man?"</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>1 Cor 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The sins of envy and strife are evidences of being carnal.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>There was strife within the church at Corinth, and the believers variously claimed, "I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ" 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Although there were some who contended for Christ, saying, "I am of Christ," this also was the work of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The disposition of the flesh is that of envy and contention.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>To exalt Christ in this kind of disposition is also of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Hence, any sectarian boasting is, at its very best, merely the babbling of babies.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The divisions within the church are due to no other reasons except the lack of love and the walking according to the flesh, as what God has said here.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Contending for the truth is only a pretext.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Sinners of the world are men of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Since they are not regenerated, they have their soul and body as their masters.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Hence, they are of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If a believer is also of the flesh, then he is walking after the manner of men.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Men of the world are naturally fleshly, and therefore, it may be excusable for a newly regenerated person to be of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>But since according to the years you have believed in the Lord you ought to have long since been spiritual, why are you still walking after the manner of men?</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>To fail and sin frequently after the manner of men is an indication that a man is of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If a believer still cannot overcome his temper and his peculiar temperament and is still selfish, contentious, vainly emulative, unforgiving of others' trespasses, and short of love in speaking, then he is truly still of the flesh, regardless of how many spiritual truths he knows, how much spiritual experience he thinks he has gained, or how fervently and effectively he has worked.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Being carnal or fleshly means nothing other than to "walk according to the manner of men."</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We should ask ourselves if we have completely ceased to walk after the manner of men.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>If there are still many things in our life that bear the semblance of the worldly people, then we are still of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We should not dispute over a term as to whether we are spiritual or fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>If we are not governed by the Holy Spirit, what profit is there even if we are called spiritual?</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>This is a question of life, not of name.</S>
