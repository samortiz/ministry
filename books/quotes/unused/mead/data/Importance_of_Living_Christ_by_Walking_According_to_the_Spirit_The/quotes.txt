[1]  The Importance of Living Christ by Walking According to the Spirit CONTENTS
[2]  Living according to the Vision of the Central Lane of Paul s Completing Ministry
[3]  I believe that the revelation and vision concerning God s eternal purpose in the central lane of Paul s completing ministry has never been opened as thoroughly and as clearly as it has been opened today among us.
[4]  WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Phil 1:21; Gal 2:20; Rom 8:4 NEEDING TO WALK ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT
[5]  Recently, based on Romans 8:4, we have seen the matter of walking according to the spirit, which is the practical way to live Christ.
[6]  As elders, we may help the saints to preach the gospel and exercise their spirits in the meetings, but our primary concern should be to help them to live Christ by walking according to the spirit in their daily life.
[7]  If we are honest, we will humble ourselves before the Lord and repent to Him for our lack of walking according to the spirit in our daily life.
[8]  However, if the elders in a locality take the lead to walk according to the spirit, and they minister such a life to the other saints, the saints in that locality will also walk according to the spirit and regularly preach the gospel.
[9]  Question: In my experience the most enjoyable times have been times of corporately seeking the Lord.
[10]  How does the matter of living Christ relate to the corporate experience of Christ?
[11]  Answer: The corporate aspect of the Christian life is certainly helpful, but what we often lack is a daily life of walking according to the spirit.
[12]  The saints in a local church may experience a high corporate life for a time, but if they do not enter into the practice of walking according to the spirit, their enjoyment will eventually diminish.
[13]  Today we need to enter into the actual practice of walking according to the spirit, and as leading ones, we need to help others to balance their corporate enjoyment of the Lord with a personal daily life of walking according to the spirit.
[14]  Question: Many times I have experienced being led by the Spirit to do something, but while I am doing it, I am not walking according to the spirit or living Christ.
[15]  We may have this teaching and perhaps even this revelation and vision, but we must admit that we do not adequately have this living, even if we say and do many good things.
[16]  The Spirit is in our spirit, forming a mingled spirit, and when we walk according to this mingled spirit, life is imparted to our spirit, mind, and body vv.
[17]  That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit.
[18]  For those who are according to the flesh mind the things of the flesh; but those who are according to the spirit, the things of the Spirit.
[19]  So then, brothers, we are debtors not to the flesh to live according to the flesh; for if you live according to the flesh, you must die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live.
[20]  However, we mainly need to see that the focus of Romans 8 and of the Bible is nothing other than God s desire to live in us so that we may live Him.
[21]  The thought that God wants to live in us so that we may live Him may seem strange to us, even if we have studied the Bible, because this thought is new to our mind.
[22]  The Spirit is not only the Spirit of God but also God Himself.
[23]  The virtues taught by Confucius are the development of our natural God-created humanity, but the virtues taught in the New Testament are the issue of God living in us and our living God.
[24]  Although we have known and taught for years that Christ is the reality of every virtue, we need to realize that this is a matter of God living in us and our living Him.
[25]  The church life is not a matter of whether we are right or wrong but a matter of whether we are living ourselves or living God.
[26]  If we walk according to the flesh, we branch out Adam, but if we walk according to the spirit, we branch out God.
[27]  In a sense, it is difficult to know when we are walking according to the spirit, but it is easy to know when we are not walking according to the spirit.
[28]  CHAPTER FIVE THE TRIUNE GOD LIVING IN THE BELIEVERS SO THAT THEY MAY LIVE HIM 3 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 4:5; 8:1-2, 4, 6-7, 9; 1 Cor 15:10; Gal 2:20; Matt 20:26-27; 23:11-12; 1 Tim 1:3 GRACE, WHICH IS THE TRIUNE GOD
[29]  The central lane of the divine revelation in the Bible is the Triune God living in the believers so that they may live Him.
[30]  Nevertheless, we all have to see one thing that the goal of the Lord s recovery is to recover Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God to be our life and who is the Spirit to live within us and make us His living members so that His Body will be built up on the earth.
[31]  Therefore, many brothers need to participate, but we must be vigilant lest we be distracted from the central revelation that the Triune God desires to live in us so that we may live Him.
[32]  OF THE LOCAL CHURCHES Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 14:33b; 2 Cor 4:5; Rev 1:1, 9; Matt 23:11-12; 1 Pet 5:1-3 THE CHURCHES BELONGING
[33]  First Peter 5:1-2 says, The elders among you I exhort, who am a fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ, who am also a partaker of the glory to be revealed: Shepherd the flock of God among you, overseeing not under compulsion but willingly, according to God; not by seeking gain through base means but eagerly.
[34]  CHAPTER SEVEN LIVING THE BODY LIFE 1 Scripture Reading: Rom 8:4; 12:4-5 THE BODY LIFE ISSUING FROM
[35]  The Body of Christ in Romans 12 issues from the experience of walking according to the spirit in Romans 8.
[36]  According to Paul s view of God s economy, all the members of the Body of Christ should be persons who walk according to the spirit.
[37]  In principle, if we do not walk according to the spirit, we cannot practically have the Body of Christ.
[38]  By the Lord s mercy, the situation in the Lord s recovery is somewhat better, yet we have to admit that even among us the Body life is lacking.
[39]  The exercise of the spirit to sing, pray, and speak in the meetings helps the saints to live the Body life, but we need to realize that these things themselves are not the Body life.
[40]  What is needed in the Lord s recovery is a daily living of walking according to the spirit.
[41]  Because we are all members of the Body of Christ and have Christ as our Head, it is a shame if we need elders to regulate us.
[42]  If a local church is a miniature of the New Jerusalem with all the saints walking according to the spirit, the elders would not have much to do.
[43]  When the seven Spirits are present, all the titles and positions are gone v. 4 . In Revelation we do not see apostles, elders, and deacons but the seven Spirits, enlightening the churches as the lampstands 3:1; 4:5; 1:20 . Every local church should be a shining lampstand enlightened by the seven Spirits, not ruled by elders.
[44]  Prayer: Lord, we pray for the churches in Your recovery.
[45]  Then as we walk according to the spirit v. 4 , life spreads from our spirit to our mind, which represents our soul v. 6 . If we allow the Spirit of the Triune God to indwell us, to occupy us, life will eventually spread to our mortal body.
[46]  If we walk according to the spirit, our spirit, soul, and body will be free from sin and death and full of life, and our body will be qualified to be presented to God.
[47]  After Romans 12:1 exhorts us to present our freed and enlivened bodies to God for the Body life, verse 2 deals with our soul, represented by the mind.
[48]  It says, Be transformed by the renewing of the mind that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and well pleasing and perfect.
[49]  2-11 , and Romans 12 shows that in order to be used by God for the Body of Christ, we must first present our body, then have our mind renewed, and lastly be burning in the spirit vv.
[50]  When we walk according to the spirit and have an enlivened body, a renewed mind, and a burning spirit, we will be prepared for the Body life and function properly in the Body life.
[51]  If we drink of the Spirit, we will embrace every member, especially the weaker and despised ones.
[52]  CHAPTER NINE LIVING THE BODY LIFE 3 Scripture Reading: Eph 4; Col 2
[53]  In the Body life, because we walk according to the spirit and drink of the Spirit, the natural life is terminated, the natural strength is not used, and the natural way is altogether put aside Rom 8:4; 1 Cor 12:13 .
[54]  Until we reach the stage of the Body life, we still live in the natural life and use our natural strength, way, and wisdom quite often.
[55]  We thank the Lord that the church is different from society, but we have to admit that sometimes we are not pure in our motive, intention, and action.
[56]  Even if we think that we have a pure motive and do not want to damage others, we are still not pure if we take the natural way.
[57]  However, it is difficult for us not to be natural until we reach the stage of the Body life by walking according to the spirit and drinking of the Spirit.
[58]  However, if we consider our experience, we have to admit that most of our walk is not according to the spirit but according to the flesh.
[59]  As long as our intention is natural, even if it is a seemingly good intention to help the church or the saints or to do something for the Lord s recovery, we plan to have a success.
[60]  Perhaps we do not do outwardly sinful things, but if we scheme to be successful, even if we say that it is for the Lord, it is actually for our self and is natural.
[61]  If we visit a locality because we have a burden to go, but we do not have the Lord s leading, we may have outward success.
[62]  Ephesians 4:15-16 says, Holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.
[63]  Thus, as we walk according to the spirit and drink of the Spirit, we grow up into Christ the Head.
[64]  IN THE CHURCH AND THE WORK THE ELDERS AND SERVING ONES
[65]  The church in our locality or the area in which we work should not collapse or stop if we are gone.
[66]  We need to realize that to be a center of the church or the work is to be a cancer to the Body of Christ, which will eventually bring death to the Body.
[67]  We may say that we do not have an intention or desire to be a center, but our way of caring for the church or doing the work often builds us up as a center.
[68]  If we are able to minister life to others and help them with their problems, we become very attractive to others; it seems that we become the life pulse of the church in our locality.
[69]  Question: You have encouraged us to walk according to the spirit and not to rely on the exercise of the spirit in the meetings.
[70]  If we leading brothers are led by the Lord to change the meeting environment, how should we help the saints who want to continue in the old way?
[71]  When we first began to the call on the name of the Lord and pray-read in the meetings in the 1960s, I often felt that the calling and the pray-reading were somewhat wild, but I did not say much to correct the situation.
[72]  Recently, I did not feel good about the shouting of some young brothers in the meetings because I did not believe that their shouting was of the spirit, but I did not say anything.
[73]  As leading ones, we also need to consider the matter of our character.
