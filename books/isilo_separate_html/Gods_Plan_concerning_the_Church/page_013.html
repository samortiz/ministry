<p><em>Question: Your intention is good, but is your practice too extreme and unable to accomplish its purposes? If you would change your way slightly and form an alliance with other Christian groups, would your work not have a better result?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Like you, we also fear going to extremes. Hence, we do not make decisions according to our own will, nor do we rely on others&rsquo; opinions; we take only God&rsquo;s Word as the standard. The Word of God is never extreme. We should be faithful to God&rsquo;s enlightenment and not be disobedient to His vision. If we act contrary to what God has shown us, we will have no peace in our conscience. Therefore, we find it very hard to change our way in order to form alliances with other groups.</p>
<p>Although we pay attention to the result of the work, we feel that the Lord wants us to focus on the testimony of His church. We should not emphasize the result of the work and neglect the testimony of the church, nor should we sacrifice the testimony of the church for the result of the work. Many who are zealous and love the Lord pay more attention to the work than to the testimony of the church. Their work saves sinners and edifies the saints, but it also tears down the building of the local churches and damages the testimony of the church. We feel that this is not the Lord&rsquo;s intention or the way that He desires. The Lord&rsquo;s intention is to build up the local churches. His way is for the work to contribute to the testimony of the local churches. We are not saying that we do not care about the propagation of the Lord&rsquo;s work but that we would rather propagate our work according to the Lord&rsquo;s intention and way.</p>
<p>Some people propagate the work on the one hand, but they greatly kill the Lord&rsquo;s work on the other hand. If they were willing to do their work according to the Lord&rsquo;s intention and way, the propagation of their work would be unlimited. For many years we have been learning to care for the Lord&rsquo;s work without deviating from His way and testimony. If the children of God would care for His testimony in their work for the Lord, the result would be unlimited and immeasurable. Man&rsquo;s priority is reversed, his order is confused, and his wisdom and perspective are foolish. When people pay attention only to opportunities for their work and the result of their work, they do not realize that they damage the opportunities for the work and kill the result of the work. When we drop the opportunities and the result of our work for the sake of the Lord&rsquo;s testimony, the Lord will give us an opened door that no one can shut. Then the result will be unlimited and immeasurable. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy we would rather have the foolishness of God than the wisdom of man (1 Cor. 1:25). If we abandon the testimony that God entrusted to us and join ourselves with others for the sake of opportunities and the result of the work, I do not believe that we would be blessed by the Lord. The results that we have today are all due to stressing the ground of the church and not yielding or compromising regarding this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MEANING<br />
OF THE GROUND OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p><em>Question: Are you saying that only you are the church and that no one else is the church?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We have never said that only we are the church. Such words are naive and immature. However, we testify that only we are standing on the ground of the church.</p>
<p><em>Question: What is the ground of the church?</em></p>
<p>Answer: The church is universally one, but her local expressions are many. Nevertheless, there should be only one expression in each locality. The ground of this local expression is what we mean by the ground of the church. In the Old Testament Jerusalem was the ground upon which the children of Israel could be God&rsquo;s people. It was where they needed to be. Likewise, the church should be expressed locally on the earth. Just as Jerusalem was the proper ground for the children of Israel, a locality is the proper ground for the church. When the children of Israel were taken captive to Babylon, they left Jerusalem and lost the ground. In the same way, when the church was divided into sects and left the ground of locality, it lost the ground for the expression of the church on the earth.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the church in Jerusalem was expressed on the ground of Jerusalem (Acts 8:1). The church was also expressed in Corinth (1 Cor. 1:2), which was the ground for the expression of the church in that locality. If the church in Corinth had later divided into the four different groups, such as the Pauline church, the Petrine church, the Apollonian church, and the church of Christ, then these four groups would have left the local nature of the church and lost the ground of locality, which is the ground of the church. Suppose the people in the Pauline church in Corinth had gone to Samaria and had set up a Pauline church there. If some believers from Jerusalem had later gone to Samaria and found a Pauline &ldquo;church&rdquo; without a local nature, they would begin to meet on the ground of locality. Thus, even though there are two &ldquo;churches&rdquo; in that locality, which one has the proper ground and is on the ground of the church? Surely, the Pauline church does not have the proper ground, whereas the group meeting on the local ground has the proper ground. The ground of the Pauline church is not local but sectarian; hence, it is wrong. Only those who meet on the local ground can express the church, because their ground is local and proper.</p>
<p>According to the example above, the church in Jerusalem was on the ground of the church. The church in Corinth was also on the ground of the church, but when it later divided into four groups, it was on sectarian grounds. The ground of the church is the ground of locality. Various sects have lost the ground of the church because they do not take the ground of locality. They do not stand on the ground of the church.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> </body></html>
