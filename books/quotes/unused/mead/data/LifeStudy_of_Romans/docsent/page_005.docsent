   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The New Testament, the Fulfillment</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the Old Testament</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What about the New Testament?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The New Testament is the fulfillment of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whatever the Old Testament predicted regarding Christ and the church has been completely fulfilled in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Individual Christ in the Gospels</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The four gospels are a living biography of a wonderful Person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The four gospels reveal a wonderful Person, the individual Christ, Who came to fulfill the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Perhaps you have read the gospels frequently without recognizing the many aspects of Christ revealed in them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the gospels of Matthew and John more than 60 aspects of Christ are presented.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As we have pointed out on previous occasions, in chapter 1 of Matthew we see that Christ is Jesus, Jehovah the Savior, and also Emmanuel, God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In chapter 4 He is revealed as the great light.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the following chapters we see Him as the greater David, the greater temple, the greater Solomon, the greater Jonah, the living Moses with the up-to-date regulations, and the living Elijah who fulfills the prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we read the book of Matthew carefully, we will find at least 30 more items concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These items are listed in the first life-study of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ is the real David, the real Moses, the real Solomon, and the real temple.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the Gospel of John we find 20 or 30 items more.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ is the light, the air, the water, the food, the Shepherd, the door, and the pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Have you seen this Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although He is our Savior, He is much more than that.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is a most wonderful Person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You simply cannot say who Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you say He is God, I will say He is man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you say He is man, I will say He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you say He is the Son of God, I will say He is God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you say He is God the Father, I will say He is God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you say He is the Creator, I will say He is the Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ is everything!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Corporate Christ in Acts</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The book of Acts follows the gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What is the Acts?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Acts is the spreading, the increase, and the enlargement of this wonderful Person.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This wonderful Person was limited and confined in the little man Jesus, but in Acts He has been reproduced, increased, and enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He has increased by spreading into Peter, John, James, Stephen, and even Saul of Tarsus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He has spread into tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of His believers, making all of them a part of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Collectively speaking, all of these believers along with Himself become the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, in the four gospels we have the individual Christ; in Acts we have the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By the end of Acts we see the individual Christ as well as the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, we do not know how the individual Christ can become the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How can we, the vast multitude of believers, become a part of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Full Definition of</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>the Corporate Christ in Romans</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This brings us to the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Romans explains how the individual Christ can become the corporate Christ and how all of us who were once sinners and enemies of God can become parts of Christ and form His one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The book of Romans offers us a full definition of this, unfolding both the Christian life and the church life in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Thus, we come to the book of Romans for training on the Christian life and the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Romans provides a sketch of them both.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Now we know the position of the book of Romans in the Bible.</S>
