In this message we come to the types of God's anticipated redemption and salvation. In the types the dispensing of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God is revealed very clearly.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PASSOVER BEING A COMPLETE PICTURE<br>OF GOD'S FULL SALVATION</H2><P>God's salvation is based on His redemption. Without redemption, God's salvation has no foundation. However, God's salvation is not that simple; it includes many more items than redemption. How we thank the Lord that in the Passover we have a complete picture of God's full salvation. Adam and Eve, the first generation of mankind, enjoyed God's salvation to a small degree before the Passover. They were the first generation to enjoy God's salvation. Then Abel enjoyed more of God's salvation than his father and mother did. Many generations passed, including Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, but no one experienced God's complete salvation until the Passover. It was not until the time of the exodus that God ordained the Passover.</P>
