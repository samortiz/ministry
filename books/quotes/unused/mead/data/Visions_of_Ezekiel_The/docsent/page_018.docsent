   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOING STRAIGHTFORWARD AND NOT TURNING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Then Ezekiel says that every one of the living creatures went straightforward.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They did not turn, but some returned.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>While one of the living creatures is walking toward the north, the living creature facing the south must return, walking backward.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, one goes straightforward while the opposite creature returns.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the same time, the other two must walk sideways.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One walks sideways to the left, and the other walks sideways to the right.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No matter which direction the four living creatures are moving, there is no need to turn.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One simply goes straightforward, one returns, walking backward, and the other two walk sideways.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is a beautiful picture of the coordination that we need in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many young people cannot suffer to be coordinated together.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Rather, they prefer to be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As long as they are separated, there is no suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But, once they become coordinated, there is a kind of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In coordination there is no freedom, no convenience, but it saves a lot of turns.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If one is walking by himself, he may walk to the north, turn, and walk to the east; he may turn again and walk to the south; he may turn again and walk to the west.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He may go in all four of these directions by having many turns.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But in the Lord's ministry there is no turning.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everyone must go straightforward.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If someone does everything without coordination in the church service, he must make a lot of turns.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If he does the cleaning, if he plays the piano, if he does the singing, if he does the speaking, if he does all the functioning, then he must make a lot of turns.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the church service, there is no need of any turns.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Everyone has his function; everyone has his position.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He can simply go straightforward in his position, in his function.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If there is the need of some other direction, others can take care of that.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is no need for him to turn.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We all must learn not only how to walk straightforward, but also how to return that is, to walk backward and also how to walk sideways.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Though this may seem quite awkward, we all must learn this lesson; otherwise, we can never be coordinated.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some brothers and sisters are too flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They make a lot of turns.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When there is the need to walk south, they walk south.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When there is the need to walk east, they turn and walk east.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>No matter what direction is needed, they always turn to walk in that direction.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They do not need others to coordinate with them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The problem is that people either want to do everything or nothing at all.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If they are asked to walk, they want to walk in all four directions.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They want to make a lot of turns.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the proper coordinated way, there is no left turn; neither is there a right turn.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There are no turns.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Either you walk straightforward or you return, that is, you walk backward.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Or you walk sideways.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The most difficult thing is to walk sideways like a crab.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many brothers and sisters are unable to have a crab walk.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must have the proper coordination in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In some of the churches, certain brothers and sisters are very capable and they make a lot of turns.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Other brothers and sisters are not so capable, so they do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This means there is no coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We all must learn to walk straightforward and to walk backward and to walk sideways.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must practice to have this kind of coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>COORDINATION IN MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If in a local church one brother has a ministry to build up the saints and another brother has a ministry of preaching the gospel, they must coordinate.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Otherwise, they may cause a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If there were only one ministry, there would be little problem.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>With one ministry, there would be no fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But when there are two ministries within a local church, unless these two brothers know how to coordinate, they will surely compete and fight against each other.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The brother who is burdened for the gospel will be fighting for the gospel, for the outreach, for the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He will go to many brothers and sisters to convince them to join him for the outreach.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The other brother will say, "All the gospel-preaching brother knows is outreach.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Gospel, gospel, gospel!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He brings in many new ones, creating a lot of diaper work.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He brings them in, but he doesn't care for them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He is too much for the outreach.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Look at today's poor church situation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All the meetings are full of childish, babyish ones."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He would tell the saints not to go out for the gospel, but to come and help him do the diaper work.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Do you realize that the result of these two ministries would be a kind of division?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There would be a division into a gospel sect and a shepherding sect.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What then shall they do?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>At this point, they have to learn to coordinate.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Whenever the brother with the fishing ministry is functioning, the other brother must learn to walk backward.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Then, when the brother with the mending ministry is functioning, the brother with the gospel ministry must learn to walk backward.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>All the other saints must follow these two, walking sideways.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Sometimes they walk sideways to the left, following the fishing ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>At other times they walk sideways to the right, following the mending ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This enables the body to move, but it is not easy to learn.</S>
