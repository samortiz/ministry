<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Growing Great, Causing Some<br>of the Host and Some of the Stars to Fall<br>to the Earth, and Trampling Them</H2><P>The little horn grew great, as high as the host of heaven, and he caused some of the host and some of the stars to fall to the earth, and he trampled them (v. 10; 11:30b-35). This signifies that he became great in power and persecuted the saints (signified by the host of heaven and the stars&#151;12:3). In all these evil things he typifies the coming Antichrist (Rev. 13:5-7; 2 Thes. 2:3b-4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Growing in Greatness<br>to That of the Prince of the Host</H2><P>The little horn grew in greatness to that of the Prince of the host (God); and from Him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of His sanctuary was thrown down (Dan. 8:11; 11:31). In all these evils also he typifies Antichrist (9:27).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. A Host Given to Him<br>for War against the Daily Sacrifice</H2><P>A host (an army of Israel) was given to him for war against the daily sacrifice because of transgression. He cast truth down to the ground, and he took action and prospered (8:12). He stopped the daily sacrifices in the temple and defiled it with pigs and with fornication. Furthermore, because of the transgression of the Jewish people, he cast truth to the ground. This means that there was no righteousness or justice.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. Arising, Being of Fierce Countenance<br>and Skilled in Ambiguities</H2><P>Verse 23 speaks of him as the king that would arise, being of fierce countenance and skilled in ambiguities. He would speak in such a manner that his word could be interpreted in many different ways.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>f. His Power Being Mighty</H2><P>His power would be mighty but not by his own power. He would destroy in an extraordinary manner, destroying mighty men and the holy people (v. 24).</P>
