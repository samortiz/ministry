   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although Job's friends had come to him for the purpose of comforting him, he regarded them as "troubling comforters," and he called their words "words of wind."</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In verses 4 and 5 Job continued, "I also could speak like you,/If your soul were in my soul's stead;/I could join my words together against you / And shake my head at you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>/I could strengthen you with my mouth,/And the movement of my lips would mitigate your pain."</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Job went so far as to say that God had torn him to pieces, had delivered him over to the unjust and cast him down into the hands of the wicked, had broken him apart, had taken him by the neck and dashed him to pieces, and had set him up as His target.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, Job's face was reddened with weeping, and on his eyelids was the shadow of death.</S>
