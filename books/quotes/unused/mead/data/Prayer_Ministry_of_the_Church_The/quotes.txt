[1]  CONTENTS The Prayer Ministry of the Church Pray in This Way In the Name of the Lord Jesus God's Commitment The Prayer of Authority Watch and Pray
[2]  Through these messages we hope that God's children will learn to pray with His eternal purpose as the center and learn to carry out the responsibility and authority God has given the church to withstand Satan's attack against prayer.
[3]  "Moreover if your brother sins against you, go, reprove him between you and him alone.
[4]  Truly I say to you, Whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven.
[5]  Some may ask why God would want the earth to control heaven.
[6]  If we want to understand this, we have to remember that our God is limited by time.
[7]  Yet God does not act independently; He will not do anything by Himself.
[8]  Even though God has a will, He wants the free will on earth to echo His will before He does anything.
[9]  God wants to do many things on earth today.
[10]  But He must have the church stand on His side before He can accomplish these things through the church.
[11]  God cannot do what He wants to do by Himself; He has to do it with the cooperation of the church.
[12]  We have seen that the church should bind what God wants to bind and loose what God wants to loose.
[13]  The Lord tells us in verse 19, "Again, truly I say to you that if two of you are in harmony on earth concerning any matter, any matter that they ask will be done for them from My Father who is in the heavens" alternate translation .
[14]  We must remember that prayer is not the first thing.
[15]  If the church is to have this kind of ministerial prayer on earth, every brother and sister must learn before the Lord to deny the fleshly life.
[16]  He does not say that the Father will answer if we pray in His name.
[17]  The Lord also shows us in these verses that individual prayers do not work.
[18]  If you do not see this point, you will not understand why the Lord says what He says.
[19]  Brothers and sisters, when we truly stand on the ground of the church and take up the responsibility of such a ministry of prayer before God, we will see God's will carried out in the church where we are.
[20]  In verse 20 the Lord says, "For where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst."
[21]  "And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites, because they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners, so that they may be seen by men.
[22]  But you, when you pray, enter into your private room, and shut your door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will repay you.
[23]  You then pray in this way: Our Father who is in the heavens, Your name be sanctified; Your kingdom come; Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth.
[24]  The Lord taught us not only to shut ourselves up in secret when we pray; He also taught us not to "babble empty words as the Gentiles do; for they suppose that in their multiplicity of words they will be heard."
[25]  When a man takes the name of God in vain, God does not show His wrath by striking him with thunder.
[26]  The Third Desire: "Your Will Be Done, as in Heaven, So Also on Earth"
[27]  Prayer means that God wants to do something, yet He will not do it Himself; He will wait for man on earth to pray about it before He does it.
[28]  The reason that we need to pray is because God will not do anything by Himself; He has to wait for man to pray before He works.
[29]  When some read this, they do not understand why the Lord turns suddenly from God's name, His kingdom, and His will to our daily bread.
[30]  The Third Thing: "Do Not Bring Us into Temptation, but Deliver Us from the Evil One"
[31]  On the one hand, when we live for God on earth and have a strong desire to be for His name, His kingdom, and His will, we have material needs; we need to ask for our daily bread.
[32]  Brothers and sisters, we have to pray for God to protect us so that our daily bread is provided, our conscience is clean, and we do not face temptation.
[33]  Lastly, the Lord taught us to give praise for three things: "For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever.
[34]  We pray that the Lord would deliver us from the evil one because the kingdom is the Father's and not Satan's, because the power is the Father's and not Satan's, and because the glory is the Father's and not Satan's. This is the main point: since the kingdom belongs to the Father, we should not fall into the hand of Satan; since the power belongs to the Father, we should not fall into the hand of Satan; and since the glory belongs to the Father, we should not fall into the hand of Satan.
[35]  After the Lord finished His teaching on prayer, He went on to say, "For if you forgive men their offenses, your heavenly Father will forgive you also; but if you do not forgive men their offenses, neither will your Father forgive your offenses."
[36]  This is the Lord's interpretation of verse 12, which says, "Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors."
[37]  CHAPTER THREE IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS GOD'S COMMITMENT Scripture Reading: Phil 2:9-11; Eph 1:21; John 14:13-14; 15:16; 16:23-24, 26a; Mark 16:17; Luke 10:17-19; 24:47; Acts 3:6; 4:7, 10, 12; 10:43; 16:18; 19:5; 1 Cor 6:11
[38]  No one on earth can be saved without the name of the Lord Jesus, and no one can be useful in the hand of God without knowing the name of the Lord Jesus.
[39]  Philippians 2:10-11 says, "That in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue should openly confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father."
[40]  In the New Testament, not only do we see the name of Jesus; we also see one very peculiar expression: "in the name of Jesus."
[41]  It is not just a matter of the name of Jesus Christ but a matter of being in the name of Jesus Christ.
[42]  If we read God's Word carefully and if we pursue the spiritual pathway, we may often say that we do things in the name of the Lord Jesus or that we do things in the name of Jesus Christ, but actually we do not know what it is to be in this name.
[43]  If we do not know how to do things in the name of the Lord Jesus, we cannot even be a Christian.
[44]  The name of Jesus Christ is the name He received before God, and being in the name of Jesus Christ is for God's children to partake of this name.
[45]  Sometimes we tell someone, "Go and tell a certain brother what to do.
[46]  If he asks you who said it, just tell him that I said it."
[47]  If you commit your name to someone and he uses your name, you have to bear the responsibility of his use of your name.
[48]  The last night the Lord Jesus was on earth, He told the disciples, "Whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
[49]  We see in the Bible one example of acting in the name of the Lord.
[50]  When the archangel Michael argued with the devil over the body of Moses, did he say, "I rebuke you" or "May the Lord rebuke you"?
[51]  Doing things in the name of the Lord Jesus means that we use His name as we use our own name.
[52]  If we are not standing on the ground of baptism, we cannot use His name, because the cross will not have a free way in us, and the Lord Jesus will not have any effect on us; we cannot use the name.
[53]  Luke 24:47 says, "And that repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem."
[54]  First Corinthians 6:11 says, "And these things were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God."
[55]  At that time, Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit, and he said to them, "Let it be known to you all and to all the people of Israel that in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you crucified and whom God has raised from the dead, in this name this man stands before you in good health."
[56]  Moreover, the Lord's name has been given to us not only to deal with men, to save men, to heal men, to have authority over the demons, and to cast them out of men.
[57]  The day will come when God opens our eyes to see the power in this name, the greatness in this name, and what a wonder it is that God has committed this name to us.
[58]  Brothers and sisters, since this name is placed in our hands for the purpose of dealing with men, the devil, and God, we should realize that we must live a certain kind of life before we can have the power to use this name.
[59]  CHAPTER FOUR THE PRAYER OF AUTHORITY Scripture Reading: Matt 18:18-19; Mark 11:23-24; Eph 1:20-22; 2:6; 6:12-13, 18-19
[60]  There is a difference between the meaning of ascension and the meaning of death and resurrection.
[61]  Thank the Lord that Ephesians 2:6 tells us that God has "raised us up together with Him and seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus."
[62]  A prayer with authority has the position of being in the heavenlies as its basis.
[63]  Prayer with authority has much to do with the overcomers.
[64]  If a Christian does not know this, he cannot be an overcomer.
[65]  We have to remember that God and the Lord Jesus are on the throne, while the enemy is under the throne.
[66]  If Christ had not ascended, there would be no way for us to turn.
[67]  We have to pay special attention to the binding prayer and loosing prayer.
[68]  We have to bind many things, and we have to loose many things.
[69]  May God be gracious to us so that all of us can learn to pray with authority.
[70]  Not only do we have to learn to pray, we also have to learn to know the victory of Christ.
[71]  Despite the facts that problems are piling up and that we acknowledge with our mouth that prayer is the only way to solve them, we talk more than we pray, and we worry and resort to methods more than we pray.
[72]  Let me quote again the words of the brother who knew the Lord in a deep way.
[73]  After you have decided or made plans to have a richer prayer life, Satan will begin a new strategy; he will make you more busy and will pile up work and need upon you so that you will have no time or opportunity to pray.
[74]  If we find that our prayer life has been completely annulled or has fallen into such a confined place that we become completely helpless in living a spiritual and transcendent, overcoming life, under these circumstances, we should pray to the Lord, "Lord, while I pray, I will commit my responsibilities to You.
[75]  After we have offered to God the portion and position that He deserves and have tithed to God, we will discover that we can more effectively use the other nine-tenths of our time, more so than when we were trying to use all our time for ourselves before tithing it to the Lord.
[76]  Not only must we be watchful in guarding the time of prayer, but we also must be watchful while we pray, in order that we may pray and have things to pray about.
[77]  Satan will harass us not only through all kinds of things and outward circumstances that force us to have no time to pray, but even after we actually kneel down to pray he will also use all kinds of deception to frustrate us from prayer.
[78]  Our minds may be very clear and our thoughts uncluttered before we pray, but as soon as we kneel down to pray, our thoughts become confused.
[79]  We begin to remember things that we do not need to remember, and we begin to think of things that we do not need to think about ahead of time.
[80]  The tiredness does not come when we do not pray, but as soon as we pray we feel tired and want to sleep.
[81]  It says that if one wants to pray to God he should first be well prepared about what he wants from God.
[82]  Brothers and sisters, when we kneel down to pray, if we do not know what we want, how can we expect God to answer our prayer?
[83]  We must also be watchful in our prayer so that we do not fall under Satan's deception of not making our prayer specific.
[84]  There are often many things that need to be decided, many people that need to be prayed for, many central messages that need to be released, and many problems that need to be solved.
