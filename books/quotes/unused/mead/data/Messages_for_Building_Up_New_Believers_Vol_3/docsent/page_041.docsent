   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Sickness Not Being Something Dreadful</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Never consider sickness to be something dreadful.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The knife is not in just anyone s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If the one who shaves my hair is my brother, I would not be scared even if he used a big knife.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But it would be very frightening indeed if I allowed my enemy to cut my hair.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to ask in whose hand is the knife.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I would be scared if the surgeon who operated on me happened to be my enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But I would not be scared if the scalpel was in my brother s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Please bear in mind that all sicknesses are in God s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many sick brothers and sisters who are so anxious about their health seem to believe that their sicknesses are in the enemy s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Please remember that every sickness has been measured by God s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Satan is the creator of sickness, and I believe that Satan can make people sick.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But everyone who has read the book of Job knows that sickness happens only with God s permission.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every sickness is under God s limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Job shows us clearly that Satan cannot make a person sick without God s permission and limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God s permission and limitation are the abiding factors.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Consider Job s case: God allowed him to be sick, but He did not allow his life to be harmed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whenever we are sick, we should not feel hopeless and we should not worry.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not insist on being healed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do not complain that the sickness has continued too long and that you are afraid of death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Please bear in mind that sickness is in the hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is measured by Him and under His limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After Job s trials ran their course, the illness went away; the illness accomplished God s purpose in him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Job s story we see an end to God s discipline James 5:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I would like to say that many people s sicknesses do not have a proper ending; they have not learned the lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must realize that all illnesses are in God s hand; they are all measured by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Often all we have to do is confess our sins, and the matter is over.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>D. Learning Our Lesson</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>in the Midst of Our Illness</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God allows many illnesses to remain in us in order for us to learn a lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The sooner we learn the lesson, the sooner the illness leaves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many people love themselves too much.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Let me say a frank word to them: The only reason many of them are sick is that they love themselves too much.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many people love themselves to the extent that sickness becomes inevitable.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are of little use to God if He does not purge us of our self-love.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to learn to not love ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some people think only of themselves all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They think the whole world revolves around them and that they are the center of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They think that everyone should live for them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Their thoughts are occupied with nothing but themselves day and night; in their view everything revolves around them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God in heaven is for them, and God on earth is for them as well.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ is for them, and the church is for them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In fact, the whole world is for them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God has no alternative but to tear down this center.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many people are not easily healed because they expect sympathy from others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I know that some sisters have experienced this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When they reject the sympathy of others, their sicknesses leave.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Perhaps many are ill because they like to be ill.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They are loved only when they are ill, so they like to be ill.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>No one loves them when they are not ill, so they always try to be sick in order to be loved.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In fact, they want to be sick forever so that they can be loved forever.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I have seen such cases.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Sometimes it takes someone to rebuke them strongly, saying, You are sick because you love yourself too much.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You want others to love you and to pay attention to you in your illness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You want others to visit you and to sympathize with you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is why you are always sick.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As soon as they accept God s dealing and acknowledge the cause of their illness, they are healed immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I can report hundreds of cases that I have witnessed during the past twenty or more years of my life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They all prove that many people are sick for specific reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Their illnesses are healed immediately when they identify the causes, deal with them, and remove them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As long as the causes remain, they cannot be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I know of a brother who always desired affection from others.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He wanted to be loved, to be spoken to nicely, to receive visits, and to be treated in a gentle way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If anyone asked how he was doing, he immediately would relate everything that had happened the previous night or that morning in a detailed way.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He could tell others almost the exact time of his fever, from what hour to what hour, and the kind of headache he experienced, from what hour to what hour.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He could tell you exactly how many times he breathed and how many times his heart beat a minute.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He was always feeling ill, and he always liked to tell others about his illness.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He wanted the warm sympathy of others.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If you talked to him, he would have nothing to talk about except his illness.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Every day he talked about his illness, and he wondered why he was never healed.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is not an easy thing to speak an honest word to others.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>One must pay a price to speak the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>One day I gathered enough strength within myself to speak to this one.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I said, The only reason you have been sick so long is that you like to be sick.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He denied it.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I said, Do you not love your illness?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>You are afraid that this illness will leave you.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>You love your illness.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He denied it again.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But I said, You like others to sympathize with you and to love you.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>You like others to take care of you and to treat you nicely.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You cannot have it by other means, so you try to get it by becoming ill.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If you want to be healed by the Lord, you must rid yourself of this thought!</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When others ask how you are doing, you need to learn to say, I am fine.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>See what will happen if you do that!</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When others ask how you were doing the night before, you should say, Fine!</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He said, My heart is sincere.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I cannot lie.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I feel that I am not fine.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>What should I do if I truly was not well the night before?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>I said, Let me read you a verse.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The son of the Shunammite woman was lying on the bed already dead.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>She went to see Elisha, and he asked, Is it well with you?...Is it well with the child?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>And she said, It is well 2 Kings 4:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Actually, her son was lying on the bed already dead.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Why did she say that it was well?</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>She said it because she believed.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>She believed that God would save her son.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Today you can believe, too.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>When others ask, How were you last night?</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>You should say, Fine.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>It is fine even if you died the night before.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>You have to believe that it was fine.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>He had nothing to say after these words.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>As soon as he denied his self-love, rejected sympathy, and dropped his expectation for consolation, his illness went away.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We must realize that many illnesses have internal causes as well as external causes.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>A man must learn to believe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>When God s purpose is achieved, the sickness goes away.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Once God achieves His spiritual goal in us, our sickness is over.</S>
