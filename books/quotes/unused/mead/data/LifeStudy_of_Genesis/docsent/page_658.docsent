   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Disciplining Simeon</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Joseph was also wise in his discipline of Simeon.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 42:19 and 20 Joseph said to his brothers, "If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison: go ye, carry grain for the famine of your houses: but bring your youngest brother unto me."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At first Joseph thought that one brother should be sent to bring the youngest brother and that all the rest should remain in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But after three days Joseph changed his mind and decided that only one should stay in prison and that the others should go to bring the youngest brother to him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, he "took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes" 42:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I believe that it was Simeon who took the lead in plotting to murder Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I also believe that Simeon took the lead to bind Joseph and to cast him into the pit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As 49:5-7 reveals, Simeon was a person given to anger.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, Joseph had him bound and put into prison.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What do you suppose Simeon thought about there in prison?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I believe that he repented to the uttermost and regretted what he had done.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Perhaps he said, "Why did this man choose me?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Why did he set his eyes upon me?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Maybe it was because I took the lead in the plot against Joseph."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Simeon was in prison for at least half a year, having been accused of being a spy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This was a serious crime and it could have cost him his life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do not think that Joseph was cruel and merciless for treating Simeon in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the contrary, he was full of mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The ten brothers deserved their three days in prison, and Simeon deserved a longer period of imprisonment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Joseph was wise in doing this.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was controlled by a life that gave him a sober discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whatever Joseph did to his brothers was right.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He did neither too little to them nor did he do too much.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We in the church life need to have such a life of discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we have this discernment, we shall know what to do with the brothers and the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We shall know how far we can go with them and where we need to restrain ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>C. Testing Them</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>with Respect to Benjamin</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, Joseph displayed his wisdom in testing his brothers with respect to Benjamin 42:15, 20, 36-37 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 42:15 Joseph commanded that the youngest brother, Benjamin, be brought to him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By singling out Benjamin in this way, Joseph helped his brothers to think about Joseph himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If I had been Joseph, I would have said, "Don't forget what you did to Joseph."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Joseph, however, wisely referred to Benjamin.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As soon as he referred to Benjamin, his brothers were reminded of Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This must have touched their consciences.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In 42:13 they said to him, "Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If I had been Joseph I would have asked, "Where is that one whom you say is not?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What happened to him?"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In his wisdom, Joseph touched his brothers' consciences.</S>
