<p>We have to see what it is to be a member of the Body of Christ. We should ask, what is the ability of a member? What is the function of a member? If Christ has not entered into you, you are merely an individual and not a member of the Body of Christ. When Christ comes into you, you become a member of the Body of Christ, but you still may not have a function because Christ has not yet been developed in you. If Christ has the ground in you to develop and mature, your spiritual gift will be manifested spontaneously. Therefore, we have to see that we are responsible if we do not have any serving function. If we do not have any function, it is because although we may already have the life of Christ and the Spirit of Christ in us, we have not given Him the opportunity and ground to grow and develop in us.<p>Many Christians have the concept that they are not of much use in the church. They think that although they are saved ones, they are not able to do anything. For example, there was once a person in Shanghai who did not pursue spiritual matters very much after he was saved. Although he regularly attended the meetings and sometimes prayed with tears, his mind and his thinking could not be turned around. He did not sin, but neither did he love the Lord. When people exhorted him to love and serve the Lord, he would tell them that since he was merely occupying a seat in the meetings and could not minister the word, preach the gospel, or care for the saints, it did not make any difference whether or not he was in the church. However, not long after he said this, the Lord did a work in him, and he became ill. The Lord worked in him, causing him to sense the Lord’s loveliness. Then this brother began to pursue the Lord, to spend much time in prayer every day, to consecrate himself to the Lord, to allow the Lord to reign in him in both big and small matters, and to practice to be in the Lord’s presence and to walk with the Lord. Thus, he allowed the Lord to have the first place in him. After he had such a turn, his function in the church was manifested. Not only did he know how to read the Bible properly, but when he stood up to read the Bible in the meetings, his reading was full of feeling. At this time his gift was manifested. When he spoke concerning a few verses from the Bible, people could sense the shining and the authority of God. This was not the eloquence of man but the gift of God.<p>When a baby is first born and is lying on the bed, his feet are lovely, but they cannot walk because they are not yet developed. Day after day, however, through eating and drinking, the baby’s feet grow and become strong, and eventually the day comes when he is able to stand. Some time later he is able to walk and run. Surely this is a kind of miracle. A baby who originally could not walk is now able to walk and run. Spiritual gifts mature and develop in the same way. Without life, there is no spiritual ability, and without life, there is no spiritual function. Many people have been saved for years, yet their functions are not yet manifested. They do not know how to preach the gospel, visit the believers, or lead others. The only reason for this is that the life in them has not grown or matured and that Christ has no ground in them. Hence, their spiritual ability, their spiritual gift, is not manifested.<p>When we see how the Lord has cared for us and preserved us, borne our sins, and given us His life and everything, a love for Him will be generated in us. It is in this love that we consecrate ourselves to Him and allow Him to enlighten us and show us the things in us and our relationships with others that are not pleasing to Him and need to be dealt with. At this time if we submit to Him and deal with these matters, we will have joy, strength, and peace within. Moreover, we will be able to care for, preach the gospel to, and shepherd people. Once Christ’s life is developed and matured in us, our function will immediately be manifested.
