[2]  Volumes 37 and 38 of the Collected Works contain miscellaneous messages given by Brother Watchman Nee between 1934 and 1942.
[3]  Some are words of exhortation and comfort; others are short expositions.
[4]  In 2 Corinthians 5:16, Paul said, "So then we, from now on, know no one according to the flesh; even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him so no longer."
[5]  OF THE TWO DISCIPLES ON THE WAY TO EMMAUS
[6]  On the way they were talking to each other concerning all the things which had occurred, that is, about the things concerning the Lord Jesus which Mary had related.
[7]  CHAPTER TWO BLESSINGS THAT CAN BE ENJOYED TODAY Scripture Reading: Isa 49:10; Rev 7:9-17
[8]  These two passages mention a few kinds of blessings: 1 not hungering or thirsting, 2 not having the scorching heat nor sun strike them, 3 being guided to springs of water, and 4 God wiping away every tear.
[9]  The first three blessings are mentioned in both passages, while the fourth is mentioned only in Revelation.
[10]  To hunger and thirst is to have a hope that is not yet satisfied.
[11]  "Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst" John 6:35 .
[12]  CHAPTER THREE GOD'S KEEPING POWER Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 5:23; Num 13:25-33; 14:4-10; Josh 14:6-12
[13]  It is a distressing fact that some Christians believe in God's saving power, but they do not believe in His keeping power.
[14]  They have received God's saving grace but have not yet received His keeping grace.
[15]  They do not realize that He who is the Giver of grace is also the One who maintains us in His grace.
[16]  Let us see from the Scriptures how we who have been saved by God can be kept by Him.
[17]  There is another noteworthy matter in connection with Caleb.
[18]  In Numbers 14:9 he exhorted the whole congregation of the children of Israel, saying: "Do not rebel against Jehovah; and do not fear the people of the land, for they will be our bread."
[19]  He told the Israelites that they could go up immediately, they could overcome, and they did not have to be afraid of them, because "they will be our bread."
[20]  CHAPTER FOUR PUTTING ON THE HELMET OF SALVATION Scripture Reading: Gen 2:9, 17; 3:6-7; 2 Cor 1:12; Eph 6:17; 4:23; Rom 12:2; 8:5-6 ONE
[21]  In the garden of Eden, there were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[22]  God commanded Adam saying, "Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die" Gen 2:16-17 .
[23]  But after his fall, his mind and intellect became different from what God had intended them to be at the beginning; they were no longer what God wanted them to be.
[24]  Romans 12:2 says, "But be transformed by the renewing of the mind that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and well pleasing and perfect."
[25]  We must all remember that our responsibility is to obey God's will, while God is responsible for the result of our obedience to His will.
[26]  As far as smoothness is concerned, we can say that the Son of God lived the roughest life on earth.
[27]  When we say that cleverness is useless to a Christian, we do not mean that we should go and do foolish things.
[28]  Romans 8:5-6 says, "For those who are according to the flesh mind the things of the flesh; but those who are according to the spirit, the things of the Spirit.
[29]  For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace."
[30]  IN THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Col 1:18; 1 Cor 12:14-26
[31]  There are many members in the Body of Christ, and the members are one, each having their different function.
[32]  If we see that the life of the Body is a matter of fellowship and mutual supply, we will realize that before the Lord we should not be one who consumes life but one who supplies life.
[33]  CHAPTER SIX THE FUNCTION OF THE ANOINTING Scripture Reading: Lev 8:12, 30; Luke 4:18-19; Acts 10:38; 1 John 2:27; Psa 133:1-3 THE ANOINTING BEFORE GOD CONSECRATION
[34]  Leviticus 8 speaks of Aaron being anointed and chapter nine refers to his offering of sacrifices.
[35]  Before becoming king, David was also anointed by Samuel, and then he began to serve God according to the ministry which God had bestowed upon him 1 Sam 16:12-13 .
[36]  He said, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to announce the gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to proclaim release to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to send away in release those who are oppressed, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, the year of jubilee" Luke 4:18-19 .
[37]  We will not need to speak strenuously or painstakingly, for we are conscious of the presence of the anointing upon us.
[38]  Our words may be rather common and simple, yet we become stronger as we speak and feel the presence of the anointing.
[39]  At other times we may also speak, but we feel like a deflated tire; we do not feel that there is any sense in our talking, and others do not sense the presence of power.
[40]  First John 2:27 says, "And as for you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him."
[41]  If we do something that the Lord wants us to do, we will have the anointing once we move, and we will know that it is right.
[42]  If it is something that we should not do, we will feel like a deflated tire once we do it, and we will know that we are not doing the right thing.
[43]  Many times when we consider whether or not we should do something, we find good reasons for it; but when we are about to start, we feel that we are doing it alone, and the presence of the Lord is not with us.
[44]  CHAPTER SEVEN DEEP CALLS UNTO DEEP Scripture Reading: Psa 42:7; Mark 4:5-6; Isa 39:1-6; 2 Cor 12:1-4; Acts 5:1-5
[45]  Only a call from the depths can provoke a response from the depths.
[46]  Writing to the Corinthians, Paul said, "To boast is necessary, though indeed not expedient" 2 Cor 12:1 .
[47]  He admitted that it was "not profitable" Gk. for himself to write what he wrote in 2 Corinthians 12.
[48]  But for the sake of others he had to do it; he was obliged to speak of "visions and revelations of the Lord."
[49]  He wrote, "I know a man who is himself in Christ, fourteen years ago whether in the body I do not know, or outside the body I do not know; God knows such a one was caught away to the third heaven" v. 2 . He did not divulge this experience until fourteen years later.
[50]  CHAPTER EIGHT TWO KINDS OF OFFERINGS Scripture Reading: Gen 3:7, 21; 2:15; 4:1-8; Rom 8:6-8; Phil 3:3-4
[51]  But what God says to His children in these chapters is actually more than what He says to the unbelievers.
[52]  Through these few chapters of the Bible, God shows us the way He has established for us to walk in.
[53]  Romans 8:7 says, "Because the mind set on the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, for neither can it be."
[54]  The man who minds the flesh is the natural man, the original man, the man who is according to his natural birth.
[55]  Yet the Word of God tells us not only that the fleshly man sins but also that the fleshly man attempts to do good, because verse 8 says, "And those who are in the flesh cannot please God."
[56]  Regardless of how man serves God through his flesh, the result is always the same he cannot please God.
[57]  Therefore, our greatest service to God is not how much we can do for Him or how much we can accomplish for Him but how much we can die.
[58]  However, this does not mean that we only have to adopt an attitude of looking to God, believing in God, and waiting and trusting in God, when we come before Him.
[59]  They may say, "In the future I have to learn to be more humble and gentle before God.
[60]  CHAPTER NINE IDLE WORDS LEAKING LIFE Scripture Reading: Prov 13:3; 15:4; Matt 12:34, 36-37
[61]  If a water container has a hole, the water inside will leak away.
[62]  It is not a question of whether or not there is water in the container but whether there are holes.
[63]  CHAPTER TEN A POOR MAN Scripture Reading: Rev 3:17 ONE
[64]  Among God's children, there is a problem of a Laodicean attitude and a Laodicean heart.
[65]  A man who thinks that he is rich but, in reality, is poor has a Laodicean attitude and a Laodicean heart.
[66]  In spiritual matters, the matter of having or not having is easy to resolve, but the matter of being poor or being rich is not as easy to resolve.
[67]  Those who have nothing can easily see God, but those who have a little do not easily see God.
[68]  Many people have nothing before God, and they often meet God.
[69]  Poverty is not just a question of quantity but also a question of quality.
[70]  CHAPTER ELEVEN THE PRINCIPLE OF PRAYING THREE TIMES Scripture Reading: Matt 26:44; 2 Cor 12:8
[71]  A key to prayer is to pray "three times" to the Lord.
[72]  "Three" does not refer literally to the number three; it merely signifies multiplicity.
[73]  The Lord Jesus prayed to God three times in Gethsemane, and when God answered His prayer, He stopped praying.
[74]  Paul also prayed three times to the Lord, and when he received an answer from the Lord, he stopped praying.
[75]  It means that we have to pray until we are through and until God has answered us.
[76]  IN THE CHURCH MEETINGS Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 14:26-33 ONE
[77]  Ephesians 2:22 shows us that the church is being built together to be a dwelling place of God in spirit.
[78]  The whole church gathering together is the dwelling place of God.
[79]  When we become God's dwelling place, there must be light among us because God manifests His glory through His dwelling place.
[80]  If we meet in a proper way, we can look to God to shine forth His light among us, and we can look to Him to speak to us.
[81]  First, those who do not "have" think that they "have."
[82]  In many instances, a child of God is not the kind of person he wants to be, yet he insists on speaking as if he were such a one.
[83]  In reality, God has never said anything to him or worked in him.
[84]  In our daily walk, we should have constant communion with God and look to Him for His work in us, so that we will "have" something and be able to supply the church with what we have.
[85]  What we give to the church should not be something that we come up with on the spur of the moment or something that is according to our own good idea but something we have in our daily life, that is, something God has given us during our daily life.
[86]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN HEART AND LIGHT Scripture Reading: Matt 5:8; 6:21-23; 2 Cor 3:16; Psa 73:1, 13, 16-17, 25
[87]  These passages all speak of the heart and light.
[88]  Let us consider the relationship between the heart and light.
[89]  Matthew 5:8 says, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God."
[90]  It is not God's will that we should constantly have problems; God does not wish to see us remain in darkness.
[91]  Second, we have God's speaking, His shining, or His revelation.
[92]  God spoke to Moses from the midst of the two cherubim.
[93]  In the matter of fellowship, God stressed the fact that fellowship and communion with Moses was based on the mercy seat.
[94]  However, He has no intention that we forget the cherubim; He has no intention that we forget His glory.
[95]  CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE LIFE OF THE ALTAR AND THE TENT Scripture Reading: Gen 12:7-8; 13:3, 4, 18
[96]  The life of a Christian is the life of the altar and the tent.
[97]  The altar is toward God while the tent is toward the world.
[98]  In His presence, God requires that His children have an altar and on the earth that they have a tent.
[99]  Genesis 12:8 says, "And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent."
[100]  THE WINE MINGLED WITH GALL Scripture Reading: Matt 27:34; Luke 23:33-34
[101]  When the Lord Jesus was led by man to Golgotha where he was about to be crucified, "They gave Him wine to drink, mingled with gall.
[102]  CHAPTER EIGHTEEN THE WASHING OF FEET Scripture Reading: John 13:1-14
[103]  The Gospel of John shows us clearly that water signifies life.
[104]  John 4 tells us how, after we have received life, it will become a spring in us welling up into eternal life.
[105]  Water is not just a spring welling up from within us to satisfy us; it does not just add strength to us to flow into others as rivers of living waters; it can also give us refreshment, new feeling, and new help.
[106]  In theory we know that the water the Lord gives us will become in us a spring welling up into eternal life, but have we not felt that this spring of living water is not welling up constantly?
[107]  After the Lord Jesus washed His disciples' feet, He also commanded them, "You also ought to wash one another's feet."
[108]  This shows us that the church needs to continue the work of foot-washing.
[109]  CHAPTER NINETEEN IN REST SHALL BE YOUR STRENGTH Scripture Reading: Luke 10:38-42; Isa 30:15; Phil 4:6-7; Matt 11:29 ONE
[110]  One day as our Lord came to a certain village, a sister named Martha received Him into her home.
[111]  She loved our Lord and wanted to do many things for Him in order to please Him.
[112]  The tabernacle in the Old Testament was divided into the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies.
[113]  Within the Holy of Holies was the ark in which God dwelt.
[114]  In the New Testament, God speaks through His servant declaring that we are the temple of God 1 Cor 3:16 .
[115]  OF THE BOOK OF ACTS Scripture Reading: Acts 28:30-31; Rev 1:11-12, 20
[116]  When we come to the end of many of these books, we can say that the book is finished.
[117]  There are fifty chapters in Genesis, and when we come to the end, we sense that we have come to the end. The Gospel of Matthew has twenty-eight chapters.
[118]  When we come to chapter twenty-eight, we feel that we have come to the end. When we come to the Romans 16, we also feel that this is the end. When we read Revelation 22, we also feel that this is the end.
[119]  CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE THE SEED OF GOD Scripture Reading: Matt 13:3, 19, 24, 37; John 12:24-26 ONE
[120]  Of the seven parables in Matthew 13, the first two are the parable of the sower and the parable of the good seed and the tares.
[121]  In the first parable, the Lord told the disciples that the seed sown by the sower is the word of God, which is the word of the kingdom.
[122]  In the first parable, the seed is the word of the kingdom, which is the word of God.
[123]  God sows with the purpose of reaping a harvest.
[124]  Let us now consider the principle of God's harvesting.
[125]  This word refers to the Lord dying for us and dispensing His life into us.
[126]  WITH GOOD THINGS Scripture Reading: Luke 1:53; Matt 5:6; 2 Kings 4:1-6
[127]  One is the failure to know themselves, and the other is the failure to know the riches of the Lord.
[128]  It is an amazing thing that in our experience the Holy Spirit can empty us.
[129]  Many genuine Christians have passed through such an experience.
[130]  When we first became a Christian, we considered ourselves to be rather good and capable in everything.
[131]  But after some time we noticed that the life we were living was short of the Christian standard; we realized that we had failed and could not go on anymore.
[132]  Consequently, we felt dissatisfied, and we prayed for God to fill us up and make us obedient.
[133]  The Bible never tells us to imitate the deeds of others' faith even though it tells us to imitate others' faith Heb 6:12; 13:7 .
[134]  When we compare the difficulty God has given us with the strength we now have, we will realize that there is no way we can overcome.
[135]  CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE SPIRITUAL PROGRESS Scripture Reading: Luke 14:26-27, 33
[136]  CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE Scripture Reading: John 8:32
[137]  Nineteen hundred years ago, Pilate asked, "What is truth?"
[138]  Why is there a vast difference in what we are before the Lord and what we are in the world?
[139]  This means that our condition does not match the truth that we hold onto before God.
[140]  In order to see the truth, we need God's enlightening.
[141]  Psalm 43:3 says, "Send forth Your light and Your truth."
[142]  FROM THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Heb 4:12-13 ONE
[143]  The dividing of the soul from the spirit is a very important thing.
[144]  First Corinthians 3 mentions the matter of the building, which refers to one's work.
[145]  Some build with gold, silver, and precious stones in their work, while others build with wood, grass, and stubble in their work.
[146]  In the Bible, gold, silver, and precious stones refer to things that are of God.
[147]  CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX FEAR AND GODLINESS Scripture Reading: Psa 25:12, 14; 2 Cor 7:1; 1 Tim 3:16; 4:7-9; Titus 2:12
[148]  There are two words in the Bible which are quite familiar to us.
[149]  By the grace of God, we would like to share a little of what we have learned concerning these matters.
[150]  First Timothy 3:16 says, "And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh..."
[151]  CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN THE CONDITION OF OUR HEART Scripture Reading: Psa 19:14; Acts 13:22-23 ONE
[152]  Both of the above passages are related to David.
[153]  Psalm 19:14 is a prayer of David, while Acts 13:22-23 is a description of David.
[154]  He prayed that he would not only be kept in his words outwardly, but also be acceptable to God in his thoughts inwardly.
[155]  CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT GOD NEEDING MAN Scripture Reading: Isa 6:8; 1 Sam 1:10-11; John 7:17 ONE
[156]  God needs man to cooperate with Him before He can fulfill His eternal plan.
[157]  God could only rest after He had created man; He could not rest without man.
[158]  There is a very precious thought in the Bible: God treasures man's aspiration for Him.
[159]  The story of Moses shows us that he had an aspiration to save the Israelites on God's behalf.
[160]  Although he was not used by God until he was eighty years old, his aspiration did not begin at the age of eighty; it was there when he was forty years old.
[161]  God gained Samuel and accomplished His purpose through him in that age because Samuel's mother had an aspiration toward God concerning her son.
[162]  We must understand that in the spiritual realm, "time" works for "eternity."
[163]  Our service in time is to prepare us for eternity.
[164]  God has put us in time in order to train us and make us useful for eternity.
[165]  According to Matthew 25, when the Lord comes back, He will say to the faithful slaves, "You were faithful over a few things; I will set you over many things" v. 21 . If we learn our lesson well, the Lord will entrust us with greater works when He comes back.
[166]  However, Revelation 22 tells us that we will serve God in eternity v. 3 . God places us among His children today in order for us to serve together with all of them.
[167]  In Matthew 16 when the Lord Jesus "began to show to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed" v. 21 , Peter took Him aside and rebuked Him, saying, "God be merciful to You, Lord! This shall by no means happen to You!" v. 22 . The Lord said, "Get behind Me, Satan!..you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men" v. 23 . Following this He said, "If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me" v. 24 . What is the "self," and where is it hiding? From this portion of the Scripture, we see that the "self" is hidden behind man's opinion.
[168]  CHAPTER THIRTY SERVING GOD IN THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: John 4:23-24; Rom 1:9; 8:6 ONE
[169]  Among God's children, there are many who have a strong desire to serve the Lord yet who regretfully have not found the proper way to serve Him.
[170]  They are not off in doctrine, and they are not wrong in their conduct.
[171]  God's children need to know God's will, and they should know His will.
[172]  It is not right for us to be ignorant of His will.
[173]  In other words, if a man does not have light and if he does not see anything or know anything, it means that he is not following the Lord.
[174]  If a man has life, if he abides in the Lord, and if His word abides in him, he will know what God wants and also what God does not want.
[175]  Some may say, "How can God's will be that simple?"
[176]  Brothers and sisters, I am not saying that God's will can be understood without pursuing it.
[177]  I am saying that God's will is in us also; it is in us together with His life.
[178]  This word is not for everyone but for those who are regenerated, who have the mind of Christ, and who know in a serious way the meaning of abiding in the Lord and having the Lord's word abide in them.
[179]  CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO A DEEPER JOY Scripture Reading: Isa 49:4-5; Matt 11:25-30 ONE
[180]  Isaiah is one of the prophets who prophesied a great deal concerning Christ.
[181]  Following this, our Lord said something as a kind of explanation.
[182]  It explained why He could say what He said.
[183]  He said, "All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one fully knows the Son except the Father" v. 27a . As long as the Father knew, that was enough.
[184]  He also said, "Neither does anyone fully know the Father except the Son and he to whom the Son wills to reveal Him" v. 27b . Only those who are willing to be known by God alone will know God, and only those who know God can lead others to the knowledge of God.
[185]  Brothers and sisters, if we drop all the things that are in our heart, we will know Him, and we will be able to lead others to the knowledge of Him; our heart will be pure, and those who have a pure heart will see God Matt 5:8 .
[186]  Brothers and sisters, if you do not have rest or joy, it is because there is something within you that you will not let go.
[187]  It may not be certain particular things, but there is always something.
[188]  CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE THE ARK THE CENTER OF THE TABERNACLE Scripture Reading: Exo 25:10-22
[189]  The ark occupies a very important place in the Bible.
[190]  When God ordered Moses to build the tabernacle, the ark was the first thing that was mentioned.
[191]  Let us consider the history of the ark a little.
[192]  This shows us the relationship between the ark and the Israelites, and from it we can find the relationship between Christ and us.
[193]  Joshua 3:10-17 says, "And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you....Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan....And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the Lord, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand upon a heap.
[194]  And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see; and ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the Lord, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep; that the Lord called Samuel" 3:1-4 .
[195]  What happened after the ark was taken to the land of the Philistines?
[196]  First Samuel 5 says, "And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Ebenezer unto Ashdod.
[197]  When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.
[198]  After twenty years, David was raised up as king.
[199]  Once he came to the throne, he ordered that the ark be taken to Jerusalem.
[200]  First Chronicles 13:1-3 says, "And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader...let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we inquired not at it in the days of Saul."
[201]  "And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart....And David and all the house of Israel played before the Lord on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals" 2 Sam 6:3, 5 .
[202]  And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah, and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God....And David was afraid of the Lord that day, and said, How shall the ark of the Lord come to me?
[203]  There was still another story related to the ark.
[204]  First Kings 3:4 says, "And the king Solomon went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar."
[205]  He prayed for wisdom, and the Lord granted his request; He even gave him what he did not ask for.
[206]  "And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants" v. 15 . Read again this account in 2 Chronicles 1:3-4: "So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the Lord had made in the wilderness.
[207]  We should focus on a few expressions from the two verses we have read in Romans 2: "For he is not...who is one outwardly...But he is...who is one inwardly"; "in spirit, not in letter"; "not from men, but from God."
[208]  Here are a few contrasts: "outwardly" versus "inwardly"; "spirit" versus "letter"; and "from men" versus "from God."
[209]  A man receives this life through knowing the Lord Jesus and through knowing Him as the Son of God and as the Christ of God.
[210]  In John 3, the Lord Jesus discussed the question of regeneration with Nicodemus, who said, "We know that You have come from God as a teacher."
[211]  The Lord answered him, saying, "Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God" vv.
[212]  CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE LIFE AND FEELING Scripture Reading: John 1:4; Rom 8:12; 1 Cor 12:26
[213]  OF THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Rom 12:3-5; 1 Cor 12:25-27; Eph 4:12-13, 15-16
[214]  In the previous chapter, Life and Feeling, we saw that the presence of feelings proves the existence of life.
[215]  In this chapter we want to go on to consider the meaning of the feeling of the Body of Christ.
[216]  If we have Body-consciousness, we immediately will see that the Body is one.
[217]  Once we see this, we will not be individualistic in our spiritual work.
[218]  If we want to participate in the Lord's work, we need to deal with this one matter individualistic works.
[219]  Once a person has a feeling for the Body, he will see his place in the Body at the same time.
[220]  In other words, he will see that he is only a member in the Body.
[221]  CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN PLEASING THE LORD Scripture Reading: Gal 1:6-10; 1 Thes 2:4; 2 Cor 5:9
[222]  Every servant of God must have a fundamental attitude of pleasing the Lord.
[223]  When Paul spoke this word, on the one hand, he was very grieved because the Galatian believers had turned away from his gospel so soon, and on the other hand, this word expressed his serious attitude towards the Lord.
[224]  When Paul went to Galatia the first time to preach the gospel, he told the people there that a man is saved by the grace of the Lord and that salvation is through faith and not through the law.
[225]  The problem with them was that they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God v. 43 . Brothers and sisters, are we like this? Do we love the glory of men more than the glory of God? Some Christians dare not confess the name of the Lord Jesus in public.
