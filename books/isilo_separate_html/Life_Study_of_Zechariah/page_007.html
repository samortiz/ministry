Both of these visions are strong consolations with sweet promises of expectation to the suffering Israel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE VISION OF A MAN AS THE ANGEL<br>OF JEHOVAH RIDING ON A RED HORSE<br>AND STANDING AMONG THE MYRTLE TREES<br>IN THE BOTTOMS OF THE VALLEY</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. A Man</H2><P>Verse 8a says, "I saw during the night, and behold, a man was riding upon a red horse." This Man is Christ in His humanity. To Daniel, this Man was excellent; to Zechariah, He was very sympathetic.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Angel of Jehovah</H2><P>The Man here is the Angel of Jehovah (v. 11a). The Angel of Jehovah is Jehovah Himself as the Triune God (Exo. 3:2a, 4-6, 13-15). The Angel of Jehovah is also Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God (Col. 2:9) and as the sent One of God (John 5:36-38; 6:38-39). The Angel of Jehovah is also the Angel of God who escorted and protected Israel on their way from Egypt to the promised land (Exo. 23:20; 32:34; Judg. 6:19-24; Isa. 63:9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Riding on a Red Horse</H2><P>The Man in this vision is riding on a red horse (Zech. 1:8a). In Revelation 6 the red horse signifies war, which always involves bloodshed, but here the red horse signifies Christ's swift move in His redemption by the shedding of His blood.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> </body></html>
