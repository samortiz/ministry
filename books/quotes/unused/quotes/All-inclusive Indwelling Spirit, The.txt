The Bible is a book of mystery, containing at least five main mysteries-God, the universe, man, the church, and the future
The Bible reveals the mystery of God the mystery of the universe the mystery of man the mystery of the church and the mystery of the future
Within the Bible, Romans 8 is the mystery of all the mysteries, for it particularly unveils and explains these five mysteries
Verse 11 says, 'He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you'
Verses 9 and 11 mention the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead
Revelation 45 and 56 mention the seven Spirits of God which are seven lamps of fire burning before the throne and the seven eyes of the Lamb
According to New Testament Greek, the English word of in phrases such as the law of the Spirit of life indicates apposition
Altogether four persons and two things are in apposition in Romans 82 9 and 11God Christ the Spirit the resurrecting One the law and life
The law of the Spirit of life, which is uniquely revealed in Romans 8, is nothing less than the Triune God in motion
Traditional systematic theology says that God is ever the same, that God never changes from eternity to eternity
God took one step in incarnation to become a man, and He took a second step in resurrection to become a life-giving Spirit
He has resurrected our spirit, and now He is resurrecting our mind, emotion, will, and body by infusing us with the divine life
No matter how much we are taught to be a good husband, wife, son, daughter, or roommate, we cannot do it by our natural strength
God's work of infusing us with Himself as our life is carried out by the all-inclusive Spirit, who indwells us
A living person the allinclusive Spirit who is the Spirit of God the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of the resurrecting One indwells us
A wedding or engagement ring is a sign to others that the wearer is not available but is fully occupied by another person
Throughout the day we must have our mouth, heart, spirit, and entire being open, calling on the Lord in every place
At the moment we repented, believed in the Lord, and called on His name, the indwelling Spirit was installed within us
Even if we call softly from a believing heart, we will receive an infusion of God as life from the indwelling Spirit
When we thus experience God as the all-inclusive Spirit, this proves that God is real, true, experiential, and practical
When we pray in this way, the life supply will be infused into our being, and we will experience, enjoy, and grow with Christ
Within us is a mysterious and marvelous law of the Spirit of the divine life, which frees us from the law of sin and of death
When we set our mind on our regenerated spirit, which possesses the divine life, our mind becomes zoe, divine life
We are regenerated in our spirit with the divine life, and then we are transformed in our mind also with the divine life
Finally Romans 811 says He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you
Nothing is more precious than these aspects of the all-inclusive Spirit, which meet our every need and completely satisfy us
Before the foundation of the world, God knew each one of us and loved us in spite of our flaws, defects, and sinfulness
God foreknew us, and because He loved us, He predestinated us to be conformed to the image of His firstborn Son
Our sinful nature and all our defects will be swallowed up as we are transformed into the same image from glory to glory
According to our religious concepts, we may like to carry ourselves with a certain demeanor or prefer a certain kind of church meeting
We also need to see that God in Romans 8 is different than He was in Genesis 1 and even different than in the four Gospels
God in Romans 8 has passed through creation, incarnation, human living, an all-inclusive death, and resurrection
After all these procedures, or processes, He has presented Himself to us as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit
The goal of the Spirit's working within us is to renew, transform, and conform us in every avenue and corner of our being
Romans 8 concerns the wonderful, all-inclusive life-giving Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God
Similarly we can see whether someone has zoe the divine life in his or her spirit mind and body by the manifestations of the divine life
The way we listen to a healthy, proper message in a meeting may be a manifestation of life or death in our mind
When we are full of life, although we may not do anything, our being will express life and minister life to those around us
Even if he is successful in improving his behavior by his self-effort, he will not have peace, joy, satisfaction, or refreshment deep within
We will spontaneously have a proper relationship with everyone around us and we will have peace joy rest satisfaction and refreshment within
If we are simply a willing receiver of the life supply, life will work out everything and will conform us to the image of Christ
By birth we have only bios, the outward physical life, in our bodies, and psuche, the inward soul-life, in our souls
In John 4:24 the Lord said, 'God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness'
The all-inclusive Spirit brings the divine life into us, just as the current of electricity brings electricity into a building
The current of electricity is electricity itself, for the current of electricity and electricity are inseparable
Many Christians today emphasize spiritual gifts such as speaking in tongues, but the greatest gift is the Triune God as life
We have the life of God but not the Godhead, just as a child has the father's life but not the father's position
Because God had accomplished everything before we were born of Him, all His processes are the qualifications of our status
Some may point out that this term does not occur in traditional theology, which is based on the early Christian creeds
The all-inclusive Spirit is the ultimate expression of the Triune God, and He is waiting for man to receive Him
Luke 2:46-47 says, 'They found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them and questioning them
Although we have the same life that was in the Lord, we do not always live an excellent life full of human virtues as the Lord did
In Christs death everything natural was terminated and He is now living in resurrection to germinate all the believers with the divine life
To have the real experience of Romans 8 is to live a life full of human virtues and the divine glory in resurrection
Ethics may be compared to copper, but the life that is in Christ Jesus is like gold, which is brighter and more valuable than copper
They think that we need to improve ourselves, and because we cannot make it, we need to seek God's help through prayer
Many Christians misinterpret the words eternal life in the Bible to mean a condition of living eternally in a physical paradise
Although we are human beings, God imparts His life into us that we may live as human beings by the divine life
The virtues taught by Confucius are produced entirely by the human life, but the virtues taught by the Bible are produced by the divine life
Perhaps some are still not clear about the difference between being virtuous by the human life and living by the divine life
Even if we are quite virtuous, as long as we are proud, we cannot build, minister life, or supply anything of the Lord to others
When we touch them, we will sense not that we are meeting God but that we are meeting proud, self-exalted people
God's desire and goal is that we live by this life and minister this life to others for the building up of the church
If we live by our natural human life, even if we are proper and virtuous, we will damage the church life by our pride
The church life should not be a social life by the human life but a Body life, the life of the Body of Christ, by the divine life
It is possible for us to be grafted together with God just as it is possible to graft a pear tree with an apple tree
Grafting is not merely a joining of two lives but a mingling, because the two lives mutually enter into each other to live together as one
Married ones know that it is hard for a couple to live together, yet a couple living together is not as strict as grafting
God does not want us to commit suicide, but the Bible charges us strongly to deny, put off, and crucify our soul-life
We must live as a proper human being, but our old, natural life must be put aside and crucified, and we must live instead by God's life
Since we know what is the flesh, we can walk according to the spirit simply by not walking according to the flesh
We may think that some things are neutral and that it is not possible to know whether or not they are the flesh
According to the Bible, there is no third choice or neutral ground; everything is either according to the flesh or the spirit
The window being open or closed may be neutral, but for either spouse to insist on his or her preference is the flesh
We need to not only walk according to the spirit but also constantly be according to the spirit, not according to the flesh
A living according to the spirit and not according to the flesh is the realization of an inward law-the law of the Spirit of life
Being according to the flesh is like remaining on the ground, and being according to the spirit is like being in an airplane
The law of the Spirit of life in our mingled spirit has the power to overcome the law of sin and of death in our flesh
If we choose to be according to the spirit, the law of the Spirit of life will spontaneously free us from the law of sin and of death
Every morning as soon as we wake up and every night before going to bed, we can practice to declare our choice to be according to the spirit
The Bible teaches us to habitually and continually set our mind not on the things of the flesh but on the things of the Spirit
The two spirits, the divine Spirit with our human spirit, connect all the things concerning Christ to our mind
The only way to protect our mind and our being from dark things is to be filled with pure things, the things of Christ
Especially when we are not busy we need to exercise to fill our mind with the things of the Spirit the things concerning the glorious Christ
If our flesh says, 'Make a phone call to So-and-so,' making this phone call is a practice of our body that needs to be put to death
If we consider our basic intentions, we will discover that nearly every practice of our body needs to be put to death
When we feel that we do not know what to do, it is because we are not putting to death the practices of our body by the Spirit
The law of the apple life causes the tree to grow and to produce apples with the proper shape, color, and taste
The arrangement and proportions of our bodies are all generally consistent because of the regulation of the law of the physical human life
When we eat, we do not worry about how to digest what we have eaten, because the law of our physical life causes our body to digest the food
Everything that is according to this law is normal and healthy, and anything that is contrary to this law is abnormal and a sickness
We must be controlled and directed by the law of the Spirit of life to experience a genuine and normal Christian life
In the New Testament the title God refers to God the Father, who is the Originator, source, and origination of all things
It is often possible to recognize that two people are a son and a father because the son looks very much like the father
The Triune God reaches us by being the Spirit, just as electricity from a power plant reaches a building by being a current
The current and the electricity are inseparable, for the current of electricity is simply electricity in motion
According to Romans 8, the Spirit is the Spirit of life, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of the resurrecting One
In Genesis 1:1 God had not yet accomplished His work of creation, incarnation, crucifixion, redemption, and resurrection
Genesis 1 may be likened to an empty plot of land, and Romans 8 may be likened to the same plot of land with a new building and garden on it
He ascended to the heavens, where He was enthroned, made Lord of all, and given the headship of the entire universe
Today the Lord is not only with His church but also indwelling all His believers as the Spirit of the processed Triune God
He first resurrected our spirit at the time of our regeneration and He is now resurrecting our entire inner beingour mind emotion and will
He is also resurrecting our mortal body with the divine life to make us a new creation, a being altogether in resurrection
He has passed through all the necessary processes-incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
Our Christian life should be lived not according to our nature, culture, ethics, religion, or habit but according to the indwelling Spirit
In other words, after being saved and regenerated, we should live not by our natural life but by God as the divine life
According to Romans 8, the processed Triune God as the Spirit is indwelling us to make us one with Him so that we may express Him
To be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith'
The Father grants us to be strengthened in our spirit by the Spirit so that Christ the Son may make His home in our heart
Otherwise, He will be confined by us in our spirit and will be unable to settle in our entire inner being to make His home in our heart
We need to see that the indwelling of the processed Triune God is not a mere theory or doctrine but a real and present fact
If we were given a precious diamond, when others saw us, they would realize that we had received something extraordinary
Wherever one of the Godhead is, the other two are as well, because the three of the Godhead not only coexist but also coinhere
In Romans 8 the indwelling Spirit is called the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of the resurrecting One
We can say that the Spirit in Romans 8 is the all-inclusive Spirit as the ultimate consummation and application of the Triune God
The current of electricity is the application and reaching of electricity from a distant power plant to a building
For this reason, the Lord said, 'God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness'
The Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit is within us for us to experience and enjoy by taking Him as our life and our person
We may be familiar with the imparting of gifts and power to the believers, but Romans 8 does not mention gifts or power
For the Spirit to indwell us, we must give Him the permission to settle within us and saturate our inner being
Concerning the things of God, our bodies are weak and dying, but the resurrecting One gives life to our dying bodies
A brother may be saved for years and know the Bible quite well, but one day he may be down and weak in his spirit, mind, and body
When we are in this kind of situation, it is not because something is wrong but rather because something is missing
Perhaps twenty minutes before, we were tired in every part of our being and did not have the strength or the energy to go to the meeting
As we continually breathe in the Spirit as life and allow Him to spread into all our being, more and more of Christ is added into us
It is more than believing and trusting in an objective God and more than merely receiving gifts or power from God for our use or strength
We need more than the knowledge of an objective God in our mind; we need to have the element of the subjective God added into our being
Whenever we feel weak in our spirit, mind, or body toward the things of God, we need to call on the name of the Lord
We need to realize that God is in us and that there is no need for us to do anything since He has accomplished everything necessary
While we are growing with the element of the divine life, this life has an automatic function, the law of life
While we are growing with this life element, the law of life works in us automatically to shape us, conform us, into the image of Christ
The Body of Christ, the fullness of Christ, the new man, and the mutual habitation of God and man issue from our experience of this life
Ultimately, this life will prepare the bride of Christ, which will cause the Lord to come back and usher us into the next age
Romans 8 is mysterious and abstract, yet it is a crucial chapter in the Bible, for it reveals the focal point of God's economy
According to God's purpose, He created the heavens, the earth, and millions of items with human beings as the center
Animals have no thought about God, but throughout history and regardless of race, people have always worshipped
According to Matthew 13:3, the Lord came as a sower to sow Himself as the seed of life into the soil of man's heart to grow there
Verse 60 says, 'Many therefore of His disciples, when they heard this, said, This word is hard; who can hear it'?
Our sins are forgiven because He died on the cross to accomplish redemption and shed His blood to wash away our sins
He solved the problem of sin and sins by His death, and now as the life-giving Spirit, He is in our spirit to be our life
Since God has accomplished all this He is no longer merely God the Creator as in Genesis 1 not yet having passed through all His processes
Perhaps we have all thought that it would have been wonderful to touch Jesus, wash His feet, serve Him, and accompany Him
Of caring for theology, which is a set of human concepts about God, we should care for the pure revelation of God in the Scriptures
In John 7:38 Jesus said, 'He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water'
Further God in Christ lived on earth for thirtythree and a half years passing through all kinds of experiences and sufferings of human life
In Genesis 1 God was merely God, but today He is both God and man; He is fully God and fully man, the real God and a true man
Because He had not accomplished redemption, the requirements of His righteousness, His holiness, and His glory had not been fulfilled
The Lord died to prepare the way so that He could bring us not into heaven but into the righteous, holy, and glorious God
Because we are genuine Christians, Christ has come into us to be our life, and we should live Him all the time
Because we have received the Lord's mercy and grace, we may hate sin, not commit gross sins, and even not love the world
The genuine Christian life is not merely a sinless, perfect, and ethical life but a life that is Christ Himself
Because the book of Romans is mysterious and abstract, through the years many Bible teachers have not touched it adequately
We need to realize that with regard to life, whatever is the most mysterious and abstract is the most precious
The preciousness of a human being is not physical, visible, or material but something invisible within our physical body called life
When most Christians think of God's salvation, they mainly consider it to be a matter of the forgiveness of sins and salvation from hell
Our conscience is touched when we first receive the gospel, and we are enlightened and convicted, realizing that we are sinful
Regrettably, many genuine Christians do not realize that within them is the powerful law of the Spirit of life
In order to overcome the law of sin and of death, we need the law of the Spirit of life, which has been installed in every believer
The Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself, and the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead is the resurrecting One
The all-inclusive Spirit is the ultimate consummation and application of the Triune God-the Triune God reaching us
Whereas verse 4 indicates that we need to walk according to the spirit, verse 5 says that we need to be according to the spirit
No matter whether we are in a meeting or at home, in every place and at every time, we need to exercise our spirit
If we are in physical darkness in a house or building, it is only because we have not turned on the proper switch
Once electricity has been installed in a building, there is no need to petition the power plant to mercifully send light; this does not work
The law of the Spirit of life, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and the resurrecting Spirit have been installed in every believer
Although our situation may not be very difficult, soon after we wake in the morning, thoughts come in that cause us to be anxious
Such thoughts, which may concern our job, family, or safety, come from Satan through our troublesome, unbridled mind
The way to deal with such thoughts is to recognize where they come from and then choose to exercise our spirit
Before we accept any thought, we should exercise our spirit by calling on the Lord and worshipping, thanking, praising, and exalting Him
If we practice this, we will not be loose, natural, or short-tempered, because our spirit will be on the alert
We sometimes live as if we do not have the law of the Spirit of life or the all-inclusive Spirit within us until we come to a meeting
If we do not exercise our spirit or release our spirit until we step through the door of the meeting hall this will be a kind of performance
The natural mind is very troublesome and hard to control, but we can make our mind a spiritual mind, a mind of the spirit
Because we have a great deposit-the law of the Spirit of life and the all-inclusive Spirit-within us, we now owe nothing to the flesh
To put the practices of the body to death means to kill our old habits, which is to no longer do anything according to our old habits
Perhaps we excuse our slowness or quickness, saying that there is nothing we can do about it, because we were born that way
