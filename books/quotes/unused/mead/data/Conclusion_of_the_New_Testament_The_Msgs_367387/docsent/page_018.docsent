   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3 Being Holy, Guileless, Undefiled,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Separated from Sinners,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Having Become Higher than the Heavens,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>and Being Perfected Forever</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hebrews 7:26 says that such a High Priest was also fitting to us, holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ is holy, guileless, undefiled, and separated from sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As such a perfect One, He surely is fitting to us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Having a fallen and corrupted nature, we need such a High Priest to save us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 26 also says that He has become higher than the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In His ascension, Christ has passed through the heavens 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now He is not only in heaven 9:24 but also higher than the heavens, far above all the heavens Eph 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>None of our troubles is higher than the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because our High Priest is higher than the heavens, He is able to rescue us and save us to the uttermost Heb 7:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 28 says that the Son of God has been perfected forever.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This verse proves that the Son of God must not be simply the only begotten Son but also the firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The only begotten Son of God needed no perfection, because He was eternally perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But in order for Christ to be the firstborn Son of God, He needed a great deal of perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He had to put on humanity in His incarnation and live on earth for thirty-three and a half years, passing through all the experiences of human living.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then He needed to pass through death, tasting, overcoming, subduing, and swallowing up death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After that, He had to come out of death in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After His resurrection, He, as the firstborn Son of God with humanity, was fully perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now He is not just the eternal only begotten Son of God but also the perfected firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, now He is completely perfected, equipped, and qualified to be our divine High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may trust in Him with our full confidence because He has been so perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Made Like Us in All Things,</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Able to Sympathize with Our Weaknesses,</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Having Been Tried in All Respects Like Us,</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>yet without Sin</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 15 of chapter 4 says, We do not have a High Priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all respects like us, yet without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verses 17 and 18 of chapter 2 say, Hence He should have been made like His brothers in all things that He might become a merciful and faithful High Priest in the things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For being tempted in that which He Himself has suffered, He is able to help those who are being tempted.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These verses indicate that Christ has been made like us in all things, able to sympathize with our weaknesses, having been tried in all respects like us, yet without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although Christ is so high and capable, He is able to sympathize with our weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In a very real sense, He is the same as we are in all respects, except that He is without sin.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As our High Priest, Christ has been tried in all respects like us, but without sin 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Since He has been tried, He is qualified and able to help us who are being tried 2:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In all His trials, He was never stained with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He suffered the trials without being touched by sin.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is truly equipped to help us to pass through trials and to keep us from any entanglement of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As the One who has been tried in all respects like us, our High Priest, Christ, is able to sympathize with our weaknesses 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is easily touched with the feeling of our weaknesses and quickly enters into a fellow-suffering with us in our weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whatever happens to us and whatever suffering we may have, He feels it with us and sympathizes with us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In 5:2 we are told that a high priest was able to exercise compassion toward the ignorant and erring since he also is encompassed with weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Greek in this verse implies a feeling toward the ignorant and erring that is neither too severe nor too tolerant.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To exercise compassion is to be moderate or tender in judging their situation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The thought in this verse is a continuation of the thought in 4:15.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Though not encompassed with weakness like the high priest taken from among men, Christ as our High Priest was tempted in all respects like us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, being touched with the feeling of our weaknesses, He is able to exercise compassion toward us, the ignorant and erring ones.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ can be touched with the feeling of our weaknesses because the ascended, heavenly Christ is still with us and is therefore able to be touched with our feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Day by day we have the feeling of weaknesses, of infirmities, of being weak and inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But there is a High Priest who is able to be touched with our feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, He must be One who is not only in the heavens but also with us in our spirit 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is possible because today Christ is not only the ascended Christ in the heavens but also the Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, today He is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christ is a great High Priest who can always be touched with our feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Whatever we feel, He feels.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He is being touched continually with our feeling, because He is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He sympathizes with everything that we feel, because He is one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Today we need to appropriate Christ experientially by realizing that the heavenly Christ as the living Spirit dwells in our spirit for us to touch.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must learn how to discern our spirit from the other parts of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then we will meet Christ in our spirit, be in His presence, and experience Him as the High Priest who sympathizes with our feeling all the time.</S>
