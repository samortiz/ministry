In the Ultimate Consummation,<br>the New Jerusalem Being God's Redeemed People to Be the Tabernacle to God for Him to Enjoy<br>His Redeemed People, and the Redeeming Triune God<br>to Be the Temple to God's Redeemed People<br>for Them to Enjoy Their Redeeming<br>Triune God in Eternity</H2><P>In the ultimate consummation, the New Jerusalem will be God's redeemed people to be the tabernacle to God for Him to enjoy His redeemed people, and the redeeming Triune God to be the temple to God's redeemed people for them to enjoy their redeeming Triune God in eternity. Revelation 21:2 and 3 tell us that in eternity future we, God's redeemed people, will be a tabernacle to God for God to enjoy us. Then verse 22 says that the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are the temple. This indicates that the Triune God will be the temple to us for us to enjoy Him as our redeeming Triune God in eternity. Therefore, the New Jerusalem is a mutual dwelling of both God and man for their mutual enjoyment. The New Jerusalem will be a composition of God and of us. To God, we will be the New Jerusalem as the tabernacle for Him to dwell in and enjoy. To us, God will be the New Jerusalem as the temple for us to dwell in and enjoy. The enjoyment in the New Jerusalem is both God's enjoyment and our enjoyment.</P><P>We need to see the enjoyment in the New Jerusalem. In the New Jerusalem there is a flowing river, which is the river of water of life. This river is bright as crystal (Rev. 22:1). In this crystal clear river, the tree of life grows and produces twelve fruits yearly (v. 2). In the New Jerusalem, there is new fruit every month. The fruits of the tree of life will be the food of God's redeemed for eternity. Eating the fruits of the tree of life will be our enjoyment.</P><P>Today God's location is in Christ and in the church. In the coming age and in eternity, God will be located in the New Jerusalem. Do we want to see God, to find God, to meet God, and to visit God? We need to go to Christ, the church, and the New Jerusalem. To enjoy God in His house means that we must be in Christ, in the church, and eventually in the New Jerusalem. Otherwise, we will miss God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Psalmist's Initial Experience<br>of the Enjoyment of God's House</H2><P>At the beginning of the Psalms we see the psalmist's initial experience of the enjoyment of God's house.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Worshipping toward God's Holy Temple<br>in Fear of Him</H2><P>In Psalm 5:7, the psalmist said to God, "I will bow down toward Your holy temple/In fear of You." This was his experience outside of God's house.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Entering into God's House<br>in the Abundance of His Lovingkindness</H2><P>Then the psalmist spoke of entering into God's house in the abundance of His lovingkindness (Psa. 5:7). If someone had the privilege of entering into the temple on Mount Zion, he had to be under the abundance of God's lovingkindness. Actually, to enter into the temple in itself was an enjoyment of the abundance of God's lovingkindness. When we enter into God's house, we might say, "What love, what kindness, and what grace it is for me to be here in God's dwelling!" This is the enjoyment of God in His house.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_097.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_099.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Psalms &nbsp; pg 98</div><br></body></html>
