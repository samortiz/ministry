   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE FAITH, LOVE, AND HOPE IN 1 AND 2 THESSALONIANS Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 1:10; 2:19-20; 3:13; 4:17-18; 5:23; 2 Thes 2:1-8; 1 Thes 1:3; 2 Thes 1:3; 1 Tim 1:5; 2 Pet 1:1, 3-7</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Among all the Epistles written by the apostle Paul, the two to the Thessalonians are the simplest, and they are among the earliest.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Why then are these two Epistles placed toward the end of his fourteen Epistles in the arrangement of the New Testament?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I believe that the sovereignty of God is in this arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the previous messages of this series we have seen a full definition of the universal man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have clearly and thoroughly seen Christ as the Head, the church as the Body, and the way that the members of this Body should walk and live.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now after the definition of the universal man in the foregoing books of the New Testament, 1 and 2 Thessalonians show us an additional matter, the coming of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These two books are found at this juncture because the second coming of Christ is the consummation of the life of the universal man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ's coming is the consummation of the Christian life, the Christian walk, and the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A BALANCED VIEW OF THE LORD'S SECOND COMING</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These two books are arranged in a very meaningful order.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since both speak about the coming of the Lord, why is there the need of two books to relate this matter?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why is one epistle not adequate?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One of the best ways to study the Word is to compare two books, two chapters, two passages, two verses, or even two words.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>With all the matters revealed in the Scripture, there are always two aspects, two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is a principle that for anything in the universe to exist, it must have two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nothing can exist with only one side.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even a thin piece of paper has two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, there are the heavens and the earth, God and man, man and woman, inside and outside, and top and bottom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In our own physical body, most of its members are in pairs.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have two ears, two eyes, two arms, two hands, two legs, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This provides balance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we had only one leg, we could not stand for long because we would lack balance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Medical doctors tell us that our two ears are also for balance.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The two books to the Thessalonians show us the coming of the Lord in a balanced way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first book encourages the saints by the coming of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The coming of the Lord means very much to us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is our hope, our encouragement, our comfort, and our strength.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To those early Christians also, the Lord's second coming meant very much.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, whenever we are encouraged by a hope, it is easy to go too far.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may say that since the Lord will come tomorrow, we can forget about everything else.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is wrong, unbalanced, and to an extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, we need the second epistle to tell us the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, the second epistle is a balance to the first one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the main reason that there are two epistles concerning the Lord's coming.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we read them carefully, we will see the balance.</S>
