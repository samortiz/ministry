   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Turning Mental Understanding</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>into Meditation and Prayer</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is impossible for us not to receive any understanding when we contact the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There will be some amount of comprehension no matter what chapter of the Bible we read.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Once we receive some comprehension, we need to meditate on our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At this point we need to exercise our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the previous step we exercised our spirit, not our mind, to contact the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But in this step we need to involve our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, this is meditation, not wild and unrestrained thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should consider what we have touched and received and turn it into prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For example, there is no need for us to try to understand Genesis 1:1.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Spontaneously there will be a realization within us that God is the beginning and that He is the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At this juncture we can muse and consider and even turn our thoughts into prayer, saying, God, may You be the beginning in all my ways.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>May my whole life and the beginning of everything that I do be filled with Your divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this way we will be able to apply our realization of the Word to our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we do this, we are absorbing God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to learn this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Especially in the morning when we are reading the Word, we should not occupy our mind with reference books.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This will not benefit us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Instead, we should practice this fellowship by exercising our spirit to contact the living word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we contact Him, we should spontaneously turn our understanding into meditation and prayer and concentrate on absorbing God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Receiving More of God</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We also need to realize that the issue of our musing and our prayer must be more of God in our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since the Bible is God s breath, His breathing out, and His spoken word, which is God Himself, whenever we receive Him, the result should be more of God in us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should never congratulate ourselves for merely understanding some truths which we formerly did not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is not much value in this.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If the result of our coming to the Word is to receive knowledge, teaching, or truth, not the Lord Himself, our reading is a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we read the Word, the ultimate result should not merely be the acquisition of more truth but the gaining of the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are contacting the Lord, receiving the Lord, and praying to the Lord; therefore, in the end we should gain the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Let me elaborate on this point.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If in praying for our business we take our business as the subject of our prayer, we have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The subject of every prayer should be the Lord Himself, not other things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All those who take other things as the subject of their prayer err in a fundamental way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This type of prayer never makes us clear; instead, it often makes us unclear.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even if we think that we are clear, we are actually quite confused.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This type of prayer often results in a wrong impression of the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we pray, we must first set aside our business and simply touch the Lord, breathe Him in, and contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As we touch the Lord, we may feel peaceful and sense that the Lord s presence is with our business, enabling us to proceed with our business.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Or we may lack peace and not sense His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this case there is no need to pursue the matter further; we should simply drop it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This type of leading does not become clear to us as we pray about it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It becomes clear to us as we touch the Lord and gain Him in our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord becomes our very leading within us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Most brothers and sisters have the same problem in reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When they encounter problems that need to be solved, they go to the Lord to inquire concerning the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They also search the Scriptures to see what the Bible says concerning the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For example, when a brother is looking for a job, he may search the Scriptures for something related to jobs and careers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He may even use a concordance to find verses.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He may eventually say that he is clear concerning the Christian perspective about a job.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He may even say, Lord, thank You for showing me Your will.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, this brother has received merely doctrine that can be retained in his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>His mind may be somewhat corrected, taught, and educated, but this is the wrong way to read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we have a problem with our job or when we are looking for solutions to other problems, we should not make these things an issue when we go to God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord should be the subject of our prayer, and He should also be the subject of our reading.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we study the Word, we should say, Lord, I want to contact You through Your Word.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Your Word is Your very self.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should exercise our spirit to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Genesis 1 says nothing about jobs or careers.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Verse 1 simply says, In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, if we touch God and contact Him through this word, it will turn us to meditate and pray so that we can absorb God and receive Him and His element within us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We will not need to say anything related to our business.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, after reading in this way, we will sense the Lord s presence within as we proceed with our business affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>His presence will cause us to consider whether He has initiated our work and whether He is involved in it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In this light we may realize that we initiated our business, not the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We may realize that we, rather than the Lord, are the founder of our business.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He is not involved in it, but we are fully occupied with it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then the Lord may give us a clear feeling that what has not been initiated by Him is not His will.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In this way we will be clear about the Lord s will.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is not a matter of understanding the truth but of gaining the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As we contact the living Lord and as His element within us increases, He, the living God Himself, becomes our living guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He teaches us to understand God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Being Enlivened and Shining in Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Finally, if our reading of the Bible is proper, our inner being will be enlivened whenever we touch the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If our inner being is not enlivened, our reading is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God s word is living Heb 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>His words are spirit and life John 6:63 .Whenever our spirit touches the living word of God, we will surely be enlivened, refreshed, enriched, enlightened, and empowered.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In other words, when we read the Word in a proper way, our spirit will be filled after reading, our life will be strengthened, and we will be enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This enlightenment is not related to the clarity of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is an entirely different thing.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Some people become very clear in their mind after they read the Word, but their spirit remains dull.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Others may not be that clear in their mind, but they are very clear in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>They have discernment in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>For example, the friends of a new believer may try to persuade him to go to a movie.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He may decline because he is very clear in his spirit yet at the same time be unable to explain his reason for declining.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He simply knows that he should not go.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If we would learn to live in God s word and learn to contact Him through His Word, this will be our story.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Although we may not understand many things and we may not know many doctrines, our spirit is clear.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We are clear concerning what brings us into the Lord s presence and what causes us to lose His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We know when the Lord is walking with us and when He is far from us.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We know when we are being mingled with Him and when we are separated from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Even though this type of knowing is not dependent upon our understanding, there is a clear shining in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This is the normal result of reading the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>When we read the Bible, we should realize that God is contained in His Word, and we should contact it in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We should exercise our spirit to touch the living Word.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>When we touch something in the Word, we should turn it into meditation and prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Consequently, we will gain more of the Lord, absorb more of Him, and our inner being will be enlivened, refreshed, strengthened, and enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>As a result, we will gain more God and enjoy more of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>I hope that we will all learn to exercise ourselves in these two areas.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We should exercise to have the kind of prayer we described in the previous chapter, and we should exercise to read the Word as described in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We should absorb God, gain Him, and enjoy Him through praying and reading.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>If we do this, we will express much glory, riches, and divine fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Furthermore, the church will rise to a higher plane.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>May we be faithful to continually learn to take this way and to live this life.</S>
