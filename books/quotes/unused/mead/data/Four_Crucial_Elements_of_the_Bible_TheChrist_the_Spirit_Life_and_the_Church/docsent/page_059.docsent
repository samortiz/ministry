   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A SUPPLEMENT OF THE TYPES OF CHRIST IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The extract of the whole Bible begins with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As we have seen, the Old Testament refers to Christ mostly with pictures and figures, that is, with types that are mainly of six categories: human beings, animals, plants, minerals, offerings, and foods.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Under the category of human beings, besides the priest, the king, and the prophet, there are the shepherd and the counselor.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Under the category of plants, there are the henna-flower, myrrh, the rose, the lily of the valley, and others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In addition to these six major categories, there are several items in the Old Testament which also typify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One of them is the three universal lights: Christ is the Sun, the moon, and the Star.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Numbers 24:17 says that a Star shall come forth out of Jacob, which Star is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Psalm 89:37 says that Christ as the seed of David shall be established forever like the moon, and Malachi 4:2 says that Christ shall arise as the Sun of righteousness with healing in His wings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, the various dwelling places also typify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First, there is the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the flood came, Noah's household of eight entered into the ark and were delivered from God's judgment upon the ungodly generation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This typifies Christ as our ark; if we believe into Him, we will not perish but will have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Numbers 35 also speaks of the cities of refuge where manslayers who kill without intent may flee from death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This typifies Christ as our cities of refuge.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We are those who sin without intent, but since we are all sinful in Adam, according to the law we should all perish.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, since we have believed into Christ and have fled into the cities of refuge, we are safeguarded from death, and God will not claim the debt of sins from us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ is our refuge.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Not only so, He is the excellent tabernacle and temple with all their furniture: the ark, the golden incense altar, the golden lampstand, the showbread table, and the other items.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All these are extremely precious matters.</S>
