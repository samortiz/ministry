<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. The Northern Boundary</H2><P>The northern boundary (vv. 7-9) was from the Great Sea to Mount Hor, from Mount Hor to the entrance of Hamath, the end being at Zedad, extending to Ziphron, and ending at Hazar-enan.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. The Eastern Boundary</H2><P>The eastern boundary (vv. 10-12) was from Hazar-enan to Shepham, going down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain, reaching to the slope of the Sea of Chinnereth (the Sea of Galilee) on the east, going down to the Jordan (signifying the death of Christ), and ending at the Salt Sea.</P><P>The best part of the good land is surrounded by two seas&#151;the Mediterranean Sea and the Dead Sea&#151;and a river&#151;the Jordan. These two seas and this river all signify the death of Christ. This indicates that the enjoyment of Christ is closely related to His death. Our enjoyment of Christ, therefore, must be in the sphere, the territory, of His death.</P><P>The borders of the good land also indicate that it is an elevated, uplifted land. This signifies the ascended Christ, the heavenly Christ. The Christ whom we enjoy in His riches is a resurrected and ascended Christ. The Christ who was crucified and buried has come into us in resurrection, and now we are in His ascension, enjoying Him as the uplifted land with all its riches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. The Boundaries of the Land<br>to Be Given to the Nine and a Half Tribes</H2><P>"Moses commanded the sons of Israel, saying, This is the land which you shall inherit by lot, which Jehovah has commanded to give to the nine tribes and to the half-tribe; for the tribe of the sons of Reuben by their fathers' houses and the tribe of the sons of Gad by their fathers' houses and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance; the two tribes and the half-tribe have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, toward the sunrise" (vv. 13-15). Verses 1 through 12 describe the boundaries of the land to be given to the nine and a half tribes. The land given to the two and a half tribes, the land which was according to their choice, could be reached without crossing the Jordan. This indicates that it was outside the death of Christ and thus was not actually a part of the good land. Our self-choice is likewise outside the death of Christ and therefore has nothing to do with the real enjoyment of the rich Christ. If we do not pass through the death of Christ, we cannot enter into His resurrection and ascension. This shows us that we should not have our own choice. Whenever we have our choice, we are outside the death of Christ and, as a result, are not in the realm of His resurrection and ascension to enjoy Him as the heavenly, elevated One.</P><P>As indicated by the type of the good land, the Christ assigned to us through God's ordination is a great Christ, a vast Christ. However, the size of the Christ whom we actually experience depends on us. In Himself, Christ is universally vast and does not vary in size, but our experience of this Christ may vary greatly and be different in size. For some, Christ may be only a narrow strip of land; for others, He may be a very large territory. Just as our experience of Christ as the offerings may be in different sizes&#151;a ram, a lamb, or a pigeon&#151;so our experience of Christ as the good land may also vary in size.</P>
