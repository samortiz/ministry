   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is not something that we can do in ourselves.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord can save us, and He wants to apply His salvation to us, but if we do not let Him, He has no way to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, the question for us is whether or not we will let the Lord save us.</S>
