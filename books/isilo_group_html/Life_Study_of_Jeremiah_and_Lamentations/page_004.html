His Book Being a Collection<br>of History, an Autobiography, and His Prophesying</H2><P>Jeremiah's book is a collection of history, of his autobiography, and of his prophesying. He spoke much concerning the history of Israel, he presented a full story of his life, and he uttered many prophecies. Some of Jeremiah's prophecies were negative, and others were positive. Negatively, Jeremiah predicted that Israel would be captured and that the temple would be destroyed. Jeremiah told Zedekiah to welcome the Babylonian army and thereby save the entire city of Jerusalem and the temple; otherwise, the city would be destroyed. However, Zedekiah was stubborn and refused to take Jeremiah's word. When Zedekiah tried to escape, he was captured and brought to Nebuchadnezzar. The king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and then he put out Zedekiah's eyes and bound him in fetters of bronze to bring him to Babylon (39:4-7). Jeremiah witnessed these things.</P><P>The positive side of Jeremiah's prophecy was wonderful. For example, he prophesied that Israel would be restored by God (23:3-8). He also prophesied that God would raise up to David a righteous Shoot who would reign as a King and act prudently and whose name would be called "Jehovah our righteousness" (vv. 5-6). This is a great prophecy concerning Christ, a prophecy not found in any other book. Furthermore, Jeremiah prophesied concerning the new covenant which God would make with Israel (31:33-34). Paul quoted this prophecy and applied it to the covenant in the New Testament (Heb. 8:10-12; 10:16-17). Although this covenant is good for the New Testament believers, the Jews presently have no part in it because of their unbelief and rebellion.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Jeremiah and Lamentations &nbsp; pg 4</div><br></body></html>
