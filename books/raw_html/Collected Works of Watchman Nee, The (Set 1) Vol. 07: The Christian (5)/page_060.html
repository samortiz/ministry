<H1 CLASS=TITLE>QUESTION AND ANSWER BOX</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(8)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 16</H2><P>Whoever has questions concerning biblical and spiritual problems can write to the editor; we shall do our best to answer. Please forgive us for not answering any unprofitable questions.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WOMEN PREACHING</H2><P>Question: I have read the question and answer on women preaching, published in March, the fifth issue of your magazine, concerning whether it is proper for women to preach in the meetings. Mr. Chang from Chefoo answered that the Bible considers that it is improper. I wonder if Mr. Chang can tell me in detail the condition of the church age during the apostle Paul's time. Also, I hope you will spend some time to point out to me if it is proper for women to preach in the meeting. I have heard of many brothers and sisters who love the Lord and who have considered this question important and have thought negatively about what you have published in the paper. Some have said that your paper should not be read. I have always loved your paper, and I hope no one is discouraged because of this. Therefore, please forgive me for asking you boldly and directly this question. (Lee, Chefoo)</P><P>Answer: All the answers in our paper are written by the editor. The name and places in parenthesis following the questions refer only to the name of the one who asked the question and where he is from. Therefore, the answer in the March issue was not given by Mr. Chang, but by the editor. We appreciate your writing this letter to us, and we truly hope the Lord will bless you for your love toward our paper.</P><P>We assume that you have already read the answers to the several questions concerning women in the eleventh issue. For this reason, it is not necessary for us to speak more. However, we would like to take this opportunity to show our readers our attitude toward all biblical questions. Even though we have not received any other letter questioning or criticizing our paper, we think it is a beneficial thing to have. We deeply feel that the interpretation of the Bible is a great responsibility, and for that reason we cannot help but hold a cautious attitude. The matter of women preaching in the meetings is one that is most controversial among many of God's best children. We do not want to present an ambiguous explanation, because we believe there is only one truth. What we believe is the Bible. Besides the Bible, we do not trust in any human traditions, opinions, or explanations. Even if others accuse us of being heretical, evil, or unscriptural, we must still not compromise. We only know what the Bible actually says. It is a pity that many expository writings of the Bible in these days are but changing the Bible! Many explanations result in some part of the Word being lost. We will never say that we can never be wrong! Even if all others approve us, we will be the last to approve ourselves. It may be that our mistakes are more numerous than those of others! But, dear brothers, we are willing to follow the Bible literally. If we are wrong, we are indeed willing to be corrected. We would ask those who know where we are wrong to please point out to us our mistakes from the teachings of the Bible, and not from the opinions of men. We know that we are not trustworthy. This is why we trust in the Bible. Since we know that we are not trustworthy, we would also ask your forgiveness in our unwillingness to trust in any famous Bible expositor. We admit that the exposition in The Christian is quite different from the traditional interpretations of men. We are definitely not for our readers to follow us blindly. If they do this, it would be better for The Christian to cease its publication. We can only proclaim the truth that we know. Our readers should never think that what The Christian has said can never contain any mistake. We have to tell the brothers frankly that we do not believe we are like the biblical prophets who wrote the Scriptures by divine inspiration. We can make mistakes. Even though those who love The Christian are increasing day by day, perhaps no one is more aware of the shortcomings of the magazine than the editor himself. The Lord also knows our shortcomings. We hope that every reader will check our messages against the teachings of the Bible. If they are the same, then please pay the price to follow these teachings. If they are not the same, we advise you to refuse them totally. Never follow blindly just because you trust The Christian and its editor. Our unique goal is to lead people closer to God's living word and His written Word. If a man can be drawn closer to Christ and to the Bible, our work has received its great reward. I wish that The Christian would simply be something like a pontoon bridge, something that is used and then forgotten, with itself receiving no recognition at all.</P><P>Concerning the question of women, we would like to say a few words. The Bible does not say that women should not preach (1 Cor. 11:5). What the Bible forbids is for women to preach in meetings that have brothers in them (1 Cor. 14:34). Some believers have tried to explain this word by making reference to the situation in the church at Corinth during those days. But (1) the book of 1 Corinthians was not written to the church in Corinth only. Please read 1:2, "To the church of God which is in Corinth...with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place." This epistle is shared by all the churches in "every place." (2) Even if this letter is written to the church in Corinth, does it therefore mean that it has nothing to do with those in this age? If this is so, then which book in the Bible is written to us? (3) Even if it is right to say that we should consider the condition at that time, we should still ask: What was the situation at that time? Is it not true that women preached much in the meetings? If this were not the case, there was surely no need for the teaching in this verse. But, wherever there was the case of women preaching in the meeting, this verse forbids it. Therefore, by considering the situation at the time, we can see that women should not preach, for there are only two possibilities: that the situation then corresponds to what is now, or that the situation then does not correspond to what is now. If it does not correspond to what is now, it means that there were no women preaching, and nothing more need to be said. If it does correspond to what is now, it means that there were women preaching, and it means that the apostle's teaching for Corinth was needful for that place. And if it was needful for that place, it means that the women there should not preach. (4) If this word was spoken only because the custom in Corinth was improper, why then did the apostle say such a word also to Timothy? (5) First Corinthians 14 has answered all the questions: "As in all the churches of the saints, the women should be silent in the churches" (vv. 33-34). What is clearer than this? Not only in Corinth, and not only in any locality in China, but "in all the churches of the saints" throughout the world there should not be women preaching. If this was so in the age of the apostle, how much more should it be so today? (Please read the Spiritual Light Magazine, Vol. 37; Miss Ruth Lee's talk on "Studying the Bible.")</P><P>We can consider this question from another angle. In regard to those women who want to preach in the meetings with brothers present, are they doing this based on the teachings in the Bible? If they are, may I ask where is such a verse in the Bible? If there is no such verse, is it not very dangerous to do such a thing? I will ask yet another question: If such an act is not based on the Bible, are these ones looking for scriptural justification only after they have practiced preaching in meetings with brothers present, or after they have made the decision to do so? If this is the case, naturally they would end up "changing" the Bible. Dear brothers, to me, the teachings of the Bible are not hard to understand. The difficulty lies in the fact that men lack the heart spoken of in John 7:17. Those believers who love the Lord should not do anything without the command of the Bible. Moreover, they should not do something first, and then come back to look for Scriptures that would justify them while covering up the Scriptures that would condemn them. We are not saying that women have no gifts, nor are we saying that their work is not effective. We are merely asking what the Bible teaches. I will not talk of others; I will only speak about myself. I came to the Lord through one sister who prayed for me for many years, and I was brought to the Lord through another older sister. The two persons who helped me the most in my spiritual life are Western sisters. But, dear brothers, this is not a matter of personal feelings, but of the teaching of God's Word. Should women then no longer preach in meetings with brothers present? We dare not answer. All those who are personally involved with this problem should search the Bible themselves.</P><P>Dear sisters, I do not want to offend you because of this question. But I can only say what I know (John 3:11). If you are clear that the Lord wants you to do such (that is, to preach in the meetings), then who am I? How would I dare to oppose your words? I wish you all the best of success, and I hope that the Lord will anoint you with the anointing of the Spirit and will bless you. But my warning is that you would not do anything without realizing what you are doing. I am willing to sit on the last row of a meeting and listen to a sister preaching; I am willing to receive her teaching and am willing to pray for her that her work may be effective. I myself only know the outline and the principle of the Bible. As far as how each individual ought to conduct himself, I hope the Lord Himself will grant each one the leading.</P><P>Brothers, if you think that the Bible forbids women to preach in the meeting, and you come across some women preaching, please be careful and do not oppose it right away. With each individual, we should only and always hold the attitude of, "I do not know anything about others." We should follow closely the teaching of Romans 14:4: "Who are you who judge another's household servant? To his own master he stands,...for the Lord is able to make him stand." We should teach others the principle in the Bible, but we should never judge others (if we already know the teaching) concerning their individual practices. I am willing to let sisters preach in the meetings, but I cannot say that I believe women should preach in the meetings.</P><P>Lastly, we often hear people say that the Lord has exceptions. Due to the failure of the men, God raised up Deborah in the nation of Israel. Therefore, in today's church we can also have exceptions such as this. For now, we will not say whether it was right or wrong for Deborah to be a judge. For the sake of simplicity, let us say that it was right. But how many Deborahs are there? It is true that the failure of the brothers today is the saddest story. Perhaps God needs to raise up a new Deborah to do the work. But then, women of Israel, please do not say that every one of you is a Deborah. God may have the authority to do something, but do not take His special way as a teaching. You should all ask yourselves: Has God exercised such an authority? Has He granted me such authority? Does God want me to preach specifically in a meeting with brothers present? If He does, may God bless your work.</P>
