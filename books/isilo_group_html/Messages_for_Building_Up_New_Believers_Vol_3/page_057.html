THE PEACEABLE FRUIT OF RIGHTEOUSNESS<br />
YIELDED THROUGH DISCIPLINE</h2>
<p>Verse 11 says, &ldquo;Now no discipline at the present time seems to be a matter of joy, but of grief; but afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised by it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the apostle draws special attention to the words <em>at the present time</em> and <em>afterward.</em> It is a fact that one does not feel happy at the time of discipline, but grievous. Do not think that suffering is wrong when you experience God&rsquo;s discipline. Discipline is surely a suffering. The Bible does not say that the cross is a joy. It says rather that the cross is affliction. The cross brings us suffering. The Lord despised the <em>shame</em> for the <em>joy</em> set before Him. This is a fact. The Bible does not say that the cross is a joy; the cross is not a joy. It is always a suffering. It is not wrong to grieve and feel afflicted when we are disciplined.</p>
<p>But we must learn obedience. Only through obedience can we partake of God&rsquo;s holiness. Discipline indeed is not a matter of joy &ldquo;at the present time.&rdquo; Instead, it is grief to us. This is not surprising; it is in fact quite normal for us to feel this way. Our Lord did not consider the trials a matter of joy when He passed through them. Of course, we can make it a matter of joy. Peter said that we can exult in various trials (1 Pet. 1:6). On the one hand, they are a suffering. On the other hand, we can reckon them to be a joy. How we feel is one thing, and how we reckon is another thing. We can feel grieved, but at the same time, we can reckon it to be a joy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Yielding the Peaceable Fruit</h2>
<p>A child of God should fix his eyes not on the present but on the future. Pay attention to this sentence: &ldquo;Now no discipline at the present time seems to be a matter of joy, but of grief; but afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised by it.&rdquo; Do not look at the suffering you are going through now. Instead, look at the resulting peaceable fruit of righteousness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Moab Being at Ease from His Youth and Settling on His Lees</h2>
<p>Jeremiah 48:11 says, &ldquo;Moab has been at ease from his youth; / And he is settled on his lees / And has not been emptied from vessel to vessel; / Nor has he gone into exile. Therefore his taste remains in him, / And his scent is not changed.&rdquo; Are you clear what this is saying?</p>
<p>This is the problem with many who have not passed through trials. The passage describes those who have never suffered any chastisement or sufferings before the Lord. The Moabites had been at ease from their youth. They experienced no suffering or pain. What did such ease produce? They became like wine settled on its lees. If a person brews liquor from grapes or other kinds of fruit, the wine surfaces to the top, while the lees settle to the bottom. The wine floats, while the lees sink. In order to clear the wine, it has to be poured from vessel to vessel. If the lees remain at the bottom, sooner or later they will spoil the taste of the liquor. In making wine, a man must first allow the grapes to ferment. After the grapes ferment, he transfers the wine from one vessel to another. If he is not careful, he will pour the lees out as well. This is why he has to pour carefully. But one pouring is not enough; some lees are bound to escape into the other vessel. This is why he has to do this again. A second time may still not clear the lees, and he has to pour the wine into a third vessel. He has to keep pouring until no lees are left in the wine. God said that Moab had been at ease from his youth and had settled on his lees. He had not been emptied from vessel to vessel, and his lees always followed him. One must be emptied from vessel to vessel if he wants to do away with the lees. He has to be poured out again and again until one day the lees at the bottom are gone. Moab was full of lees; although he was clear at the top, he was not emptied at the bottom. Those who have never gone through trials and chastisement have never been emptied from vessel to vessel.</p>
<p>Often it seems as if God is digging a person from his roots. A brother may experience God&rsquo;s uprooting through his consecration; everything that he owns may be completely uprooted. A brother may experience God&rsquo;s uprooting through his sufferings and trials; he may be stripped of everything he has. This is to be emptied from vessel to vessel. God&rsquo;s hand will crush us thoroughly. He does this in order to clear away our lees!</p>
<p>To be at ease is not a good thing. Brothers and sisters, God wants to purify us. This is why He disciplines and scourges us. Never consider ease and comfort to be something good. Moab&rsquo;s ease caused him to remain Moab forever!</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_056.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_058.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages for Building Up New Believers, Vol. 3 &nbsp; pg 57</div><br></body></html>
