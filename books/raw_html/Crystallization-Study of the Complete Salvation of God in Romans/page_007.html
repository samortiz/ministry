<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Through the Believers' Faith</H2><P>God's righteousness is Christ, and the believers' faith (1:17b; 10:8) is also Christ (Gal. 2:20b), whom they appreciate and receive in their hearing of the gospel. The more we hear the gospel concerning Christ, the more we appreciate Him and the more we receive Him. The more we say, "O Lord Jesus, I love You. I appreciate You," the more He enters into us to be our faith. Faith has an object, and it issues from its object. The object is Jesus, who is God incarnate. When man hears Him, knows Him, appreciates Him, and treasures Him, He causes faith to be generated in man, enabling man to believe in Him. Thus, He becomes the faith in man by which man believes in Him. Hence, this faith becomes the faith in Him, and it is also the faith that belongs to Him. We have no righteousness or faith in ourselves. The righteousness of God is Christ, and the faith in us is also Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE CONTENT OF ROMANS</H2><P>God's judicial redemption is covered by the first four chapters of the book of Romans, and God's organic salvation is covered by the last twelve chapters, from chapter five to sixteen. This organic salvation equals reigning in life by the abundance of God's grace and by the abundance of God's gift of righteousness.</P><P>Romans 5:10 points out that God's full salvation revealed in this book consists of two sections: one section is the redemption accomplished for us by Christ's death, and the other section is the saving afforded us by Christ's life. The first four chapters of this book discourse comprehensively regarding the redemption accomplished by Christ's death, whereas the last twelve chapters speak in detail concerning the salvation afforded by Christ's life. Before 5:11, Paul shows us that we are saved because we have been redeemed, justified, and reconciled to God. However, we have not yet been saved to the extent of being sanctified, transformed, and conformed to the image of God's Son. Redemption, justification, and reconciliation, which are accomplished outside of us by the death of Christ, redeem us objectively. Objective redemption redeems us positionally from condemnation and eternal punishment; subjective salvation saves us dispositionally from our old man, our self, and our natural life.</P>
