   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S ORDERING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this world, in addition to man's will, two other wills are entirely opposite to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God not only wants us to obey Him; He also wants us to withstand Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, God puts these two matters together two times in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>James 4:7a says, "Be subject therefore to God," and 4:7b says, "Withstand the devil."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First Peter 5:6-9 says, "Therefore be humbled under the mighty hand of God...Your adversary, the devil...Him withstand, being firm in your faith."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is balance in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A believer should submit himself to God in everything he encounters.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He should confess that God's ordering for him is the best.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Though he suffers, he willingly obeys because this is the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is what we have spoken of in chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is half of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The apostles knew that we are in danger of being biased, so they immediately said that we have to withstand the devil after we submit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The reason for this is that in addition to God's will, there is also the devil's will.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many times he counterfeits God's will, particularly in our circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we are misled to think that there is only God's will in this world, we will be deceived by the devil and take his will as God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, God wants us to obey Him and, at the same time, withstand the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To withstand is a work of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To withstand is for the will to oppose, to be unwilling, to decline, and to disagree.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God wants us to use our will.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is why He says, "Withstand."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God will not withstand on our behalf; we ourselves have to withstand.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We still have a will, and we still should use our will to obey God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the teaching of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the believer misunderstands and supposes that God's will is manifested in His arrangement of the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To him, everything that comes upon him is fully God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Consequently, there is no need for his will to have any further selection, consideration, determination, resistance, or anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He merely accepts everything in silence.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This sounds good and right.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But unavoidably, there can be misunderstanding.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is true that we acknowledge God's hand behind everything.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We also know that we should fully submit under God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But this is more a matter of attitude than a matter of conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If whatever befalls us is God's commanded will, do we have anything to say?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is a matter of attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we become willing to obey God, we can further examine and ask: Are these matters from evil spirits?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Or are they permitted by God?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If they are ordained by God, we have nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But if they are not, we should work with God to withstand them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should not submit to every circumstance without daily examining and testing it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our attitude should be the same all the time, but our practice should be carried out only after we understand the circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Otherwise, we may be obeying the devil's will.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Believers should not be people without a mind.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They should not be entirely passive and controlled by the circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Rather, whenever they encounter anything, they should always vigorously, actively, and consciously examine its source, test its nature, understand its content, and then decide on a course of action.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Being submissive to God is important, but this does not mean blind submission.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A vigorous investigation does not mean that we can disobey God in our circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Rather, it means that we have the intention to submit to God, but we want to know if it is God that we are submitting to.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today few believers are submissive in their attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This means that even if they know something is of God, few will submit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Yet when they have been broken by God, they still do not discern if a matter is from God; as long as something comes to them, they accept it without any question.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The balanced truth is to be submissive in attitude yet, at the same time, to accept something only after one is clear about its source.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many fully consecrated believers do not understand this difference.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They just passively submit to the circumstance, assuming that everything is God's arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This gives evil spirits the opportunity to utilize and afflict them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Evil spirits prepare the circumstances as traps in order to cause the believers to accomplish their will.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They may stir up storms and may cause the believers to be afflicted by them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In this way, they make believers suffer the sin of others, while considering this to be an example of not resisting "him who is evil" Matt 5:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Little do they realize that God also wants them to be "struggling against sin" Heb 12:4 , to overcome the spirit of this age through overcoming the circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The results of such a practice are: 1 they no longer use their will to choose and decide; 2 God will not pressure them through their environment; and 3 evil spirits will utilize the circumstance to take over their passive will.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then the believers will be submitting to evil spirits and think that they are submitting to God.</S>
