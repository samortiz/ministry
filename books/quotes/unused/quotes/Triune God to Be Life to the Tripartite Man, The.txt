You must then use the openers to dig into the depths of the holy Word in order to obtain the riches concerning life
In the New Testament the Triune God became incarnated for the purpose of imparting Himself as life into His believers
These different kinds of life are in three main categories: the plant life , the aquatic life , and the animal life
In Genesis 1, three main categories of life are unveiled, and in Genesis 2:8-9 the tree of life, signifying the divine life, is revealed
In the first two chapters of Genesis, four kinds of life are mentioned: the plant life, the animal life, the human life, and the divine life
A peach tree and an apple tree are similar in kind to one another, but a banana tree is different in kind from a peach or apple tree
Although the plant life is food for the animal life, the plant life itself is mainly for beauty and decoration
The plants are beautiful, the animals are full of activity, and man is full of wisdom to administer everything
Satan's tempting of man to take the tree of knowledge indicates that Satan wants to keep man away from taking God as his life
After this mingling is accomplished, we express the food we have taken in, through our person, our image, our attributes
The mingling of God with us does not annul our being; therefore, we will be able to identify one another, even in eternity
God is gracious to make eating an enjoyment to us, because if it were not an enjoyment, many of us would not eat
Once we learn how to use a computer in school, we do not need to go back to school to learn the same thing again
Because of this corrupting element, God is prohibited by His glory , holiness , and righteousness from contacting fallen man
When the requirement of God's glory, holiness, and righteousness is fulfilled, His glory, holiness, and righteousness are satisfied
Having been redeemed back to his original state before the fall, man can once again exercise his right to contact God
The tree of life, signifying God as life, was temporarily kept away from fallen man until Christ came to accomplish redemption
Since the tree of life signifies God Himself, by eating the tree of life, man would have received God Himself as life
Under this propitiation, God was legally free to contact man, and man was repositioned to enjoy the right to take God as life
Through these verses we can realize that the Old Testament saints entered into God through the type of propitiation
These verses mention four main points concerning our enjoyment of God as life fatness a river of pleasures the fountain of life and light
There is the marine life in the ocean, the birds in the air, and the cattle, beasts, and creeping things on the earth
The first thought in the Bible concerning God's being life to us is God's creating of living things on the earth
God's action in creating man in His own image indicates that God wants man to have Himself as man's life so that man can express Him
All the other different kinds of trees, such as the apple tree, the peach tree, and the banana tree, are easily understood by everyone
On a radio program some years ago in Los Angeles, a famous preacher and Bible teacher was asked what the tree of life is
If we put Genesis 2, John 15, and Revelation 22 together, we can see that God is the tree of life and that the tree of life is a vine
Satan's tempting of man to take the tree of knowledge indicates that Satan wants to keep man from taking God as his life
In Revelation 19 the Lord is the One who judges in righteousness with the sharp sword that proceeds out of His mouth
The propitiation in the Old Testament gave the saints the right to partake of God as the fountain of life for their satisfaction
The propitiation in the Old Testament pointed to the redemption of Christ, which He accomplished in the New Testament
Joining these verses with verse 14, we can see that God as the Word became flesh to bring grace and reality to us
In order to carry out human things, we need human reality, and in order to have human reality, we must have human life
John 1 is a marvelous chapter because in it God as the Word coming in incarnation is combined with grace and reality to be our life
All these verses indicate that God's incarnation was to bring Himself into us, that is, to dispense Himself into us, as our life
The life that He came to give us is the divine life , and the life that He laid down for us is His human life, His soulish life
Through death and resurrection He released His divine life that He might dispense the divine life into His believers
The divine life has been released for us to receive, and the way to receive it is just to believe into Christ as the resurrected One
Christ died for us in the form of the serpent, typified by the brass serpent that Moses lifted up in the wilderness
Christ was judged for us that we as His believers may have God's eternal life the uncreated, indestructible life
Christ came through incarnation, and His death and resurrection were a continuation of His journey in incarnation
We needed redemption because we could not meet the threefold requirement of God's glory, holiness, and righteousness
God's creating of man in His image indicates that God wants man to have God as his life so that man can express God
God's putting man before the tree of life indicates that God desires that man would take Him, signified by the tree of life, as man's life
Satan's tempting of man to take the tree of knowledge indicates that Satan wants to keep man from taking God as his life
These six items are the main points in the Old Testament concerning the matter of the divine life in its relationship to us
He laid down His own human life for man and took it again to release His divine life that He may dispense it into His believers
Christ, like the brass serpent, had only the form of the serpent, because He did not have the poison of sin within Him
Christ's coming in the form of the serpent was to deal with our serpentine nature in order to impart Himself as life to us
In the fifth step of His coming, Christ, as the last Adam, became the life-giving, life-dispensing Spirit through His resurrection
He laid down His life in His human nature, dying in the form of a serpent in order to deal with our serpentine nature
He accomplished redemption, which solved the problems of Satan, the world, the sinful nature, the self, the old man, sin, and sins
The highways in the United States were built by straightening curves, leveling hills, and bridging gaps and rivers
The flowing of the water out of Him indicates the release of His divine life through His death and resurrection
The process of Christ's becoming the life-giving Spirit may be likened to the process whereby a melon becomes juice
Christ was 'cut into slices' on the cross and 'pressed' through death and resurrection until He became 'juice'
The Triune God enters into the believers as the Spirit because the Spirit today is the consummation of the Triune God
Regeneration means that a life has come into us to germinate, to generate, in order to change our being and to give us a new start
Peter 1:23 says that we were 'regenerated, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the living and abiding word of God'
The center and reality of Peter's message was the resurrected Christ in all of His steps from incarnation to becoming the life-giving Spirit
It seems that there are two ways to be regenerated: through the resurrection of Christ and through the living word
We were regenerated by God through the resurrection of Christ; but how do we know the fact of Christ's resurrection?
If every day we partake of beef, eventually, not only our skin but also our clothing will begin to smell like a cow
To be glorified, we must be involved with the element of God's glory, with the element of God's glorifying nature
We may think that the process we undergo after our initial regeneration should be called sanctification or transformation
After God's coming, God enters into us to regenerate us, to make us His children, His sons, that we may be partakers of the divine nature
Our daily life should not merely be a human life that we live out by ourselves; our daily life should be Christ
Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all'
If Christ were our daily life and our church life, there would be no problem in our family life and church life
The problems in our family life and church life come because we live as Chinese, as New Zealanders, or as Americans
Christ is life to us in one way in the church age, and He will be life to us in another way in the kingdom age
Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God and as life to His believers will become the enlarged kingdom of God in the coming age
In the present age, Christ is our life ; in the coming kingdom age, the millennium, Christ as life to us will be the kingdom
In the coming age, Christ will become the enlarged kingdom of God, typified by the stone cut out without human hands
Today in the church age Christ is a small stone but in the kingdom age this stone will become a great mountain that fills the whole earth
We may wonder whether the Lord is in the heavens waiting for the time of His coming, or is growing within us to be manifested
We as believers have received the little Jesus, but we will inherit the enlargement of Jesus, which is the kingdom
To have eternal life is a matter in the present age; thus, in John 3:16 the Lord Jesus used the present tense of the verb have
In Matthew 19:29, the Lord used the future tense of inherit, because the inheriting of eternal life is something for the coming age
Eternal life certainly is ours today, but we cannot yet say that we have inherited eternal life as our legal possession
The overcoming believers will enjoy Christ as the tree of life in the paradise of God, which is the New Jerusalem in the millennium
To have eternal life is one thing, to inherit eternal life is another thing, and to enter into eternal life is yet another thing
The goats will be sent into the eternal punishment of the lake of fire , but the sheep will enter into eternal life
We all must exercise our faith to believe that we can be the overcoming believers to be the kings in the coming kingdom
Since we are members of the Body of Christ today, we will also be a part of the enlargement of Christ in the coming kingdom
Our being a part of Christ, a part of the new man, and a part of the kingdom today is completely based on our having the eternal life
The eternal life in the present age, in the coming age, and in the eternal age is related to the Triune God becoming our life
When the Lord Jesus returns, the church age will close, and thousands of Jews, including the entire nation of Israel, will be saved
According to Hebrews 11:40, the saints of the Old Testament are not complete without us; therefore, they must wait until we are ready
When we are ready, the wedding feast will begin , and the entire one thousand years of the millennium will be a wedding day feast
After this wedding day, the marriage life will begin in the new heaven and new earth for eternity in the New Jerusalem
We as kings will eat the fruit of the tree of life, and the people, the nations, will eat the leaves of the tree of life
In the present age, the Triune God is life to us in the way of His living within us to make us the members of the new man
These messages are an extract of the entire New Testament revelation and economy of God, from the incarnation to the New Jerusalem
The process of the Triune God is clearly revealed in the New Testament, but this matter has been missed by most Christians
Theophilus of Antioch , one of the early church fathers, was the first to use the word Trinity in his writings
The word person is often used to describe the Three of the divine Trinity, yet we must be careful in using such a term
The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not three separate persons or three Gods; they are one God, one reality, one person
Many of the divine titles in the Bible, such as 'God the Father,' 'the Lord Jesus,' and 'the Lord Spirit' , are compound titles
He lived and walked on this earth, passing through the long 'tunnel' of human living for thirty-three and a half years
Through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, God was processed and consummated
Many of the Jews at that time, like many Jewish scholars today, could not believe that the little babe in the manger was Jehovah God
In addition, the Lord's all-inclusive death accomplished one positive thing: it released the divine life from within His humanity
In resurrection, He brought humanity into divinity, making the believers of Christ sons of God and members of Christ
When we live in resurrection, we bring ourselves into God, and when we do not live in resurrection, we are outside of God
The ingredients of creation, incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension have been compounded together in this one Spirit
Many of the students of Confucius are very humble and meek, but their humility and meekness are a matter of outward character
In actual fact, we have such a mingling, but in our daily life we may not experience this mingling in a practical way
When we sense that the mingling has ceased, we must confess to the Lord and receive the cleansing of the blood
Life does have a number of attributes and humility is one of these attributes however the humility of life is not something of human conduct
In Proverbs 20:27, the word for spirit is the Hebrew word neshamah, the same word used in Genesis 2:7 for breath
In this message we will see the matter of the Triune God being life to the tripartite man as shown in the book of Romans
We have seen how the tripartite man has been created with a spirit to be the receiver and container of the divine life
The first point of our more detailed study is the Triune God being life to us as revealed in the book of Romans
The righteousness of God is unveiled out of faith to faith in order that the righteous or just can have life and live by faith
In order to restore peace within his empire, Constantine realized that he must first unite all the different Christian parties
Even today, the Roman Catholic Church, as well as many of the Protestant denominations, recite the Nicene Creed each Sunday
The creed itself does not contain anything wrong, but the omission of the seven Spirits and of the life-giving Spirit is its shortage
During the Dark Ages, when the Roman Catholic Church became very prevailing, there was little progression in the study of theology
After the initial advance made by the mystics such as Madame Guyon and Father Fenelon, mysticism was further developed by William Law
In the eighteenth century, Count Zinzendorf and other brothers in Moravia began to experience something of the church life
Brother Nee was saved in 1920, and in 1922 the Lord's recovery in China began when a church meeting was established in his hometown

The department stores, the advertisements in the newspapers, and the places of entertainment promote the modern fashion of the world
To be saved in the divine life from the bondage, the slavery, of sin, the law of sin is by the release of the law of the consummated Spirit
To be saved in the divine life from the present age of the world is by the sanctification of the consummated Spirit
To be saved in the divine life from our body of humiliation is by the transfiguration in the virtue of the divine life
Different sciences discover the principles which govern the existence and activities of different things in the universe
To set our mind on our spirit is the first step of our cooperation with the law of the consummated Spirit, which is in us to save us
The more you read Romans 8, the more you can realize that the law of the Spirit of life is the Triune God Himself
When we have a more thorough knowledge of ourselves and the Lord's way of saving us, we cannot boldly say that we are saved in everything
Justification, sanctification in life, transformation, and conformation are subjects which are unique to Paul's Epistles
It is very useful in studying Romans to collect all of these particular terms, subjects, and phrases and to study them
The release from the bondage, the slavery, of sin, the law of sin, is the goal of the law of the consummated Spirit
We also need to be saved in the divine life of Christ by the sanctification of the consummated Spirit from the present age of the world
Through the steps of incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection, the Triune God was processed and consummated
We need to be sanctified by the consummated Spirit, not by our strong will or mind, from the present age of this world
When many of the sisters read the newspaper, they may immediately try to find information about the sales in the department stores
We may think that we are holy, but we must ask whether or not the way we comb our hair or the way we dress ourselves is modern
A hungry little child must cooperate with its mother at feeding time by opening up its mouth to receive the food
We are saved in the divine life of Christ from our natural being by the transformation of the life-giving Spirit
The issue of our being saved in the divine life of Christ is transfiguration, in the virtue of the divine life, from our body of humiliation
With the resurrected Christ, there was the expression of the divine splendor, the expression of the divine life
When we are saved in the divine life by being released sanctified transformed conformed and transfigured we can reign in the divine life
The more we live and are saved in the divine life, the more kingship we exercise and the more we reign in the divine life
The overcomers will be co-kings with Christ in the millennium because they will be saturated and swallowed up by the divine life
Because they are full of life, they become the embodiment of life, and they will also have the kingship in full
The matter of reigning in the divine life is referred to by John and is also one of the particular items stressed in Paul's writings
In order to build up the Body, we must overcome sin, the world, Satan, our natural man, the self, and individualism by the divine life
We have such a life in which we enjoy the peace of God which is God Himself and the grace of the Lord which is the Lord Himself
These three factors may be very common in our understanding, but we need to have a deeper realization concerning each of them
Anything that is apart from Christ regardless of how good or scriptural it may be is not the real experience of the divine life
In Matthew 24:30, the Lord Jesus said that He would come back as the Son of Man on the clouds of heaven with power and glory
In heaven Jesus sitting, Christ the Lord is there enthroned; As the man by God exalted, With God's glory He is crowned
Christ as the divine embodiment, who is divine and human, all-inclusive, all-extensive, and unlimited, is our God-allotted portion
Attributes are the things which belong to us as our possession virtues are the things we possess that are expressed for others appreciation
According to 1 Peter 29 we are a royal priesthood to tell out the virtues of Him who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light
Christ is rich and His riches are unsearchable and untraceable , indicating that He Himself is unsearchable and untraceable
As the Spirit, Christ is one with our spirit to mingle Himself with us that we may be one with Him, even one with the Triune God
Christ is the Head and the Body , and He is all the members of the new man and in all the members of the new man
The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God , the Spirit of Jesus , the Spirit of Christ , and the Spirit of Jesus Christ
Such a Spirit is the allinclusive indwelling lifegiving inscribing freeing strengthening and leading Spirit to us with us and in us
The Holy Spirit is the Spirit mingled with our spirit as one spirit , making us one with the processed Triune God
The Spirit is the seven Spirits the sevenfold intensified Spirit to meet the need of all the degraded churches in their seven stages
The churches in Revelation 2 and 3 not only represent seven actual churches but also represent the progress of the church in seven stages
Christ is the object of our experience of the divine life, and the Spirit is the reality of the experience of the divine life
Philippians 3:10 says, 'To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death'
The killing elements in antibiotics are like the element of the death of Christ being compounded in the Spirit
Tis not hard to die with Christ When His risen life we know; 'Tis not hard to share His suff'rings When our hearts with joy o'erflow
As we abide in this anointing, we must learn also not to reject the killing which is exercised on us in this anointing
In the Old Testament, His chosen people were Israel, but in the New Testament, His chosen people are the believers
As believers, we were chosen to be holy that we may have His nature, and we were predestinated to be His sons that we may have His life
According to chapter one, the name given by God was Jesus, but those who experienced Him called His name Immanuel
When Peter and the other disciples heard the Lord's word in Matthew 18:20 and 28:20, they may have wondered how the Lord would be with them
They may have thought that the Lord would be with them in the same way that He was with them before His death and resurrection
They may have considered that the Lord would continue to be with them physically, and this may have made them quite happy
In John 14 the Lord Jesus said, 'I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever'
For this reason, the Lord prepared His disciples by telling them that He would ask the Father to give them another Comforter
In Acts and the Epistles, the Spirit of reality is the very presence of the consummated Triune God in our spirit
The Triune God passed through the processes of incarnation and resurrection in order to dispense Himself into us
Through incarnation He could be Immanuel outside of His believers, but this would fulfill only part of His intention in being with us
His being with us outwardly does not fulfill His purpose to dispense Himself into our being, so He had to go through another process
Today Immanuel is the very life-giving Spirit, who is the consummated Triune God as His presence with us moment by moment
We do and say things one way when we are alone, but when we have someone else with us, we do and say things differently
God created man in His image and after His likeness with the intention that one day He Himself would become a man
At the time of the Lord's birth, men did not understand its significance; but the angels understood and celebrated
The consummation of the process was when this wonderful person, the God-man, walked out of death and entered into the realm of resurrection
Two thousand years ago God became incarnated, and then through death and resurrection, He became the life- giving Spirit
It is good to be nice and humble; but these things alone do not accomplish the purpose of taking care of his family
We must walk in order to fulfill God's purpose in accomplishing His economy in the building up of the church as the Body of Christ
The purpose of college is to perfect people in a profession so that they can fulfill their purpose in human life
Each of us must grow into Christ and function in His Body in each one's measure for the direct building up of the Body of Christ
The old creation came out of the creating hand of God, but the new creation has God's essence and element within it
In order to complete the work of the new creation, God had to act in His divine trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
In that conference, it was decided that the Son, the Second of the Godhead, should be the centrality and universality of the new creation
The first step of this process was the Son as the embodiment of the Divine Trinity becoming a man through incarnation
Approximately two thousand years ago four thousand years after His creation of man God branched out from and with His divinity into humanity
After branching Himself into humanity through incarnation, God did many things, but His main achievement was the cross
The old creation terminated by the cross of Christ included sin Satan the world the old man I the self the flesh and the natural life
In John 4:24 the Spirit is the essence, but in the divine title the Father, the Son, and the Spirit the Spirit is the person
Corinthians 3:17 also says that the Lord is the Spirit, and in verse 18 the compound title Lord Spirit is used
The life-giving Spirit came into existence through Christ as the God-man passing through the cross and entering into resurrection
Between the God-man and the life-giving Spirit is the cross, the greatest matter in the accomplishment of God's eternal purpose
He is the centrality and universality of Gods economy and the cross is the centrality and universality of the way to accomplish Gods economy
Through Christ's resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit, we, the chosen ones of God, were germinated to be the new creation
The life-giving Spirit in the resurrection of Christ was the germination of the new creation achieved by the resurrection of Christ
After going through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit
In Exodus 30 the anointing oil was a compound of five elements: myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, cassia, and olive oil
Eventually, Christ as the last Adam, the God-man, became the life-giving Spirit with all the elements of His divinity and humanity
Christ as the God-man, the achievement of His cross, and Christ as the life-giving Spirit are three bequests in the New Testament
In Him we have divinity, the proper humanity, the cross accomplished by His all-inclusive death, and resurrection
He terminated us with the whole old creation for the purpose of germinating us with Himself as the life-giving Spirit in resurrection
Our crucifixion with Christ was accomplished once and for all at the cross, but the experience of His cross is lifelong
When we experience the cross terminating us in a daily way, we are eventually led to live not an exchanged life but a grafted life
We must always realize that we have been crucified, and that we should no longer live by ourselves but by Christ who lives within us
In God's New Testament economy, Christ accomplished three new things which remain as landmarks in the universe
These landmarks in the accomplishment of God's New Testament economy are incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection
Incarnation took place two thousand years ago, but according to God's reckoning of time, it was only two days ago
Today we are in the age of incarnation, and we are enjoying Immanuel as the result, the consummation, of incarnation
Crucifixion was a heathen practice adopted by the Roman Empire for the execution of slaves and heinous criminals only
Many prophets and righteous men, including Abraham, desired to see and understand the things of this age and did not perceive them
In our experience, we must learn to enjoy Christ as Immanuel through the life-giving Spirit, and we must also learn to apply the cross
Years ago, many crucial, deeper spiritual truths were brought to China through some of the European missionaries, such as Sister M
Galatians 5:24 says, 'But they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts'
Two thousand years ago, before we were born, we were crucified on a mount called Golgotha outside of Jerusalem
If a brother says something that glorifies you or that offends you, immediately you will have a reaction or response
A word which glorifies you may cause you to glorify yourself, or a word which offends you may cause you to be angry or unhappy
The proper experience of the cross would cause you to have no response when you hear something good or bad about you
To put to death the practices of the body is not only to put to death the bad things, but also the good things
The real significance of bearing the cross is contained in Galatians 5:24, Romans 8:13b, and 2 Corinthians 4:10
Our common experience is to react when we are wronged by others, especially when others make mistakes at our expense
The room in which we stayed did not have a bathroom, so we had to bring water into the room from outside in order to wash ourselves
Your unwillingness to be wronged or defrauded in small things is an indication that you are unwilling to bear the cross
Today we should experience Him as Immanuel through the life-giving Spirit by putting everything concerning us to death
Having seen this vision of the experience of the cross, we can realize that the church life among us is still very short
He Himself as Immanuel and as the life-giving Spirit will be experienced by us as the reality of the cross and resurrection
The cross, which is the death of Christ, is the centrality and universality of the way for us to live the Christian life
Morning to evening, all day long, day after day, throughout our Christian life, we live to die and we die to live
Whenever we have a problem with other brothers or sisters, we must realize at that moment that we are crucified with Christ
When we have the realization that we have been crucified, the outcome is that we live by Him, in Him, and with Him
As we die in the death of Christ, we enter into resurrection once again that we may live by Him, in Him, and with Him
God's economy according to the divine revelation in the holy Word is to get the new creation out of the old creation
The way God gains the new creation is to first put the old creation to death, that is, to terminate the old creation
Without the injection of the divine element into God's creation, God has no way to get the new creation out of the old creation
On one side of the cross, we were the old creation, but on the other side of the cross, we are the new creation
On the other side of the cross, the divine element has come in to enliven the old creation, making it the new creation
The old creation does not have the divine life and nature, but the new creation, the believers born again of God, does
On the earth today, it is difficult to find a man who considers that he should live a life for the carrying out of God's purpose and economy
Such talks are merely religious and have nothing to do with what kind of person we should be for the accomplishment of God's purpose
Satan deceived Eve , and through partaking of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, Adam and Eve were deadened
For this reason the Lord said in Matthew 16 If anyone desires to come after Me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me
The first two lines of a hymn translated by Brother Nee express this same thought To the foe my word is always No To the Father it is Yes
The cross is the centrality and universality of our way to live the Christian life in order to fulfill God's purpose
God Himself is the substance, Christ is the embodiment of this substance, and the Spirit is the realization of this substance
When the consummated Spirit is breathed into you, He is the reality of dying to self, and He is also the reality of living to God
If we do the right thing, but our spirit is wrong, our conduct will neither edify the saints nor build up the church
To be poor in spirit means that you are humble, acknowledging that you have nothing, know nothing, can do nothing, and are nothing
To be poor in spirit is not only to be humble but also to be emptied in your spirit, in the depth of your being
To be pure in heart is a matter of motive it is to be single in purpose to have the single goal of accomplishing Gods will for Gods glory
As a believer we should always have a willing spirit for the things of the Lord and for the things of the church
If you are a person who has the Spirit of God, you will be wise, full of understanding, and full of instruction
We need to have a willing spirit and be filled with the Spirit of God in order to practice the God-ordained way to meet and to serve
The first three years, from 1984 to 1987, were years of investigating because we were not that clear concerning the practice of the new way
In the group meetings, the Body of Christ is built up directly by all the perfected members, not just by the gifted persons
We must speak for God to our fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins, in-laws, neighbors, classmates, and colleagues
Gradually, as you take care of two or three of these believers, one will be raised up and brought into the church life
Some would take the excuse that they are busy with the business affairs of the church and do not have time to care for people
The new way, the God-ordained way, has been welcomed by most of the saints since 1988, but there are not many who really practice it
We do not have the intention of gossiping, but when our conversation continues for a long time, we may be tempted to gossip
The three of the Divine Trinity from eternity past have been and still are coexisting and coinhering with one another
The child born, who is also the son given, is called the Wonderful Counselor, the Mighty God, the Eternal Father, and the Prince of Peace
Although we cannot fully understand these portions of the Word, we have to accept the clear word of the Scriptures
The Father is distinct from the Son, the Son is distinct from the Spirit, and the Spirit is distinct from the Father and the Son
The son given was called the Eternal Father, and after His death and resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit
In church history certain terms were invented in order to describe the relationship between the three of the Divine Trinity
A hin of olive oil, which was the base of the ointment, was compounded together with the spices of myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia
The oil typifies the Holy Spirit, and the four spices typify Christ's humanity and divinity with His death and resurrection
Today the Spirit of Christ is the bountiful supply of the divine-human person of Christ, the cross of Christ, and the resurrection of Christ
The consummated Spirit as the compound Spirit compounded with Christ's person and death is the reality of the death of Christ
The consummated Spirit as the compound Spirit compounded with Christ's person and resurrection is the reality of the resurrection of Christ
The Spirit is the reality of God, the reality of Christ, the reality of Christ's death, and the reality of Christ's resurrection
Of these many capacities, the fellowship of life, the light of life, and the sense of life are very particular and basic
Fellowship comes with the divine life because fellowship is one of the capacities in the nature of the divine life
From the time that we believed into the Lord Jesus and were regenerated, the divine life entered into our being
Two very important phrases in these verses are 'estranged from the life of God' and 'having ceased from feeling'
Thirty percent of our character is what we have received by birth, and seventy percent of our character is by habit
They found that one of the brother's socks was in a cup on a piece of furniture and that the other sock was on top of his pillow
For a woman to wear men's clothing and for a man to put on women's dressing are an abomination in the eyes of the Lord
You must learn how to live in the divine life in the fellowship of life, in the light of life, and in the sense of life
The fellowship of the divine life revealed in the New Testament is abstract, mysterious, and very difficult to define
The Greek word rendered fellowship in 1 John 1:3 is koinonia, which means joint participation or common participation
Electricity is manifested in light bulbs or fluorescent lamps when the current of electricity flows through them
In a community or city, all of the homes are joined together by the current of electricity which flows into each of the homes
The fellowship is the flow of the eternal life within all the believers who have received and possess the divine life
John 1:2-3 and 6-7 reveal that the fellowship of the divine life has both a vertical aspect and a horizontal aspect
The apostles then reported to sinners the eternal life in order that they might have fellowship with the apostles
Verse 6 says, 'If we say that we have fellowship with Him and walk in the darkness, we lie and are not practicing the truth'
Both aspects of the divine fellowship are closely related; therefore, it is difficult to say which aspect comes first
If you do not have the proper fellowship with the Lord, it is difficult to have fellowship with your fellow believers
In the same way, if you do not have the proper fellowship with your fellow believers, it is difficult to have fellowship with the Lord
Positionally, we all are in this fellowship, but in our daily living, very few of us are in the reality of fellowship
When we are not in this fellowship in a practical way, we are out of the Spirit, out of the Triune God, and out of the divine life
It is difficult to find one person who believed in the Lord directly by himself without the help of someone who preached the gospel to him
If we do not have a proper relationship with those around us, it is difficult to have a good fellowship with the Lord vertically
Most of us may think that we daily start this fellowship according to its vertical aspect, followed by its horizontal aspect
Since most of us have spouses, other family members, or roommates living with us, our fellowship usually begins in a horizontal manner
We must maintain both the vertical and horizontal aspects of the fellowship in order to be healthy spiritually
In our experience we often cannot have vertical fellowship with the Lord without first having horizontal fellowship with other believers
A saint who has a proper living and who is victorious is one who is always in the divine fellowship vertically and horizontally all day long
The brothers and sisters should have thorough fellowship with one another, even concerning practical things related to their daily living
We may feel that we should only fellowship with those around us about the messages we have read or some other spiritual activity
In Revelation 22:20 the Lord Jesus said, 'I come quickly,' but it has been nearly two thousand years, and the Lord is still not back
The Roman Catholic Church controlled people by its organization but those who broke away from Catholicism brought in division after division
By being restricted in this fellowship, the Body of Christ is kept in oneness, and the work of the ministry continues to go on

The divine fellowship has two aspects: the vertical aspect between God and us and the horizontal aspect among the believers
Mostly, people preach the gospel by telling people that when they are saved, they will go to heaven after they die
The believers will go to the pleasant section of Hades called paradise, and the unbelievers will go to the unpleasant section of Hades
The thought that the saints go to heaven after death is part of the leaven added to the three measures of meal by the woman in Matthew 13:33
By resurrection and in resurrection the spirit, soul, and body of each of the dead believers will no longer be separated
His body is probably buried somewhere around Rome, the place of his martyrdom, but his spirit and soul are in paradise
Through his physical death, he would be in paradise with Christ to a fuller extent than he enjoyed in this earthly life
If we exercise our spirit, we will never talk in a worldly manner or speak negatively about the saints or the churches
If there are problems in a certain church we may have a desire to merely talk about the situation but our spirit within will urge us to pray
The two aspects of the divine fellowship require us to be in the two spirits, the Holy Spirit and the human spirit
When we exercise our spirit to carry out the divine fellowship we are fully sanctified rescued and saved from everything other than Christ
To be victorious, overcoming, sanctified, and transformed, we must exercise our spirit to carry out the two aspects of the divine fellowship
If you have a good time with the Lord in vertical fellowship you will be eager to see the other saints in order to have fellowship with them
Once you have fellowship with the saints through prayer, you are brought into vertical fellowship with the Lord again

We should be vertically fellowshipping with the Lord and, at the same time, be horizontally fellowshipping with one another

In this message we want to see how the cross is related to the divine fellowship, the fellowship of the two spirits
Just as the Spirit is the consummation of the Divine Trinity, fellowship is the consummation of love and grace
In the Divine Trinity, the Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the application of what the Triune God is to us
If we have the Spirit, we have the Son and the Father because the Father is embodied in the Son, and the Son is realized as the Spirit
The divine Spirit regenerated our human spirit with the divine life , and now our human spirit is mingled with the divine Spirit
In the whole universe, there is only one thing which takes away all the obstacles between us and God the cross
In the previous message, we pointed out that hymn 737 speaks of the divine fellowship and its relationship with the Spirit and the cross
Consummately, our cleansing is by the divine fellowship of the Spirit based upon the cleansing blood of Christ
The Greek word for fellowship, koinonia, means joint participation, and this joint participation issues in oneness
Our fellowship is not thorough and obstacles remain within us because we do not have the cross in our experience
In Matthew 16:24 the Lord said, 'If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me'
Generally speaking, the Chinese educate their daughters to be somewhat quiet and hidden, and this has molded many of the young sisters
A person who does not expect anyone to regard him, to respect him, or to give him sympathy cannot be easily offended
If we expect the Lord to use us more, we have to learn to speak for the Lord in the meeting with a proper tone, a proper sound
To bear the cross is to deny the self, to put the self to death, to apply the cross of Christ to the self all the time
