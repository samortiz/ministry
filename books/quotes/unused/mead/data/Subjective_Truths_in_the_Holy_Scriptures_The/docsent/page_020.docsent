   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DRINKING ONE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What should one do after baptism?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Corinthians 12:13 says, "For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body and were all given to drink one Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this verse there are two important words, baptized and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To be baptized means that you enter into the water, and to drink means that you let the water get into you.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After this glorious baptism there must be the drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You need to drink often.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Drinking follows baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Once you are baptized, you must drink.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Baptism puts you in a position where you have the qualification, the standing, and the authority to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The water for baptism is the water for drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is the same water.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This life-giving Spirit is the Spirit for baptism and the Spirit for drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After baptism you need to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How do we drink?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First Corinthians 12:3 tells us: "No one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In other words, whoever can say, "Jesus is Lord!" is in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, each time you say, "O Lord," you are in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Each time you say, "O Lord Jesus," you are taking a drink of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sister M. E. Barber wrote a hymn, Hymns, #73.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The second stanza in this hymn says: "Blessed Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Mighty Savior!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>/ In Thy Name is all I need; / Just to breathe the Name of Jesus, / Is to drink of Life indeed."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is evidence that this sister truly had the experience of drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need only to breathe the name of Jesus, that is, to call on the Lord Jesus, "Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Lord Jesus!"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then we will drink of His life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This calling does not need to be very loud.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In order not to disturb others, we may at times call softly, "O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>O Lord Jesus!"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In any event we must drink.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we call softly, "O Lord Jesus!" we are firstly quenched within, then we also are enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After a few more minutes of calling, the inner light will become brighter, and we will end up dealing with our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is truly marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must drink in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Finally, I would like to mention Romans 8, 9, and 10.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Apparently these three chapters are not connected, but actually they are completely related.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Chapter eight speaks of the living water being in us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verses 9 and 10 show us that the Spirit of God dwells in us; that is the Spirit of Christ in us, and that is also Christ in us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This refers to the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Chapter nine says that we who drink of this living water are vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For example, water is poured into a cup, so the cup is a vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are vessels to be filled with the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How do we get filled?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Romans 10:12 says that the Lord is "rich to all who call upon Him."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do you, as a vessel, want to enjoy the riches of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is only one way, and that is to call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is good to listen to messages because they can be helpful to you.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, you must call on the Lord's name yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Once you call, His riches will become your drink, your supply.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then as a vessel you will be filled with the riches of the Lord of all.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is in this way that we can have the subjective experience of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This God has gone through a process to become water that is drinkable, and He is right here.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We only need to call on His name, and He as the Spirit will enter into us so that we can enjoy His riches.</S>
