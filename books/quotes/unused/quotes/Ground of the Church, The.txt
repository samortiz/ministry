What are the actual grounds upon which so many of these so-called churches have laid Christ as their foundation?
You see, all the 'churches' claim the same foundation, which is Christ; but they all stand upon different grounds
When Paul went to Corinth to preach the gospel and do the work of the Lord, did he establish a Pauline church with Christ as its foundation?
Did Apollos, who also ministered in Corinth, establish a church upon the ground of Apollos with Christ as its foundation?
Any sectarian ground is not justified by the Word of God and is against the basic principle of the Body of Christ
No matter where we are, we have to gather together on the one unique ground of the church in order to keep the unity of the Body of Christ
The Scriptures clearly show us that in every locality the expression of the Body of Christ, that is, the local church, should be just one
If you are living in Los Angeles, you must be built up together with other believers in Los Angeles as the church in that locality
The one that was built up in Jerusalem was called the church in Jerusalem , and the one in Antioch was called the church in Antioch
We can testify that we have seen this ground of unity taken and the church life practiced upon it in many places, and we are seeing it today
From our observation and our own experience we can boldly declare that it really works and it is the most blessed way
We must come out of the divisions, not to form another division, but to come back to the proper ground, the ground of unity
Why not simply come together with the believers in the locality where we live to be an expression of that church?
More than thirty-five years ago in Shanghai, a brother with a Bible in his hand was taking the street car to go to a meeting
Oh, let us all come together on the unique ground of unity to have a proper expression of this one church in the place where we live
