   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Now the believer has to choose whether he will remain passive, allowing evil spirits to continually move him.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If he is unwilling to let evil spirits use him in this way, even though he is temporarily unable to "determine" anything, he will not allow evil spirits to use his power of determination.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>So the battle for freedom begins.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This fight is altogether a contest of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because the will has fallen into passivity, it allows every faculty of the whole being to fall into passivity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The will the person has lost its sovereignty and no longer can freely control and direct every faculty of the entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As a result, evil spirits come in to substitute for the will the person and to control and direct every faculty of the entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, if the believer wants to be free, the will needs to rise up to: 1 oppose the rule of evil spirits, 2 recover the lost ground, and 3 work actively together with God and exercise his own entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Everything is dependent on the will.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the will opposes the evil spirits and does not allow them to occupy its faculties, they will withdraw.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As we have mentioned before, evil spirits are able to come in because the believer gave them permission.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, his present rejection is needed to cancel out his previous consent so that the evil spirits will lose their ground of attack.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When he very carefully withstands them, evil spirits cannot possibly work anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every inch of ground must be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every point of deception must be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The believer should have the patience to fight with the enemy in everything and fight to the end. He should know that rejecting all the ground does not mean that he has already recovered all the ground, because not all the ground is recovered immediately after he has rejected them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Evil spirits will still make their final struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The will of the believer still needs to pass through very fierce warfare before it can become strong, powerful, and free.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, the believer must continually carry on to overthrow the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, he needs to overthrow with endurance, until every point of ground is exposed, rejected, and abolished, until all the faculties of his whole being can turn according to the human will.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All the passive faculties should be recovered to their normal working condition.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The mind needs to think clearly; it needs to be able to think about the subjects that the will wants to think about.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Moreover, no thought should be outside the will's control.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The memory needs to be able to memorize the things that a person wants to remember and not be filled with thoughts that he does not want.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Other actions of the body singing, speaking, reading, and praying also need to be controlled by the will.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The will needs to be active so that it can be the master of the whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All the various abilities of man's whole being need to function normally.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A believer should not only refuse the ground taken by evil spirits, he also should refuse all the work done by evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A believer needs to exercise his will to take the stand of opposing all the work of evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This will inflict suffering upon evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then the believer needs to ask God to give him light so that he will know the works of the evil spirits and refuse them one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The works of evil spirits on the believer include: 1 replacing the believer's activities and 2 influencing the believer's activities.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, the believer ought to reject their work by not allowing 1 his activities to be replaced or 2 his activities to be influenced.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The believer should refuse not only the ground that gives rise to evil spirits but also the ground that preserves them in their present position.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When a believer withstands in this way, he will see them use all of their means to oppose him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Unless he engages them in combat with all his might, he cannot return to his normal condition and regain his freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When a believer battles this way, he will discover that initially he cannot use his own faculties.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But when he marshalls all his strength to attack their full power, his will can fully bounce back from passivity to activity, and he can once again rule over his whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Both passivity and demon-possession are destroyed in the warfare.</S>
