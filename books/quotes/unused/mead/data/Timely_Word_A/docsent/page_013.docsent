   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BURDEN TO STAY IN ONE PLACE TO DIRECTLY HELP BUILD UP A LOCAL CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I have a burden to stay in one place for at least nine months out of the year in order to directly help build up the local church there with some elders.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1922 Brother Nee raised up a local church in his city.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Sixty-six years have passed and we have not seen a model of a local church built up entirely according to what we have seen from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Brother Nee did not have the time to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Until now I have not had the time to do this either.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After leaving mainland China, I was in Taiwan for about ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But I spent most of my time to train the saints, and I spent more than one-third of my time in other countries.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We trained many new believers who were saved through our preaching of the gospel when we came to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many brothers who were saved through our preaching became elders.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We trained them and built them up.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then many of them became useful ones to bear responsibility in the church or in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some brothers who are now elders in Taiwan are the sons of these useful ones that were raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because I was so busy training the saints, I did not have the opportunity to build up a local church according to what I teach and according to what I have seen of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many brothers came to me asking for certain ways to do things, but I did not give them a way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I told them to bring this matter to the Lord in prayer and seek the Lord's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I did this because I learned a lot in my earlier ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In my earlier ministry, I could give people many instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eventually, I discovered that very few of these instructions worked well.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We can illustrate this by the teaching of driving a car.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A driving teacher can impart the principles of driving to his students and even some details, but his teaching is not the application.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the driving teacher actually drives the car, his driving may be absolutely different from what he taught.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He only taught some principles with some details.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But quite often these principles do not fit in with the real situation of the road.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When he taught driving, he did not realize there would be a big dip on a certain road.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He did not anticipate that the roads would be flooded due to heavy rains.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He never dreamed that two cars would crash right in front of his car.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some of the brothers may say, "I drive according to Brother Lee's teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Brother Lee told me this."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But Brother Lee never spoke about "two cars crashing in front of you."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>My point is this if the steering wheel of the church were in my hand, I might drive it absolutely different from what I taught you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This driving would be according to the present situation and condition of the church in order to bring the church safely to its destination.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus far, according to my observation, many of the leading ones are still building up the local churches in a "probing way."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They heard something and they received some teaching, but in their practice they are not so clear what to do or how to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is why I have the burden to be involved in the direct building of a local church in a certain place if the Lord would give me time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I must be before the Lord as to whether or not I should do this and where I should do this.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Please pray for me concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE EXPERIMENT IN TAIPEI</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>About four years ago, in October of 1984, I went to Taipei to have some new things tested out as an experiment for our practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Before I went, I told some of the brothers that I was going to Taipei to try to do something new.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I also said that in those three to five years, I would not be able to do much to help the churches in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What I would do was to come back two times a year for the trainings on the Life-study of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then what I would do in Taipei would be tested out, and I would have a finished model to bring back to the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The churches in the United States would be able to follow this model and do something according to it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When I went to Taipei, I told the brothers there that I came back to have a new start and that I would call this a new way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But I did not have the assurance how much this way would succeed or work out.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I told them that what I was going to do would be a trial, a test, an experiment.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At that time close to eighty new elders were established.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I told these elders that their being appointed as elders was not something permanent.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Their appointment was also subject to experiment.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Maybe after a short time, some would find out that they were not suitable persons for the eldership and they would feel to resign.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Or maybe I would find out that some were not so fitting in this responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I repeated this word again and again we are conducting an experiment.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I said that the training center in Taipei was a lab, that is, a laboratory.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Regretfully, I was not strict in keeping my word to raise up a model in Taipei and then return to the United States with the finished product.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When the saints in the United States heard about this, many of them wanted to go there to attend the training.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I hesitated but I gave in to their request.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Now I regret this.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At that time, I should have kept my principle strictly to say "no" to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I should have asked all the saints to please stay in the United States while I tested and experimented various things.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then I could have properly found out whether or not those things worked.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I should have kept this principle, but I did not.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>That was my negligence, and I feel regretful for this.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Many saints from the United States went to the training in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In principle the training should have fit the situation of the saints who came from the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But I did not have the time to oversee the training that much.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I was occupied to the uttermost with the work on the Chinese Recovery Version.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I could not even be involved that much with the training.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If I had had the time, I would have considered the particular need of the saints from the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The training was planned and formed just to fit in with the need of the island of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It was not designed to meet the need of saints coming from other countries.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>My negligence was in accepting these saints to be trained and not doing anything to prepare the training to fit in with their situation.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Within such a short time of training, we baptized over thirty thousand new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If I were able to repeat that time of training again, I would not let the trainees baptize so many.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We discovered that we could baptize many people, but then we realized that we did not have the manpower to take care of the new ones.</S>
