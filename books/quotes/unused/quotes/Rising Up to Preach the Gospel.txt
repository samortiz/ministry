When we sing freely, our spirit is released and our heart is opened; then spontaneously we will preach the gospel to others
If we seriously look into this, we will see that those who have been able to bear fruit for the gospel have all been thick-skinned
Sometimes he screamed at people and scolded them, and occasionally he even made strange noises in his speaking
These are the three points related to the gospel-to be thick-skinned, to have an open mouth, and to have a released spirit
Some brothers are so 'unmanly' in their preaching of the gospel that they appear to be more female than the females
My intention is not to encourage you to speak inaccurate doctrines but to show you that you need to exercise your spirit
The Chinese are naturally conservative and well-behaved, so when they meet together, everyone is reserved and proper
It is right to take care of others' feelings, but as Christians we should daily pray and be beside ourselves before God
It means that you are full of praises, thanksgivings, psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, and you are full of the power of the Holy Spirit
Sometimes when we are sitting in the meetings, we look around at the brothers and the sisters and we feel embarrassed to do anything
Even before the birth of the Lord Jesus, the world situation was working in different ways to coordinate with the gospel
When the Lord Jesus was about to be born the political situation in that area was stable under the rule of the Roman tetrarchs and governors
When these two were married, however, both were poor, so they lived in Nazareth, a despised city in Galilee, which was a despised region
Considering their financial condition, they would not have traveled this far to Bethlehem only to give birth to the Lord Jesus
If the Lord Jesus were to be born in Nazareth, however, the Old Testament prophecy could not have been fulfilled
He would 'crucify' the lamb with its front legs fastened to the horizontal piece of wood and its hind legs to the vertical piece
According to the type in the Old Testament, the Lord Jesus, who died as the Lamb of God for our redemption, also had to be crucified
Although in the Old Testament the children of Israel might hang an executed criminal on a tree , that could not be considered crucifixion
At the time the Lord Jesus was arrested and convicted by the Jews according to the law in the Old Testament He could only be stoned to death
The Lord's birth was a fulfillment of the prophecy in the Old Testament, and His death was a fulfillment of the type in the Old Testament
Due to its strong political and military power, Rome was able to maintain a situation which was peaceful, stable, and safe
The people and nations within the territories of the Roman Empire, though very complicated, were all under one rule
No matter where the citizens went, they could travel freely throughout the empire without having to apply for passes
After the unification of the Roman Empire, the government also picked up the usage of Greek and promoted the Greek culture as well
If we study the book of Acts and observe world history, we can realize that the world situation always goes along with the gospel
Whenever the gospel was about to reach a certain place, a certain change or action, such as a migration, would occur there
In Jerusalem at the beginning, three thousand people were saved at once, and then at another time, five thousand
In the old days, especially with the inconvenience of transportation, who would be willing to migrate to a faraway place?
With many people saved in Jerusalem and concentrated there, naturally there was no way for the gospel to spread
The Lord had to raise up a persecution so that the believers living in Jerusalem were scattered to other localities
When we come to chapter twenty-one of Acts, we see that there was a great number of Christians gathering again at Jerusalem
Because of the changes in the environment, people began to open themselves to changes and would no longer hold on to the old things
We could not forget that there were four to five hundred million people waiting for us to preach the gospel for their salvation
The check for sixteen hundred American dollars is for your round-trip tickets by boat and your living expenses in America
Every country would be given a quota of 20,000, but the total number of immigrants could not exceed 300,000 yearly
Also, in principle, once the number of the Chinese increases in the meetings, more typical Americans are reluctant to come
In this way, we were not keen in our perception, and after six or seven years we lost from five hundred to one thousand saints
To summarize the different situations mentioned above, we cannot carry out the Chinese-speaking work in the same way we did two years ago
Every year forty thousand Chinese have been coming to the United States, and most of them are not proficient in the English language
They may be able to do grocery shopping, make phone calls, and greet people, but they will not be able to prophesy or pray in the meetings
Today the church here cannot be a typical American church it has to be a local church a church that includes all the saints in that locality
Since there are many Chinese among the saints, the church will naturally have to make arrangements to include them
In chapter six it says that as the disciples were multiplying in number, the problem of language began to appear
The Hellenists murmured against the Hebrews because their widows were being overlooked in the daily dispensing
One time, over a hundred of them came to a gospel meeting of the church, and nearly all of them received the Lord
They came to America to study when they were young, and after they graduated, they stayed to work, spreading in all classes of society
If we are thick-skinned, open our mouth, and release our spirit, the gospel will enter into people, and they will be saved
Some of them do not intend to stay permanently, and their heart is still soft, so it is still easy to preach the gospel to them
Eventually, because the Lord stirred up the environment, we all have come one by one, and more and more are still coming
We need to have people, especially young people, who receive this burden and are led by the Lord to serve full-time
Acts chapters twenty-seven and twenty-eight tell us the story of Paul's being delivered as a prisoner on a ship sailing to Rome
Because the saints were willing to give themselves to the Lord, they were blessed by the Lord even in material things
While he was held as a prisoner on a ship, the Lord sent an angel to him, who said, 'You must stand before Caesar
That we are saved is not a problem, but we still need to live an overcoming life that we may have trophies to offer to the Lord
Paul said that the believers whom he led to salvation were his hope, joy, and crown of boasting before the Lord
If when you meet the Lord you see that everyone else is bringing a herd of lambs and you alone are emptyhanded you will feel sad and ashamed
According to this hymn, while we believers are alive, it is day, and when we die, we enter into the dark night, that is, the night of death
While it is still day, before the night falls, we should work actively to save many souls that we may bring with us to offer to the Lord
Otherwise, if we did not lead one person to salvation in our lifetime, we will be full of shame on that day and not have a good feeling
When the Lord returned, this slave thought he had done a good job because he did not lose the talent but had kept it intact
If we are not faithful now, when He comes back, He will not let us get away with it; rather, He will rebuke us as being 'evil and slothful'
The third slave was evil because he had the talent but did not go to work with it, trade with it, or even earn interest with it
It seems that He admitted that He is such a Lord who requires His slaves to reap where He did not sow and to gather where He did not winnow
One time when we preached the gospel at Chiao Tung University in Shanghai, seven hundred students and professors attended the meeting
We cannot say to the Lord, 'You did not sow, and You did not winnow, so it is unreasonable for You to ask us to reap and gather'
In America, according to my observation, the atmosphere in the Chinese society and its constituents has completely changed
To travel from Shanghai to the west coast of America takes only twelve hours; you can make the round trip in one day
Because of this, the frequency of travel among human communities has greatly increased, and the sphere of travel has also been broadened
Facing the international state of affairs, the United States has become lenient concerning the quota of applicants for permanent residence
Amazingly, among the saints in the Lord's recovery, those from Taiwan comprise the greatest number, which is almost fifty thousand
Under these circumstances, when they meet some fellow Chinese who preach the gospel to them, they spontaneously receive it
We have to see it as a big matter that needs to be carried out through the authority of the heavens and the earth
If there were no operation of the authority of the heavens and the earth, who would listen and believe when we preach the gospel?
In six thousand years of human history no philosophy doctrine theory or any other religion has been so prevailing as the Christian gospel
Many of us can testify that we are not foolish, yet we all heard and believed the gospel and are preaching and speaking Jesus every day
Stanza 4 reads Burn burn O love within my heart Burn fiercely night and day Till all the dross of earthly loves Is burned and burned away
The more we believe, the more we feel sweet, and the sweetness becomes so great that we even become 'crazy' for Him
Only those slaves who are evil and slothful do not see this and say that He wants them to reap where He did not sow
Many Chinese in America are especially interested in two kinds of business-the restaurant business and the 'church' business
Do not think that the only goal of your coming to America is to make a living, and that you have to struggle very hard to achieve this goal
You are working so that you can have food to eat, and you have been eating for so many years, yet it is still the same food
Since you are going to attend the elderly saints' prayer meeting, it is right to ask your children or grandchildren to serve you
Even if you gain the whole of America but do not gain one soul for the Lord, you will have lived and worked your whole life in vain
The afternoon after the Lord's Day meeting an announcement was made that there would be a meeting on the next day
Later on, those who had received the laying on of hands testified that the words of blessing were exactly fitting for each of them
On another Lord's Day, after the preaching of the gospel in the morning, there was an edification meeting in the afternoon
Their boat tickets were bought with the money offered to the church; we also provided each one with three months of living expenses
Due to the breaking out of the Pacific War, all the Caucasians, including the missionaries, had been imprisoned
Their zeal for the gospel and their one accord truly touched the local Christians, who subsequently came and joined them
They could not understand what had happened that such a small civic organization had such a great mobilizing power
Now it simply depends on whether or not we will cooperate with the Lord as His good slaves to open our homes to reap and to gather His crops
The book of Acts shows us that once a church was established, the saints began to preach the gospel and to meet from house to house
When the faucet is turned on, more water will come; if you do not let the water go out, no more water will come
Simply open your doors to invite three or five, or eight or ten, of your neighbors to come for a meal, tea, or a brief conversation
Since you are also Chinese, if you go and pay them a visit to sit in their homes and to warm their hearts, they will be touched
We are not leading others to go downhill; rather, we are leading them to go upward-to fear God, to worship God, and to believe in the Lord
We simply need to open the door of our houses to welcome people and sit down with them to talk, sing hymns, and preach the gospel
Paul also said that it would be woe to him if he did not preach the gospel, but if he preached the gospel, he would be rewarded
God not only has given us a commission to preach His gospel; He has also given us power to accomplish the commission He has given us
If we do not read carefully, we will not see that within this charge there is a support, which is the power of the Lord
In Acts 1 the Lord said that in His ascension He would fulfill what the Father had promised by pouring down the Spirit of power
, Peter and the eleven disciples stood up and said that they were not drunk but that they had the Spirit who was poured upon them
Two centuries ago, the truth concerning the outpouring of the Holy Spirit was neglected by organized, formal Christianity in its degradation
Nonetheless, in church history there have always been believers who experienced the power of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit
It was in such a situation of dryness and deadness that God raised up the so-called inner-life people, the mystics
They devoted themselves exclusively to studying the Scriptures, neither following the Catholic dogma nor caring for established practices
Consequently, because they were oppressed by the Catholic Church and rejected by the other established churches, they fled to Moravia
These believers were determined to recover the testimony of the church that their families of old had previously had in Bohemia
They began to have disagreements among themselves and were constantly engaged in debates concerning doctrines and practices
A good number of the Moravian Brethren also moved there, and they greatly affected the spiritual condition of the Puritans in America
He rejected all the things of the Catholic Church and renounced the practices of the state Church of England as well
They heard John Wesley's preaching and could not help shedding tears, producing two white lines on their black faces
Some people could not tolerate this, so an 'Amen Corner' was reserved in the Wesleyan chapels for the 'Amen shouters'
Because of John Wesleys great evangelistic power the storm was calmed down and the effect of the French Revolution on England was annulled
We saw that some of them were jumping, some were shouting, some were yelling, some were laughing, and some were rolling
Simply speaking, the Holy Spirit is the third of the Divine Trinity and the ultimate expression of the Triune God
The Lord's speaking in Luke 24:49 indicates that the Son would pour out the Holy Spirit as the promise of the Father
When we read the Bible, we often accept everything as a matter of course and therefore do not study to find the reasons behind it
According to the utterance, it seems there are three: the Father who promised, the Son who poured out, and the Spirit who descended
They are not merely three but triune: the One who promised was the One who poured out, and the One who poured out was the One who descended
It was not until two thousand years ago when He became flesh that the Triune God began to go through various processes
He first entered into the womb of the virgin Mary where He was conceived, and then He was born as 'the holy thing'
The foolish Jews thought that God was in the temple, so they went there to worship and serve God by burning incense and offering sacrifices
At the age of thirty, as the Lord Jesus began to minister, the Spirit of God descended upon Him to be His power economically
The Bible tells us that in His resurrection, the last Adam, the lowly carpenter, became the life-giving Spirit
When the Lord breathed into the disciples, He was actually breathing Himself as the Spirit of reality into them
Afterward, He spent forty days to train the disciples to live by this wonderful and mysterious One and to practice His invisible presence
According to the Lord's word, the disciples waited and prayed for ten days, after which the Holy Spirit was poured out upon them
He has divinity with humanity, and He has passed through death and resurrection, entered into ascension, and descended
According to the truth, on the night of the Lord's resurrection the Spirit of life was breathed into the believers as breath
It is at this point that Peter spoke with reference to Joel that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved
God had to pass through the necessary processes in order to pour Himself down so that when men call on the Lord's name, they can be saved
The Spirit we have received today is a great wind, a great cloud, and a great fire, and within there is also the electrum
Whenever wind and clouds are stirred up in the world's political situation, war breaks out and fire begins to burn
In 1950 the church in Hong Kong was considering to buy a piece of land in Tsim Sha Tsui to build a meeting hall
The brothers lost faith when they heard this, because the total cost of the land was approximately fifty thousand U
Children who are foolish and lazy do not eat good food when it is available and do not put on good shoes when they have them
We may not understand technology, astronomy, or geography, but we know the gospel and are clear about the biblical truths
Dear saints the power of the gospel is in these three things God Himself as the consummated Spirit our prayer and our preaching of His word
When we pray to Him and wait on Him, the wind will start to blow, the cloud with the fire will come, and the electrum will be produced
Among these three, Orange County is the highest newly developed area, and the church in Anaheim is located in the center of Orange County
He changed the world situation and rearranged everything not for America and not for China but for His own gospel
In Acts 28 when he and his companions came to the Market of Appius and Three Inns, the brothers in Rome came to meet them
We should cooperate by consecrating our homes and our time so that our homes can each become the Market of Appius and Three Inns
Fifty years ago there was a saying in Chinese that if a person becomes a preacher, he will live a simple life in poverty
Lord, we pray that You would open the door of the gospel so that those whom we have contacted can come to believe in You and to receive You
If we do not have God as our golden base, our Christian life is a mess, and we are not able to be built up as part of God's building
The first stanza says that the Holy Spirit as a storm wind blows not from the four corners of the earth but from heaven, that is, from God
From the time the conflict starts, the fire comes forth, spreading intensely to every corner to consume all the things that displease God
The fire burns away all defilements and all common things, thereby purifying us so that we may be exactly like God, holy and without blemish
Stanza 4 says that the glowing electrum is manifested and shines into our heart that we may partake of God's nature
The Gospel of Luke shows us that the Lord Jesus was a man in whose human virtues the divine attributes were expressed
To many in the Pentecostal movement the power of the gospel is related mostly to speaking in tongues divine healing and casting out demons
As for God's word, in Acts 6:4 Peter said, 'But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word'
Much of Christianity believes that the Father is on the throne, the Son is sitting at His right hand, and only the Holy Spirit comes to us
Even though doctrinally it seems this way, actually in our experience the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the one Spirit
You may often think of yourself as very clever and rational, but once the fire starts to burn, you will be fervent and become 'crazy'
Maybe you do not sin, but since you live in a world that is filled with evil and filth, you cannot help but be defiled
Regardless of how often you have washed your hands, when you wipe them with a handkerchief, the handkerchief is dirty
It burned to a point that the outsiders said to one another, 'You had better not go to the upper floor where they meet
Rather, we should pray that the Spirit would burn within us, causing us to deal with all of our sins that He may move and operate within us
The Bible says that no word from God shall be void of power , and those who hear the word of the Lord will live
Reading books on philosophy can never cause us to be crazy; but as soon as we read God's word, we will become crazy from within
In Acts 2 Peter said that when the Holy Spirit is outpoured, everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved
We also should pray like this, not paying any attention to regulations but rather calling on the name of the Lord unceasingly
Young people who are on the campuses, if you are burned like this every morning, you will burn others when you are at school
If your home is not given for the Lord's use, and you preach the gospel only individually, then there will be a mouthpiece but no outlet
In Greek, the word announce is the verb form of the word gospel, meaning that they announced the gospel of Jesus as the Christ
If we announce the gospel of Jesus as the Christ from house to house, then all our houses will be speaking Christ
What we have are 'sinner-friends,' such as drinking friends, gambling friends, dancing friends, playing friends, and deceiving friends
We did not have good friends before we were saved, but after we got saved, the Lord Jesus became our good Friend
We should hold receptions at our homes for the Lord Jesus and invite our sinner-friends that they may receive the Lord Jesus as their Friend
The Bible not only has examples of sinners preaching the gospel; it also has examples of 'good men' preaching the gospel
When Peter came, he was surprised because Cornelius was already waiting there, having called together his 'relatives and intimate friends'
We also need to open our house and hold a reception for Jesus, inviting all our relatives and intimate friends
We could go anywhere in those regions to work for the Lord, so why should we go to a foreign country and stay in a foreign land?
There are hardly any rejections; many have come to attend the Lord's banquet, and nearly all of them have received the Lord
Alternately, if you can get your parents' permission, you can invite classmates over for meals and to hear the gospel
In this way, the blessing will come not only to us but also to our sons and daughters for generation after generation
We did this to find the proper way that is according to the Lord's leading in the present age with regard to the meetings and service
In the summer of 1964, a brother who was a worker in the Southern Baptist denomination showed us their statistics
The next night we distributed the cards to the brothers and sisters so that they could right away go door-knocking and visiting
We studied this segment of our history, and after making comparisons we felt that we needed to restore a proper action
We thank and praise the Lord that up to the first half of this year, our experiment has proved to be correct and totally practical
In order to go out visiting people by door-knocking, you need to be equipped with these fundamental requirements
In the spring of this year, there were over one hundred college graduates who joined the Full-time Training in Taipei
If this is the way you look, when you stand there giving a message or sit there to preach the gospel to others, who will listen to you?
After being examined by them for a few minutes, you will be too embarrassed to speak, and you will lose your standing
For us to propagate and for the number of people to increase, we need to be thoroughly changed and equipped anew
Of all, every time before we go out, we must have adequate and thorough prayer until we are filled with the Holy Spirit
Even though we prayed yesterday, we have to pray again for our going out today and come before the Lord for His shining
If you are serious in this matter, you will realize that it is not enough to spend merely three to five minutes to pray
It is an unalterable law that to pray until we are filled with the Holy Spirit requires us to be enlightened and to confess our sins
As this sense becomes clearer and clearer and the Lord's shining becomes brighter and brighter, we will see our mistakes
After confessing this to the Lord, He may say, 'Now that you have confessed your sin to Me, you need to go to your wife to apologize'
Amazingly, if you do go and apologize and come again before the Lord, you will immediately be filled with the Holy Spirit
In other words we need to let the Lord first save us to the uttermost until we are freed then when we go out doorknocking we can save others
To pray to confess our sins to deal with our sins and subsequently to be filled with the Holy Spirit will result in boldness and confidence
If you go out door-knocking but have not prayed, your legs will be shaking, and you will not have power in your speaking
If you have not been filled with the Holy Spirit, you might not be able to speak even a word out of your mouth
If you say he will be saved, he will be saved; if you say he will not be saved and that he needs to wait awhile, then he will not be saved
When you speak, you should learn to be concise instead of being wordy and to be affectionate instead of being cold
Even if you have learned all the truths, a person whom you visit by knocking on his door will not be able to discern that
It does not matter who the person is or how high his speaking skill is, no one can speak as neatly and concisely as a book
One co-worker told me, 'I found out that while door-knocking, especially on the college campuses, it is useless to speak our own words
If he would not grasp the opportunity but would continue to talk the opportunity may slip away and he would not be able to close the deal
Such a consideration means that it is not the new one who is not willing to pray, but it is you who are not willing to pray
It is not that he is not willing to lose his face, but it is you who are not willing to lose your face in leading the prayer
On the other hand while you are doorknocking you must learn the technique of grasping the opportunity to lead a person to believe and pray
Immediately after he prays, you should show him Romans 10:13, which says, 'For 'whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved'
Baptism by immersion is to put the entire person into the water, whereas baptism by sprinkling is merely to drop some water on the person
As long as there is the opportunity for baptism, the sisters can go fill the tub with water while others are praying
Maybe we cannot go out to knock on doors every day, but one thing we can do is spend two to three hours each week for door-knocking
The result of our study and experiment this year in Taipei has proven that the new way surely is the God-ordained way
We discovered that many high-rise and apartment managers are brothers who have not been meeting with us regularly
When we enter into a high-rise building or an apartment, we have to go through the manager to get his permission
Even though we have used computers to study the statistics, we still cannot determine exactly how many there have been
Many among them were not meeting with us for a long time, but they were discovered again through the house-to-house visitation
Because of their desire for the truth, they were attracted by our practice of the new way, and they turned to the Lord's recovery
According to the result of the study, we were able to draw a conclusion: The new way is surely the best way ordained by God
If you walk according to the spirit, you will realize that in your door-knocking you will often meet someone who is very pursuing
At this time, you may ask him to read a section of the footnotes in the Recovery Version or give him some literature
Recently, some serving ones from the ministry office went out for fellowship and were resting in the mountains
While they were singing hymns and praying, an old retired woman who lived across the street heard them and came over to see them
The sisters read to her a portion of the footnote concerning the five women in Jesus Christ's genealogy in Matthew 1
The next day after they ate breakfast, right before they were about to leave she said, 'I am the owner of this house
Perhaps you have just been newly saved, or perhaps you have been saved for a long while but have never been taught in this way
The Christians are the most blessed people because they have received the redemption of the Lord Jesus by faith to enjoy His salvation
Christians are happiest when they preach the gospel to lead people to salvation, which even causes society to be blessed
There are schools and communities everywhere in America, so there is a greater need of full-timers to go out and work for the Lord
If indeed there will be two thousand five hundred full-timers in Taiwan, the churches' expenditures will be huge
If you save up money for the purpose of the gospel, those people who are saved by it will welcome you in eternity
If we all have such a heart, the Lord's move will be blessed, our number will increase, and the spread will accelerate!
In this message we will continue to fellowship more thoroughly on the matter of baptism as this is related to our past exercise and practice
If you say that his faith is superficial and not thorough enough, then what kind of faith is sufficiently thorough?
To be sure, the people came again and answered correctly, and right after they passed the test, they were baptized
The mistake we make in our practice today is that we neglect people after we baptize them, just as someone may neglect a child after birth
Though he was born weak, he is healthy and strong today because he was properly cared for and nourished to grow up into such a big boy
It may be that he became clear about salvation only after a certain time, but his need of becoming clear is merely your own criterion
When a person hears the gospel, repents, confesses, prays, calls on the Lord, and receives the Lord, this is the beginning of his salvation
Now we have seen that what is more dependable is not the gaining of an individual but the gaining of his household
After much research at this time, our conclusion is that the unit of gaining people is not the individual but the household
And send for Simon, who is surnamed Peter, who will speak words to you by which you shall be saved, you and all your house'
When we knock on doors, we are knocking not only on the doors of men's hearts but also on the doors of households
It does not matter whether he is just trying to be polite; as long as he says, 'Come again when you have time,' that is good enough
It is not that those people lacked faith; rather, those who preached the gospel did not have the knowledge or the faith
From the time we begin to contact people, we must learn not to speak idle words, common words, or our own words
Although people may not believe it and may even oppose it, they still would admit that the teachings in the Bible are the highest
When you read the important verses to someone and then read the footnotes with him, he will definitely be touched
At this time, you must quickly get the water ready, not giving him any chance to have second thoughts, and baptize him immediately
When you go to the next level of visitation, you should not begin with idle words but rather say to him, 'This Bible verse is very good
There are two other matters we need to learn: to teach the new believers to sing hymns and to teach them to pray
We all know that however Christian meetings are conducted, four things are involved: the Spirit, God's word, hymns, and prayers
When we are filled with the spirit from within, we use psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs to speak, sing, and psalm to one another
When some people walk into a meeting, they give others the sense that they are icy cold, like blocks of ice from the Arctic Ocean
Sometimes your singing is wrong, but those who are musically gifted can correctly learn the song after following you for a while
After the time we go to someone's home to baptize him, the next time we meet in his home we can begin to teach him to sing
If the singing at the beginning is good, then the home meeting that follows will cause the whole family to be happy
Do not engage in meaningless small talk, such as how the weather is hot or cold and whether or not to wear warm clothes
It may seem as if you are talking to them; actually you are having them share the responsibility of the meeting
If your spirit is filled with the Lord and His word and you can sing and pray, then you are living, and whatever you do will be living
After singing a hymn in the Lord's table meeting, everyone begins to speak the hymn to one another, making the hymn so good and living
The hymns are spoken, and the Word and the spiritual publications are also spoken, but why are the two speakings so different?
In the fresh leading we have received of the Lord, our first step is to learn to visit people by door-knocking
Through baptism, we put him into the Lord's death, into the Lord, into the Triune God, and into the church, the Body of Christ
After we help someone to be saved, we must grasp the opportunity to set up a time with this new believer for another meeting
With the son comes his parents and children, with the daughter-in-law, her parents, and with the siblings, their wives
You should propagate this grace to your whole family, including all of your distant relatives, by delivering it to their homes'
Of course, we also should not be in unbelief but should admonish him steadfastly and continually until he is touched
In this way, within just two or three years, his relatives and friends will become linked to us, becoming our gospel targets
Generally speaking, there are only four things in the Christian meetings: the Spirit, the Word, singing, and praying
By reading church history, we know that the best European architecture from the Middle Ages was the cathedrals
When the Pharisees saw this, they murmured to the Lord's disciples, 'Why does your Teacher eat with the tax collectors and sinners'?
The Bible shows us that when the believers come into the meetings, they should have their mouths wide open and must speak
As soon as you open your mouth, your legs have no cramps, your back stops aching, you sleep well, and you have a good appetite'
They cannot understand much, they are often forgetful, and they are afraid of getting lost when they leave the house
The brothers and sisters must all exercise to function organically in the meetings, singing and reading the Word in an organic way
We have already seen that the Spirit, the Word, singing, and prayer are the four crucial elements of the meetings
We realize from experience that for us to have the Word, we must conscientiously study the truth and then use the truth to teach
In every home meeting, we need to present some items of the truth to the new believers for fifteen minutes, thirty minutes, or even longer
After a period of time, he will become perfected to the point that you can take him a step further into Truth Lessons
When we are about to teach, we need to spend some time in preparation to find an appropriate way to help the new one get into them easily
The new one has just been saved; we should not trouble him with this matter but first establish him by using the new Life Lessons
If within a month you cannot speak to a new one about the truth concerning the church, then wait for half a year
All the elders in the churches desire that the number of saints in their church meetings would increase more and more
Even the full-timers have disappeared; their presence is not visible in the meetings, yet they must be financially supported
Do not worry; the seeds sown in the fall, after passing through a winter and a spring, produce a rich harvest in May
The sowing work itself requires much labor-here a home, there a home, until very many homes in Taipei are gained and baptized
To have the harvest, we need to continue to nourish the new ones with the Word as milk and to perfect them with the truth
In this way, he will receive the appropriate help so that when he comes to the table meeting, he can enter into it right away
If you tell such a one to go east, he will insist on going west; if you ask him to go fast, he will be deliberately slow
He will say to us, 'Formerly this child of Mine was not being edified in the truth, but because of your faithfulness, he has been edified'
We still include them and week by week continue to visit them and have fellowship with them, teaching them the truth
