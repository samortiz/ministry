   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. THE ANGEL OF GOD PROTECTING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL FROM THE ARMY OF</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE EGYPTIANS BY THE PILLAR OF THE CLOUD</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 19 says, And the Angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Angel of God in this verse is the very Angel of Jehovah who called Moses in chapter three vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>2, 4, Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God called Moses in the person of the Angel of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Angel of Jehovah was simply Jehovah God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the words of 3:6, the Angel of Jehovah identified Himself, saying, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates that He was the Triune God, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Angel of Jehovah, who is the very Triune God, is Christ as God s sent One.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The fact that God s sent One went before the camp of Israel indicates that Christ was the One who was leading the people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, according to 14:19, the Angel of God moved from the front of the people to the rear.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This verse goes on to say, And the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the Angel of God moved, the pillar moved also.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This shows that He and the pillar were one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 20 continues, And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The pillar was a wall separating these two camps.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the Egyptian side of the wall there was darkness, but on the side facing God s people there was light.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This pillar of light protected God s people from the Egyptians.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can apply this to our experience in the Lord today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we began to follow the Lord, the Lord s guidance became a pillar of light to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From the time we first believed in the Lord Jesus, we have had the light within us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This light is the guiding light.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But when opposition rises up against us, the guiding light spontaneously becomes the protecting light.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The light that was once in front of us moves behind us to protect us from opposition and attack.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, to the opposers the protecting light becomes darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I can testify from my experience that whenever I have been opposed, the guiding light has moved behind me to become the protecting light.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Otherwise, due to the opposition, I may have been tempted to go backward.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I may have doubted the truth of what I had seen.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But because the guiding light becomes the protecting light, I have no way to return.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The light behind me is so bright that it is impossible to go backward.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, this protecting light becomes darkness to the opposers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the one hand, I am protected by the light; on the other hand, the opposers are wholly in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the principle seen in 14:19 and 20.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we are faithful to the Lord, His guiding light will become our protecting light whenever we face opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This light will also spontaneously become darkness to those who oppose us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because the opposers are in darkness and we are in the light, we are protected.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The fact that this light is Christ as the Angel of Jehovah indicates that the very Christ who is light to us may cause darkness to come upon the opposers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For those who follow the will of God, the guiding light becomes the protecting light.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But to those who oppose God s people, the light becomes darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Be assured that whenever you are attacked by such opposers, the opposing ones will be full of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In such a way the Lord protects His people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The pillar of cloud stood between the children of Israel and the Egyptians as a separating wall.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the side of God s people, there was light.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But on the side of the Egyptians, there was darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whether we are in light or in darkness depends on whether we follow the Lord or attack His people.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we are among the opposers, the pillar will be darkness to us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But if we follow the Lord, the pillar will give us light.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have pointed out that the light we receive from the Lord firstly guides us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then when opposition comes, it protects us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we do not have the guiding light, we cannot have the protecting light.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many of us can testify that after we have received light, we are protected by this light, no matter how intense the opposition may be.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we are attacked, we may be tempted by the enemy to doubt our way or our standing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But during such times of doubt, the light we have received is our confirmation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the protecting light.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Often the light grows brighter in times of opposition and persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As the light becomes brighter for us, the opposers sink further and further into darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Eventually, the opposers may be in such great darkness that they themselves no longer understand what they are talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Because they attack these who are following the Lord, they are fully in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As a result, they may suffer death in some form.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I have seen this take place many times.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Firstly the opposers were in darkness, but eventually they suffered death.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The more the opposers attack God s people, the more they themselves are in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Not only may they be in ignorance or blindness; they may also become illogical and unreasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They may be in such thick darkness that they lose their reason.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Suppose a friend or relative opposes you because you follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The more this one opposes you, the more he is in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Eventually, he may lose his senses and begin to act unreasonably.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>His words and behavior may be not only against the light and truth of God; they may also be against reason.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Nevertheless, while the attackers are in such thick darkness, you enjoy the shining of the protecting light.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Consider the situation among the religionists when the Lord Jesus was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>To the disciples, the Lord was light.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But to the religionists, He was a cause of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Because the religionists were in darkness, they spread evil rumors about the Lord and even twisted His words.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>For example, they twisted His word about destroying the temple and raising it up in three days Matt 26:61 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>On the side of the religionists, there was darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But on the side of the Lord and His disciples, there was light.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>For this reason, the Lord Jesus told the religionists that they were blind Matt 23:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Furthermore, when Saul of Tarsus was converted, the Lord charged him to turn others from darkness to light Acts 26:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The darkness the Lord was talking about here was particularly the darkness of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>At the time of Paul, Judaism was altogether in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The same is true of Catholicism, Protestantism, and the independent religious groups today.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The more those in these groups oppose the truth, the more they are in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He Himself was the testing stone.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Then in the book of Acts the apostles and later the churches became the testing stone.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Today we in the Lord s recovery have become the testing stone.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We have pointed out that the children of Israel were led by the Angel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He was the One who took the lead to bring them out of Egypt and to guide them through the wilderness into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Before chapter fourteen, He was present among the people, but His name was not mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>As we shall see, in 23:20 the Lord said, Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Furthermore, in the book of Zechariah we once again see the Angel of God 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This Angel, the sent One of God, the very One who led the children of Israel and protected them from the Egyptians, was still taking care of God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>When the Angel of God moved from the front of the people to the rear, the pillar moved also, for the Angel and the pillar were one.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>It is the same in our experience today.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>In our experience we cannot separate the Lord from the guiding Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>After Pharaoh served the purpose God had for him, he became a sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>I have often issued a warning not to become a sacrifice by opposing the church.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Nevertheless, some have not taken heed to this warning and have become sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The more they opposed the church, the more illogical and unreasonable they became.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Their unreasonable behavior was a sign that they were in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The more we are attacked and opposed as we follow the Lord, the brighter the guiding and protecting light becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Nevertheless, the opposers may continue their attack in spite of the darkness that envelopes them.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Surely Pharaoh must have seen the pillar that separated the children of Israel from the Egyptians.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>But still he did not call back his chariots.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Instead, having lost his reason, he continued his pursuit of God s people and became a sacrifice.</S>
