[1]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE ONE THE BACKGROUND AND SUBJECT
[2]  OF THE BOOK Scripture Reading: Gal 1:1-7; 3:1, 3; 4:17, 21; 5:2, 4; 6:12, 15
[3]  The books of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians form a cluster of Epistles which make up the heart of the divine revelation in the New Testament.
[4]  In verse 2 Paul speaks of the churches of Galatia, a province of the ancient Roman Empire.
[5]  In 1:4 Paul says that Christ gave Himself for our sins, that He might rescue us out of the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father.
[6]  According to this concept, the message of the gospel is that we were sinners and that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was incarnated and died on the cross for our sins so that we might be forgiven and saved.
[7]  1, 18 , the law of Christ the law of life, v. 2 , the Spirit v. 8 , eternal life v. 8 , the household v. 10 , the faith v. 10 , the cross of Christ v. 14 , the religious world, which has been crucified to Paul and to which Paul has been crucified v. 14 , the new creation v. 15 , peace v. 16 , mercy v. 16 , the Israel of God v. 16 , the brands of Jesus v. 17 , and the grace of Christ v. 18 . A number of these items can be found only in the writings of Paul, not in any of the four Gospels.
[8]  Grace is the Triune God, the Father, Son, and Spirit, processed to become our enjoyment.
[9]  Through Christ we enjoy the processed all-inclusive Triune God.
[10]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE THREE GOD S SON VERSUS MAN S RELIGION Scripture Reading: Gal 1:13-16
[11]  Verses 13 and 14 present a vivid picture of man s religion.
[12]  In verse 13 Paul says, For you have heard of my manner of life formerly in Judaism, that I persecuted the church of God excessively and ravaged it.
[13]  This was true at the time of Saul of Tarsus, it has been true throughout the centuries, and it is true today.
[14]  The focal point of the Bible is not practices, doctrines, or ordinances it is the living Person of the Son of God.
[15]  Concerning the Son of God, many are still under the influence of the traditional teachings in Christianity with respect to the Trinity.
[16]  The heart of God is fully occupied with the living Person of His Son.
[17]  Because His attention is focused on this living Person, God has no interest in giving us things such as immersion, tongues-speaking, healing, circumcision, the Sabbath, head covering, or doctrines about prophecy.
[18]  God s unique intention is to give us His Son as a living Person.
[19]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE FOUR THE REVELATION OF GOD S SON IN US Scripture Reading: Gal 1:15a, 16a; 2 Cor 3:14-17; 4:3-6
[20]  As a living Person, Christ is spiritual and mysterious.
[21]  In 2 Corinthians 4, Paul gives us the general case.
[22]  In 1:15 and 16 Paul says that it pleased God to reveal His Son in him.
[23]  Nothing is more pleasing to God than the unveiling, the revelation, of the living Person of the Son of God.
[24]  Paul s burden in writing the book of Galatians, and our need today, is that we be brought into a state where we are full of the revelation of the Son of God and thereby become a new creation with Christ living in us, being formed in us, and being enjoyed by us continually as the all-inclusive Spirit.
[25]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE FIVE THE FORMATION OF PAUL S APOSTLESHIP Scripture Reading: Gal 1:15-24
[26]  As we consider these verses, we need to see not only how Paul s apostleship was formed, but also how we can be formed into today s apostles, God s present-day sent ones.
[27]  In the Life-study of Ephesians we pointed out that all the believers in Christ can be apostles, those sent by the Lord to fulfill His purpose and to carry out His plan.
[28]  Paul was called to be an apostle through the grace of Christ, not through the law that came by Moses.
[29]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE SIX PAUL S FAITHFULNESS
[30]  In 2:1 and 2 Paul said, Then after a period of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus with me also.
[31]  In verses 4 and 5 Paul continues, And it was because of the false brothers, brought in secretly, who stole in to spy out our freedom which we have in Christ Jesus that they might bring us into slavery; to whom we yielded in subjection not even for an hour.
[32]  The false brothers were the Judaizers who perverted the gospel of Christ by smuggling the observances of the law into the church and who troubled the genuine believers in Christ 1:7 .
[33]  According to verse 7, those in Jerusalem realized that Paul had been entrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision, even as Peter with that of the circumcision.
[34]  In verse 13 Paul says, And the rest of the Jews joined him in hypocrisy.
[35]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE SEVEN FREEDOM IN CHRIST
[36]  VERSUS SLAVERY UNDER LAW Scripture Reading: Gal 2:4; 4:24-25, 28, 30-31; 3:3, 21; 2:20a; 5:1
[37]  In the book of Galatians Paul presents a number of contrasts between things that are superior and things that are inferior.
[38]  I. SLAVERY UNDER LAW A. The Law, Typified by Hagar,
[39]  Having No Position in God s Promise and Grace
[40]  We need to see something further concerning slavery under law.
[41]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE EIGHT THE TRUTH OF THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: Gal 2:5b, 14a, 16, 19-20a; 3:11, 23-25; 4:2; 6:15
[42]  In 2:5 and 14 Paul speaks of the truth of the gospel.
[43]  The word truth in these verses does not mean the doctrine or teaching of the gospel; it denotes the reality of the gospel.
[44]  In 3:25 Paul says, But faith having come, we are no longer under a child-conductor.
[45]  Now that Christ has come, God s purpose in giving the law has been fulfilled.
[46]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE NINE DEAD TO LAW BUT LIVING TO GOD Scripture Reading: Gal 2:19-20; 3:3; 5:16, 25; Rom 7:4, 6; 6:4, 8, 10
[47]  This message is a continuation of the foregoing message on the truth of the gospel.
[48]  The crucial point in that message was the organic union with Christ which takes place spontaneously when we believe in Christ.
[49]  In this message we shall go on to see that we have died to law so that we might live to God 2:19 .
[50]  It is by faith in Christ that we enter into such an organic union with Him.
[51]  We have pointed out that faith is the appreciation of Jesus.
[52]  In 2:19 Paul says, For I through law have died to law that I might live to God.
[53]  The law requires me, a sinner, to die, and according to that requirement Christ died for me and with me.
[54]  Hence, I have died in Christ and with Christ through the law.
[55]  To live to God means to be obligated to God in the divine life.
[56]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE TEN NO LONGER I, BUT CHRIST LIVING IN ME Scripture Reading: Gal 2:19-20; Rom 6:6a, 8; 2 Cor 5:14-15; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17; John 6:57b; Phil 1:21a
[57]  In this verse is one of the basic items of God s New Testament economy: no longer I, but Christ living in me.
[58]  According to God s economy, we should no longer live; rather, Christ should live in us.
[59]  According to the concept of an exchanged life, our life is terminated and Christ lives.
[60]  But we need a more thorough understanding of what it means to say that Christ lives in us.
[61]  In 2:20 Paul speaks both of Christ and of the Son of God.
[62]  The title Christ mainly denotes Christ s mission to carry out God s plan.
[63]  The Son of God loved us and purposely gave Himself for us that He might impart the divine life into us.
[64]  Paul says that the life we now live in the flesh we live in faith, the faith of the Son of God.
[65]  In His economy God s intention is for the processed Triune God to be wrought into our being to make us a new person, a new I. The old person, the old I, the I without God, is over; but the new person, the new I, the I with the Triune God in it, still lives.
[66]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE ELEVEN NOT NULLIFYING THE GRACE OF GOD Scripture Reading: Gal 2:21, 16, 20a; 3:3; 4:21; 5:2, 4, 16, 24-25; John 1:17; 6:57b; 15:4-5; 1 Cor 6:17; 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17; Rom 5:17-18, 21; 1 Tim 1:14
[67]  In 2:21 Paul says, I do not nullify the grace of God.
[68]  If we consider this verse in context, we see that to nullify the grace of God means that in our experience we do not have Christ living in us.
[69]  In verse 20 Paul says, It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.
[70]  This is a strong indication that for us as believers to nullify the grace of God is for us to deny Christ the opportunity to live in us.
[71]  Let us now consider according to the New Testament what this grace has done for us and what it will do for us.
[72]  Although man was created in God s image and likeness in order to express Him and represent Him, man became fallen.
[73]  Before the righteous God, our conduct is sinful, and in the eyes of the holy God, our nature is evil.
[74]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE TWELVE CHRIST CRUCIFIED Scripture Reading: Gal 3:1; 1:4; 2:20; 3:13; 2:21, 19; 5:24; 6:14-15
[75]  In the foregoing message we considered the grace of God.
[76]  Christ crucified has a great deal to do with our enjoyment of God s grace.
[77]  The enjoyment of the grace of God is altogether dependent on the crucifixion of Christ.
[78]  The crucifixion of Christ indicates that all the requirements of the law have been fulfilled by the death of Christ, and that Christ through His death has released His life that it may be imparted into us in His resurrection to free us from bondage under the law.
[79]  Galatians 2:21 says, I do not nullify the grace of God; for if righteousness is through law, then Christ has died for nothing.
[80]  This verse indicates that Christ died to fulfill the requirements of the law that we may have righteousness in Him.
[81]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE THIRTEEN CHRIST AND THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Gal 3:1-5, 13-14; 4:6; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17; Rom 8:2, 9-10
[82]  Chapter three of Galatians is crucial, but it is also extremely difficult to understand.
[83]  Paul mentions the hearing of faith both with respect to receiving the Spirit v. 2 and to God s supplying the Spirit v. 5 . Both the receiving of the Spirit and the supplying of the Spirit are related to the hearing of faith.
[84]  First Corinthians 15:45b says that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.
[85]  Second Corinthians 3:17 tells us that now the Lord is the Spirit.
[86]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE FOURTEEN HEARING OF FAITH VERSUS WORKS OF LAW
[87]  Scripture Reading: Gal 3:2, 5, 3, 20, 9, 14, 22-25; Rom 7:10-11, 24; 8:2, 6, 10-11, 30
[88]  Galatians 3:2 says, This only I wish to learn from you, Did you receive the Spirit by the works of law or by the hearing of faith?
[89]  Surely we have received the Spirit by the hearing of faith, not by the works of law.
[90]  God continues to supply the Spirit to us also through the hearing of faith, not at all by the works of law.
[91]  Law is related to the flesh Rom 7:5 and depends on the effort of the flesh, the very flesh that is the expression of I. Faith is related to the Spirit, and trusts in the operation of the Spirit, the very Spirit who is the realization of Christ.
[92]  If I were preaching the gospel to primitive people who had never heard of God, Christ, the Spirit, the cross, redemption, salvation, or eternal life, I would tell them that the true God is a loving and lovable God.
[93]  Concerning faith there are two aspects, the objective aspect and the subjective aspect.
[94]  Faith was not to be found in the Old Testament; it came with Jesus Christ.
[95]  Time and time again, we may hear of Christ and the church, of Christ s death and resurrection, and of how Christ has been processed to become the life-giving Spirit.
[96]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE FIFTEEN THE SPIRIT THE BLESSING OF THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: Gal 3:5, 8-9, 14; Eph 1:13; Acts 2:33, 39; John 7:39; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17; Phil 1:19 THE CONTRAST BETWEEN FAITH AND LAW
[97]  In chapter three there is a strong contrast between faith and law.
[98]  As the basis for the relationship between man and God, the law requires that man use his own effort to fulfill the law s requirements in order to please God.
[99]  In this chapter Paul covers at least twelve major subjects: Christ crucified; Christ and the Spirit; the hearing of faith versus works of law; the Spirit as the blessing of the gospel; the Spirit versus the flesh; the gospel preached to Abraham; the promise versus the law; faith replacing law; the seed of Abraham and the sons of Abraham; baptized into Christ; putting on Christ; and all one in Christ.
[100]  Galatians 3:13 and 14 say, Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse on our behalf; because it is written, Cursed is every one hanging on a tree, in order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations in Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
[101]  Because it combines the promise of the Spirit with the blessing of Abraham, verse 14 is extremely important.
[102]  The context of verse 14 indicates that the Spirit is the blessing which God promised to Abraham for all the nations and which has been received by the believers through faith in Christ.
[103]  The Spirit is the compound Spirit and actually is God Himself processed in His Trinity through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and descension, for us to receive as our life and our everything.
[104]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE SIXTEEN THE SPIRIT VERSUS THE FLESH Scripture Reading: Gal 3:2-3, 5, 14; 5:16-19; 1:16; 2:16; 4:23, 29; 5:13, 22; 6:8, 12-13; 4:6; 5:5, 25
[105]  In this message we come to a very crucial subject: the Spirit versus the flesh.
[106]  Because of the influence of our background in Christianity, our understanding of the terms Spirit and flesh in the New Testament is limited.
[107]  As we read this Epistle, we need to see that God s economy is to impart Himself as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit into us to produce an organic union between us and the Triune God so that we may express Him in a corporate way.
[108]  In a foregoing message we have pointed out that the works of law are contrary to the hearing of faith.
[109]  Faith is the way for God s people to apprehend, comprehend, grasp, enjoy, and participate in all that God is to His people through His having been processed to become the Spirit.
[110]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE SEVENTEEN THE GOSPEL PREACHED TO ABRAHAM Scripture Reading: Gal 3:6-11, 14, 16-17; Gen 12:7; Col 1:12b; Eph 3:6, 9, 11
[111]  When I first learned that long before Christ came the gospel was preached to Abraham, I was greatly surprised.
[112]  Galatians 3:8 says, And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the nations by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham: In you all the nations shall be blessed.
[113]  There are two main aspects of God s word to Abraham in Genesis 12: the first is that in him all nations would be blessed; the second is that the land would be given to Abraham s seed.
[114]  I. THE GOSPEL BY FAITH THROUGH MAN S BELIEVING
[115]  In 3:6-9 we see that the gospel is by faith through man s believing.
[116]  We are told that Abraham believed God and that God reckoned his believing as righteousness Gen 15:6 .
[117]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE EIGHTEEN THE PROMISE VERSUS THE LAW Scripture Reading: Gal 3:2b, 3b, 6, 9-11, 13-14, 17, 21-25
[118]  The New Testament reveals that, in eternity past, God made a purpose, a plan.
[119]  This is a brief statement of God s eternal purpose.
[120]  After the law with its ordinances was given to the people, God dealt with the children of Israel according to the law through the tabernacle.
[121]  The people did not contact God through the law, but they contacted Him through the tabernacle with the priesthood and the offerings.
[122]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE NINETEEN FAITH REPLACING LAW Scripture Reading: Gal 3:6-7, 9-10, 19a, 23-25; 4:2-3; Rom 2:12; 7:5; John 3:18; 16:9; 3:36; Acts 16:31; Rom 16:26; 2 Tim 4:7b; Jude 3, 20; John 3:15; Acts 6:7; 1 Tim 3:9
[123]  In the foregoing message we saw that the promise is versus the law.
[124]  In this message we shall see that faith replaces law.
[125]  The Spirit in this verse is the all-inclusive, compound Spirit, typified by the compound ointment in Exodus 30:23-25.
[126]  Faith was of God s original economy; the law was later added because of transgressions v. 19 . After Christ fulfilled the law through His death, God wanted His people to return to His original economy.
[127]  Faith in Christ brings us into the blessing God promised to Abraham, which is the promise of the Spirit v. 14 . This faith had brought the Galatian believers into the blessing in Christ.
[128]  In 3:19 Paul tells us that the law was added because of transgressions.
[129]  It is difficult to understand faith in a full way.
[130]  In Acts 6:7 we are told that many priests were obedient to the faith, and in 2 Timothy 4:7 Paul says that he kept the faith.
[131]  On God s side, the term the faith implies that God sent His Son to earth, that Christ died on the cross to accomplish redemption, that He was buried and was resurrected, that in resurrection He released the divine life and has become the life-giving Spirit all that He might enter into all those who believe in Him to be grace, life, power, sanctification, and everything to them.
[132]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE TWENTY THE SEED OF ABRAHAM
[133]  AND THE SONS OF ABRAHAM Scripture Reading: Gal 3:7, 9, 16, 19, 26-29
[134]  In Galatians 3 Paul speaks of the seed of Abraham vv.
[135]  As the unique seed of Abraham, Christ includes all the believers who have been baptized into Him 3:27-28 .
[136]  In one sense, when Christ died on the cross, He was crucified alone as our Redeemer.
[137]  To believe is to believe into Christ John 3:16 , and to be baptized is to be baptized also into Christ.
[138]  Faith in Christ brings us into Christ and makes us one with Christ, in whom is the sonship.
[139]  We must be identified with Christ through faith so that in Him we may be sons of God.
[140]  By both faith and baptism, we have been immersed into Christ, we have thus put on Christ, and we have become identified with Him.
[141]  Because we are one with Christ, we are also Abraham s seed, heirs according to promise, inheriting God s promised blessing, which is the all-inclusive Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed God to be our portion.
[142]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE BAPTIZED INTO CHRIST, PUTTING ON CHRIST,
[143]  Verse 27 opens with the word for, which connects these verses and indicates that verse 27 gives an explanation of how we are sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.
[144]  Since the death of Christ is included in Christ, and since Christ is the very embodiment of the Triune God, and the Triune God is eventually one with the Body of Christ, so to baptize new believers into the death of Christ, into Christ Himself, into the Triune God, and into the Body of Christ is to terminate their old life, on the negative side, and, on the positive side, to germinate them with new life, the eternal life of the Triune God, for the Body of Christ.
[145]  In Galatians 3:27 Paul says that as many as are baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
[146]  To put on Christ is to clothe ourselves with Christ, to put on Christ as a garment.
[147]  The reason for this lack of oneness is that so many have not experienced the proper and genuine baptism in which they are immersed into the Person of the Triune God, into Christ as the life-giving Spirit, into the death of Christ, and into the Body of Christ.
[148]  REPLACING THE CUSTODY OF THE LAW Scripture Reading: Gal 3:27-29; 4:1-7; Rom 8:14-16
[149]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that Paul concludes Galatians 3 with three important matters: baptized into Christ, putting on Christ, and the oneness of all the believers in Christ.
[150]  God s intention in His economy is to put us into Him and to come into us and live in us.
[151]  In this message we shall consider 4:1-7, where we see that the Spirit of sonship replaces the custody of the law.
[152]  In 3:1-14 we see that the Spirit is the blessing of the promise by faith in Christ; in 3:15-29, that the law is the custodian of the heirs of the promise; in 4:1-7 that the Spirit of sonship replaces the custody of the law; in 4:8-20, the necessity that Christ be formed in the heirs of promise; and in 4:21-31, that the children according to Spirit are versus the children according to flesh.
[153]  In 4:6 Paul declares, And because you are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father!
[154]  God s Son is the embodiment of the divine life 1 John 5:12 .
[155]  God gives us His Spirit of life, not because we are law-keepers, but because we are His sons.
[156]  In verses 4 and 6 we read of two kinds of sendings.
[157]  In verse 4 Paul says that God sent forth His Son, and in verse 6, that God sent forth the Spirit of His Son.
[158]  According to the promise in Genesis 3:15, Christ came under law as the seed of the woman in order to redeem those who were under law, that they might receive the sonship.
[159]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-THREE THE NEED FOR CHRIST TO BE FORMED
[160]  IN THE HEIRS OF PROMISE Scripture Reading: Gal 4:8-20
[161]  Paul s burden was not to carry on a Christian work, but was to minister Christ to the believers, to labor that Christ might be formed in them v. 19 . It is possible to work for the Lord and to help the saints, without having the burden to minister Christ to them.
[162]  Verse 12 says, Become as I am, because I also am as you, brothers, I beseech you.
[163]  Verse 17 says, They are zealous of you, not rightly, but they desire to shut you out, that you may be zealous of them.
[164]  The Greek word rendered zealous in this verse means to be jealously courting someone.
[165]  As we have indicated, verse 19 points out that Paul s burden was not to carry on a Christian work, but was to have Christ formed in the believers.
[166]  Through Paul s preaching, Christ had entered into the Galatians.
[167]  But because they had been deceived, Christ had not yet grown in them and had not been formed in them.
[168]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-FOUR TWO COVENANTS AND TWO KINDS OF CHILDREN Scripture Reading: Gal 4:21-31; 2:20a; 6:12-13, 15
[169]  In the previous message we pointed out that in 4:19 Paul says, My children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ is formed in you.
[170]  If we consider this verse in its context, we see that it is necessary for the heirs of the promise to have Christ formed in them.
[171]  The book of Galatians indicates that God s intention is for Christ to be wrought into His chosen people that they may become sons of God.
[172]  We have seen that in 4:8-20 Paul spoke in an affectionate manner and appealed to the personal feeling of the Galatians.
[173]  He did this for the purpose of ministering Christ to them.
[174]  To be born according to flesh is to be born by man s fleshly effort, whereas to be born through the promise is to be born through God s power in grace, which is implied in His promise.
[175]  Verse 29 says, But as then he that was born according to flesh persecuted him that was born according to Spirit, so also it is now.
[176]  Those brought forth by the covenant of law are born according to flesh; those brought forth by the covenant of promise are born according to Spirit.
[177]  The children born according to flesh have no right to participate in God s promised blessing, but the children born according to the Spirit have the full right.
[178]  Two thousand years after the desire of God s heart was unveiled to Abraham, Christ came.
[179]  Before the coming of Christ, we are not told in the Scriptures that God was happy or pleased.
[180]  God was happy to see the fulfillment of His desire by grace, which is actually a living Person, Christ, the Son of God, the embodiment of the Triune God.
[181]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-FIVE NOT BROUGHT TO NOUGHT FROM CHRIST Scripture Reading: Gal 5:1-6
[182]  The first four chapters of Galatians present a revelation of the gospel preached by the Apostle Paul.
[183]  If you compare the revelation in these chapters with that conveyed in the four Gospels, you will see that, in a certain sense, the revelation in these chapters is richer, deeper, and more profound than that in the Gospels.
[184]  In 5:4 Paul goes on to use an unusual expression, saying, You have been brought to nought from Christ, you who are justified by law; you have fallen from grace.
[185]  Different translations render the first part of 5:4 in different ways: Christ is become of no effect unto you KJV ; Ye are severed from Christ ASV ; Ye are deprived of all profit from the Christ Darby s New Translation .
[186]  To be brought to nought from Christ is to be reduced to nothing from Christ, deprived of all profit from Christ and so separated from Him Darby , so that He is made void of effect.
[187]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-SIX GETTING RID OF THE LEAVEN
[188]  In the foregoing message we saw that Paul spoke to the Galatian believers about not being brought to nothing from Christ 5:4 .
[189]  In verse 10 Paul says, I have confidence as to you in the Lord that in nothing you will be otherwise minded.
[190]  D. Not Letting the Stumbling Block of the Cross
[191]  In 5:11 Paul says, But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still being persecuted?
[192]  In 5:16 Paul tells us to walk by the Spirit.
[193]  The Christian walk is absolutely by the Spirit, not by the flesh.
[194]  To walk by the Spirit is to have our walk regulated by the Holy Spirit within our spirit.
[195]  Because of Christ s redemption and the Spirit s work of regeneration, we, who have received God s dispensation, can walk by the Spirit instead of by the flesh.
[196]  We have already pointed out that if we walk by the Spirit, we shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh.
[197]  Furthermore, if we walk by the Spirit, we shall be led by the Spirit.
[198]  Whenever we walk by the Spirit, we have the Lord s leading, even in such ordinary matters as the way we converse with others.
[199]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-EIGHT CRUCIFYING THE FLESH
[200]  Verse 24 says, But they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts.
[201]  A number of expositors have been troubled by the fact that verse 26 comes immediately after verse 25, where Paul speaks of walking by the Spirit.
[202]  The Bible teaches that the tripartite man created by God fell and sank lower and lower until he became flesh Gen 6:3 .
[203]  All fallen human beings are sinners in the flesh.
[204]  Through death and resurrection Christ has become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit and, as such, has entered into our spirit to regenerate us and to make our sonship real and practical.
[205]  As we consider 5:24 and 25 once again, we need to realize that through Christ s redemption and the Spirit s regeneration, we are now sons of God in position.
[206]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-NINE HOW TO RESTORE THE FALLEN ONE,
[207]  In 6:7-10 Paul covers the matter of how to sow.
[208]  In verse 7 he warns, Do not be led astray, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, this he shall also reap.
[209]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE THIRTY CRUCIFIED TO THE RELIGIOUS WORLD
[210]  Circumcision is an ordinance of law; the new creation is the masterpiece of life with the divine nature.
[211]  But the Son of God who has been revealed in us 1:16 can enliven us and make us a new creation, and Christ who lives in us 2:20 can afford us the riches of His life to live the new creation.
[212]  In 6:16 Paul goes on to say, And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy, even upon the Israel of God.
[213]  The rule Paul speaks of here is that of being a new creation, living by the Spirit through faith, not that of keeping the law through the observance of ordinances.
[214]  This rule, the rule of the new creation, is the processed Triune God being our life and our living.
[215]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-ONE THE BRANDS OF JESUS
[216]  AND THE GRACE OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Gal 6:17-18
[217]  In the foregoing message we considered Paul s word in 6:15: For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.
[218]  The word brands in verse 17 refers to the marks branded on slaves to indicate their owners.
[219]  With Paul, a slave of Christ Rom 1:1 , physically the brands were the scars of his wounds received in his faithful service to his Master 2 Cor 11:23-27 .
[220]  Spiritually, they signify the characteristics of the life he lived, a life like that lived by the Lord Jesus when He was on this earth.
[221]  Such a life is continually crucified John 12:24 , doing the will of God John 6:38 , seeking not its own glory but the glory of God John 7:18 , and submissive and obedient to God, even unto the death of the cross Phil 2:8 .
[222]  After referring to the brands of Jesus, Paul says, The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers.
[223]  The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ is actually the bountiful supply, the all-inclusive enjoyment, of the life-giving Spirit.
[224]  On the one hand, we bear the brands of Jesus, are persecuted, and live a crucified life; on the other hand, we enjoy the grace of Christ and experience the bountiful supply of the Spirit.
[225]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-TWO BORN OF THE SPIRIT TO RECEIVE THE SPIRIT 1 Scripture Reading: Gal 3:2-3, 5, 14; 4:4-6, 29
[226]  As believers in Christ, we all have been born of the Spirit to receive the Spirit.
[227]  Having been regenerated, born of the Spirit, we should daily receive the Spirit.
[228]  Because we have been created by God, we are God s creatures, and because we are fallen, we are sinners.
[229]  Although regeneration is a marvelous reality, my burden in this message is not on regeneration itself.
[230]  Only by being the Spirit is God able to regenerate us.
[231]  Galatians 3:5 says, He therefore Who is supplying to you the Spirit and doing works of power among you, is it by the works of law or by the hearing of faith?
[232]  Likewise, after God regenerated us by His Spirit to make us His sons, He has been continually supplying to us the Spirit.
[233]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-THREE BORN OF THE SPIRIT TO RECEIVE THE SPIRIT 2 Scripture Reading: Gal 4:29; 3:2, 5, 14; John 3:6b; 7:39; 14:17; 20:22; 6:63; Rom 8:15b; Eph 6:17-18; 1 Thes 5:17-19; 1 Cor 6:17; Matt 10:19-20 GOD S ULTIMATE INTENTION
[234]  The most crucial and mysterious matter revealed in the Bible is that God s ultimate intention is to work Himself into His chosen people.
[235]  God s desire to work Himself into our being is the focal point of the divine revelation in the Scriptures.
[236]  If we do not take the Word and receive the Spirit, what way is there for God to be wrought into us?
[237]  If to us God is only on the throne in heaven as the object of our worship, how can He be our life and how can He be wrought into our being?
[238]  As we have already indicated, we may receive the Spirit by using the Bible in a proper way.
[239]  However, when most Christians come to the Bible, they exercise their mind much more than their spirit.
[240]  We all need to read the Bible, but we should exercise our spirit as we read it.
[241]  This means that when we read the Bible, we must pray.
[242]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-FOUR LIVE AND WALK BY THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Gal 5:16-18, 22-25
[243]  In 4:5 Paul says that God has redeemed us so that we might receive the sonship.
[244]  To receive the sonship means that we are born of God and thereby receive the divine life and nature.
[245]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-FIVE SOW UNTO THE SPIRIT TO REAP ETERNAL LIFE Scripture Reading: Gal 6:7-10 THE FOCAL POINT OF GALATIANS
[246]  The book of Galatians is focused on Christ replacing the law.
[247]  Thus, Christ as the center of God s economy must replace the law.
[248]  This is somewhat different from 2:20, where the contrast is between Christ and I. The Spirit in chapter three is the very realization of the Christ in chapter two, and the flesh is the experiential aspect of the I. Doctrinally we may say that our problem is with the I, the self, but in experience our problem is with the flesh, which is the totality of our fallen being.
[249]  Finally, in chapter six, we have the contrast between two different kinds of sowing: the sowing unto the flesh and the sowing unto the Spirit 6:7-8 .
[250]  On the one hand, we may sow unto the flesh to accomplish the purpose of the flesh.
[251]  In the first two chapters of Galatians we have the revelation of Christ as the focal point of God s economy, but in the last four chapters we have the Spirit in our experience.
[252]  Paul s words strongly imply that we must make a decision with respect to our aim, our goal.
[253]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-SIX SOW UNTO THE SPIRIT
[254]  FOR THE NEW CREATION Scripture Reading: Gal 6:7-16
[255]  Because the Galatian believers were missing the mark of God s economy, Paul wrote them this Epistle in the attempt to unveil God s economy and to bring them back to Christ.
[256]  They had been distracted from the experience of Christ and the enjoyment of Christ to the keeping of the law and the practice of circumcision.
[257]  Paul wanted them to turn back from the law and circumcision to the real blessing of God s gospel the blessing of the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.
[258]  After pointing out that the Judaizers wanted the Galatian believers to be circumcised so that they could boast in the flesh of the Galatians, Paul says, But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through Whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world.
[259]  Instead of boasting in circumcision, Paul boasted in the cross of Christ.
[260]  We all need a governing, directing, controlling vision of the Triune God as our goal.
[261]  If we see this vision, we shall be governed and directed by it.
[262]  I can testify that by the Lord s mercy I saw this vision more than half a century ago, and I have not been distracted from it.
[263]  If we see the vision of the Triune God as our goal, we shall not sow unto the flesh, but unto the Spirit, the all-inclusive Triune God dwelling in our spirit.
[264]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-SEVEN RECEIVING AND ENJOYING THE GRACE
[265]  Paul ends the book of Galatians in this way: The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers.
[266]  At the beginning of this Epistle, Paul said, Grace to you and peace from God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ 1:3 .
[267]  In order to understand what Paul means by grace in 6:18, we need to turn to the Gospel of John.
[268]  In this Gospel we read that the Word which was in the beginning with God, and which was God, became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace and reality 1:1, 14 .
[269]  To say that the Spirit is the Spirit of grace does not mean that the Spirit is one thing and grace is another, just as the expression the Spirit of life does not mean that the Spirit and life are two different things.
[270]  LIFE STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-EIGHT TWO KINDS OF WALK BY THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Gal 5:16, 22-23, 25; 6:15-16; 3:2-3, 5, 14; 4:6, 29; Rom 6:4; 8:4; 4:12; Phil 3:16-18
[271]  In this message we shall begin to consider the matter of two kinds of walk by the Spirit.
[272]  Galatians 5:25 says, If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.
[273]  In order to understand more adequately the two kinds of walk by the Spirit, we need to see that the book of Galatians is a book that is very much concerned with the Spirit.
[274]  This term is found in John 7:39: But this He said concerning the Spirit, Whom those who believed in Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.
[275]  But after His resurrection, His death and resurrection were blended with the Spirit of God to form the Spirit, the compound Spirit including not only divinity, but also humanity, the effectiveness of Christ s death, and the power of His resurrection.
[276]  This process began at the time of Christ s incarnation and continued throughout His human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.
[277]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-NINE WALKING IN THE DIVINE RULES AND STEPS
[278]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that there are two kinds of walk by the Spirit.
[279]  If we would have the first kind of walk by the Spirit, we need to pray and call on the name of the Lord.
[280]  In 1 Thessalonians 5:17 Paul commands us to pray without ceasing.
[281]  If we consider Galatians 5:25 in light of the other verses where the Greek word stoicheo is used for walk, we shall see that to walk by the Spirit is to walk by the Spirit as our rule.
[282]  The Spirit Himself is the way, the rule, the line, the principle, leading toward God s goal.
[283]  If we would have the second walk by the Spirit, we must take the Spirit as our rule, our way.
[284]  In Philippians 3:16 Paul says, Only this, whereunto we have attained, by the same rule let us walk.
[285]  According to the context of this chapter, the rule in verse 16 is the pursuing after Christ mentioned in verse 12.
[286]  Because Paul wanted to gain more of Christ, he pursued Christ.
[287]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE FORTY WALKING BY THE SPIRIT
[288]  Colossians and Galatians are two books in the New Testament which reveal that Christ is life and everything to us.
[289]  Both the culture devised by man and the law given by God have been used by Satan to frustrate God s chosen people from experiencing Christ and enjoying Him.
[290]  God s intention is to dispense Himself as the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, into our being so that He and we may be organically one.
[291]  In chapter three Paul begins to speak of the Spirit.
[292]  In verse 2 he inquires of the Galatian believers, Did you receive the Spirit by the works of law or by the hearing of faith?
[293]  In chapter one we have the Son of God revealed in us and in chapter two, Christ living in us.
[294]  In 4:6 we see that we have not only received the Spirit, but that the Spirit of God s Son has entered into us.
[295]  The first kind of walk by the Spirit is for the second that of taking the Spirit as the path for our way.
[296]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE FORTY-ONE WALKING BY THE SPIRIT TO LIVE CHRIST Scripture Reading: Gal 1:13-15a, 16a; 2:19-20; 3:2, 5, 26-27; 4:6, 19, 29; 5:16, 18, 22-23; 6:18
[297]  In the book of Galatians God s two economies, His Old Testament economy and His New Testament economy, are dealt with in a full way.
[298]  In contrast to the Jews, who love the law, we who believe in Christ would all say that we prefer Christ to the law.
[299]  Before you were saved, you might have paid little attention even to your self-made laws.
[300]  But after you were saved and especially after you began to seek the Lord in the church life, your self-made laws began to exert a very strong influence on your daily living.
[301]  You can say truly that you love the Lord and seek Him, but can you honestly say that you live Christ day by day?
[302]  In 2:20 Paul goes on to say, I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God, Who loved me and gave Himself for me.
[303]  Here we see that the very Christ who had been revealed into Paul now lived in him.
[304]  The two, Christ and Paul, had one life and one living.
[305]  In chapter four we see that Christ has redeemed us so that we may receive the sonship v. 5 . Moreover, because we are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba Father! v. 6 . In a foregoing message we pointed out that we became sons of God through a process of conception and birth.
[306]  For Christ to be formed in us requires that we forget our self-made laws and allow Christ to occupy us in full.
[307]  The more Christ occupies us inwardly, the more He is formed within us.
[308]  To walk by the Spirit here actually means to live Christ, to move, act, and have our being according to the indwelling Spirit.
[309]  According to His New Testament economy, God s intention is to dispense Christ into us and to make Christ one with us and us one with Him.
[310]  For this reason, I am rather concerned that many of us still do not fully realize that as those who are saved and regenerated by the Spirit of God with the divine life and nature, we are now one spirit with God.
[311]  According to 6:15 and 16, the second kind of walk by the Spirit is intimately related to the new creation.
[312]  Verse 15 declares, For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.
[313]  The new creation is the new man in Christ Eph 4:24 , our inner being regenerated by the Spirit John 3:6 , having God s life and the divine nature wrought into it John 3:36; 2 Pet 1:4 , with Christ as its constituent Col 3:10-11 .
[314]  If we have the second kind of walk by the Spirit, an orderly walk according to God s eternal purpose, we shall become a new creation in a very practical way, and we shall also be the Israel of God, representing God, exercising His authority, and carrying out His administration on earth for the fulfillment of His purpose.
[315]  IN THE ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST IN OUR SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Gal 5:16, 25; 6:16, 18
[316]  In God s New Testament economy He first makes us His sons and then the new creation and the Israel of God.
[317]  Toward the end of Galatians, Paul speaks both of a new creation 6:15 and of the Israel of God v. 16 . The fact that he refers to these matters in the conclusion of the book is an indication of their importance.
[318]  Hence, it is crucial that we have a proper understanding of the new creation and also of the Israel of God.
[319]  We who believe in Christ Jesus also have a dual status.
[320]  To walk according to the basic principle of the new creation is to walk in a regulated way like soldiers marching in cadence.
[321]  It is this kind of walk which causes the churches to have impact.
[322]  The reason the so-called church is weak is that the believers do not have the second kind of walk by the Spirit.
[323]  John 3:6 says, That which is born of the Spirit is spirit ; John 4:24, God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit ; Romans 8:16, The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit.
[324]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE FORTY-FOUR WALKING BY THE SPIRIT AS SONS OF GOD 1 Scripture Reading: Rom 8:2, 4-6, 9-11, 13-16, 23, 26, 29; Gal 3:2-3, 5, 11b-14, 26; 4:4-6, 29; 5:16-18
[325]  In the New Testament the books of Romans and Galatians stand together in a special category.
[326]  Again and again, the books of Romans and Galatians speak of the Spirit.
[327]  Because we have a spirit of sonship, we have the life of the Son of God.
[328]  In verse 9 Paul speaks of the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ and in verses 11 and 13, of the Spirit.
[329]  The expression the Spirit is also found in verse 16: The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God.
[330]  Although the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jehovah, and the Holy Spirit were in existence before the glorification of Christ, the Spirit was not.
[331]  After we are born of God to be sons of God, we then must walk as sons according to the Spirit.
[332]  In Romans 8 Paul does not speak of things such as humility, faithfulness, or honesty.
[333]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that the books of Romans and Galatians reveal not only God s redemption, but also the economy of God s redemption.
[334]  Although the word economy cannot be found in either Romans or Galatians, God s economy in His salvation is nonetheless implied.
[335]  The economy of God has its arrangement, management, and stewardship related to God s dispensation of Himself in the Son through the Spirit into His chosen and redeemed people.
[336]  Genesis 1:26 says that God created man in His image and after His likeness.
[337]  For many Christians today, the Trinity is simply a matter of theology, not of experience.
[338]  However, in the Bible the Trinity is not presented as a doctrine.
[339]  There are verses which teach us concerning justification by faith, but there is not one verse teaching us about the Trinity in a doctrinal way.
[340]  For example, 2 Corinthians 13:14 says, The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all lit.
[341]  Concerning our living as human beings there are three main kinds of teachings.
[342]  LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE FORTY-SIX WALKING ACCORDING TO
[343]  THE ELEMENTARY RULES Scripture Reading: Gal 5:25; 6:8, 12-16, 18; Phil 3:14-16
[344]  In Galatians 5 Paul speaks twice about walking by the Spirit.
[345]  In verse 25 he goes on to say, If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.
[346]  No matter what our nationality may be, we all unconsciously or subconsciously hold to certain principles.
[347]  We all have our own basic principles or elementary rules.
