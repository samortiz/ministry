   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR NEED FOR CHRIST AS OUR LIFE SUPPLY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In our Christian life, we daily need the experience of contacting the Spirit in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We should not be satisfied merely to read a few chapters of the Bible each day or take a portion of the Word in morning watch.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whenever we come to the Word, we need to exercise our entire being, especially our spirit, to contact Christ, who is now the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We definitely need to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But it is crucial that we contact the Spirit in the Word by exercising our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we do this, we shall take in Christ as our food supply.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We shall receive the Spirit as the heavenly manna.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have seen that Christ is the bread of life, the bread of God, the heavenly bread, the living bread, and the true bread.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today this bread is not merely the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ, but the Christ who has become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In chapter three of John we have the case of a religious gentleman, and in chapter four, the case of an immoral Samaritan woman.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then in chapter five we see that apart from Christ and without Christ everything is empty.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The crucial point in chapter six is that we are hungry and need Christ as our food.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today this Christ is not merely the incarnated and crucified One, nor merely the resurrected and ascended One.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is now the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we do not know our need and if we do not know what Christ is today, we shall be empty.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need Christ as our life supply, and today Christ is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Day by day we should exercise our spirit to contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Just as we have three meals every day, so we need to eat Christ as the bread of life again and again during the day.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even every moment we need to eat the One who is the Spirit who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The One who is our Creator, Redeemer, Savior, Lord, and Master is the life-giving Spirit for us to contact all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are hungry and need food.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even though you may have been a Christian for many years, every day you are still hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ is not only your life; He is also your life supply, your daily food.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all need Christ as He is revealed in chapter six of John.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Yes, we have passed through chapters three, four, and five.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But now in chapter six we are hungry ones around the sea in Galilee, and we need Christ as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need Him to be our barley loaves and fish.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need Him as the generating life and the redeeming life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is as the Spirit that Christ is this life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Spirit who gives life is the generating life, the redeeming life, and the overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need this Spirit as our life and life supply, as our food for daily nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is important that we all see this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I hope that we all shall be helped to realize our need for Christ as our life supply and then daily contact Him as the life-giving Spirit embodied in the Word.</S>
