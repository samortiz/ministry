   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE COUNTERPART OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In his exhortation in Ephesians 5:22-33, Paul presents the church as the counterpart of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This reveals that the church is actually a part of Christ, for the church comes out of Christ and is unto Christ, just as Eve came out of Adam and was unto Adam Gen 2:21-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first couple in the Bible, Adam and Eve, is a picture of Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In His creation, God did not create a man and woman at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He first created a man, and then from the man He created a counterpart to help him Gen 2:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the fowl, the beasts, and the cattle were brought before Adam, Adam named them one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But for Adam "there was not found a help meet for him'' Gen 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Adam desired to have a counterpart, to have someone to match him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, among the fowl, the beasts, and the cattle, he could not find his counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to produce such a counterpart, God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam Gen 2:21 , and He took a rib out of Adam and built a woman with the rib Gen 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The name of the woman was Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eve was the same as Adam in life, nature, and form.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, she could be his counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When God brought Eve to Adam, Adam exclaimed, "This time it is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh'' Gen 2:23, Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At last, Adam had found one who could be his counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Genesis 2:24 indicates that a man and his wife are one flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The husband and the wife are two halves of a whole person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a marvelous picture of Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eve had the same life and nature that Adam had.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This signifies that the church has the same life and nature that Christ has.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, Eve had virtually the same image and nearly the same stature as Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This indicates that the church bears the same image and has the same stature as Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church as the counterpart of Christ implies satisfaction and rest in love.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every husband needs satisfaction and rest, which are found in love.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The brothers who are husbands can testify that our satisfaction and rest can only be in our wives.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we say that we are the church, then we must ask if Christ has His rest among us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A group of Christians should not be so quick to claim that they are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To be the church is to render to Christ the adequate satisfaction and rest in love.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ needs such a counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church is not merely a gathering of God's called ones.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The church, as Christ's counterpart, is a satisfaction and rest to Christ in love.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A. The Church as the Bride, the Wife, of Christ as the Bridegroom, the Husband</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church is the bride, the wife, of Christ, who is the Bridegroom, the Husband.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The word of John the Baptist in John 3:29 indicates that Christ is the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"He who has the bride is the bridegroom.''</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The bridegroom is a most pleasant person, who comes for the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church should be a corporate bride prepared for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To us He should be the attraction, the pleasure, and the satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As those who constitute the counterpart of Christ, we should enjoy Him as such a pleasant Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In 2 Corinthians 11:2 Paul speaks concerning Christ as the Husband.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>"I am jealous over you with a jealousy of God; for I betrothed you to one Husband, to present a pure virgin to Christ.''</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Here we see that Christ is the believers' Husband, the unique Husband for us to love.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should belong only to Him, and we should appreciate Him and love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As our Husband, Christ has attracted us, and we have been presented as a pure virgin to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now we should care only for Him, allowing nothing to replace Him in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our love for Him should be pure, and our whole being should be focused on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As Eve was Adam's increase, so the church as the bride, the wife, of Christ as the Bridegroom, the Husband, is Christ's increase.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After John the Baptist referred to Christ as the Bridegroom, he went on to say, "He must increase, but I must decrease'' John 3:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The increase in verse 30 is the bride in verse 29.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For the Lord to increase means that He must have the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All the following must go to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All those who believe in Him should follow Him to be His bride as His increase.</S>
