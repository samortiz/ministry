   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE BEGINNING OF THE WORK IN THE UNITED STATES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today the earth is in desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although there is a general preaching of the gospel, there is no gospel concerning the hidden mystery or the high gospel concerning Christ in us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is no easy task to open up a wasteland, but it is an indisputable fact that there are millions of people scattered in every major continent of the world, waiting for people to save their souls.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is a glorious matter for us to go out for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the one hand, we reap the harvest wherever we go.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although we are not the ones who sowed, the Lord has already sown through others, so all we need to do is to reap.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the other hand, we ourselves need to go out to sow the seeds.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then after we sow the seeds, there will certainly be a harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We had this experience when we began our work in America.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We traveled from the east coast to the west coast, and from the west back to the east.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We also traveled from south to north and from north to south.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Within a few years, our traveling covered most of America, and we reaped a harvest in almost every place.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There were three to five persons in one state, five or six in another, and others elsewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In less than two years, we reaped many people here and there in each state.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the church in Los Angeles was raised up, the numbers increased quickly from tens of people to a hundred people, from one hundred to one hundred fifty, and then from one hundred fifty to two hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These persons were brought in during 1963, 1964, and no later than 1965 when the work in the United States first began.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Eventually in 1970 at the International Conference in Los Angeles, a revival was ushered in as a result of our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The fire of our spread began in the summer of 1964.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some wanted to move to Alaska, some to Nebraska, and some to other places.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At that time the tide of migration was so prevailing that many did not know how to respond.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, the Lord clearly showed us that it was not yet the appropriate time to spread.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, the Lord gave us grace to stay where we were for another three years.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those three years were truly a wonderful period in which we all became better equipped.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 1970 the number of people who attended the International Conference exceeded one thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>During this year everyone wanted to spread out through migration.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many of the saints were praising and leaping, although they were also shedding tears, being reluctant to depart from Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the day they left Los Angeles, some made a detour from their homes to the meeting hall on Elden Street to catch a last glimpse, and they could not hold back their tears.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They were richly blessed and edified there, and Elden had left an eternal impression on them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That wave of migration resulted in the spread to between twenty and thirty localities, such as Chicago and other places.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This migration proceeded quickly and had a great impact.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In not more than two years, the Lord s recovery had reached two to three thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In a conference at the Los Angeles Convention Center in 1973, the number of attendants exceeded three thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Large crowds gathered both inside and outside of the meeting place.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From that day onward, our concept was changed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We realized that we should no longer hold big conferences but that we should begin to conduct trainings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Big conferences are open in nature, and anyone could join, but trainings required a process of approval.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, since 1974 we have conducted trainings twice a year.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>People have had to register and be approved by the various churches.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That was the beginning of the life-study training.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We praise the Lord that this has gone on for thirteen years without interruption.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>History shows us that what we have today is precious.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, we should go everywhere with boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we first arrived in the United States to begin our work here, we could not say that there was no opposition in such a large Christian nation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Nevertheless, we have maintained a positive attitude until this day.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is not the case that there has been no opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Rather, there have been all kinds of opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, whenever we engage in a conversation with an opposer, our attitude is always that no matter what they say, we have a treasure that they do not have.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As we speak with them, we present to them the truth that the Lord has revealed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We can show them the treasure at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, when the opposers want to display their treasure, they have nothing to show.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the real situation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>THE SECRET TO THE SUCCESS OF THE NEW WAY According to the Operation of His Power in Us</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Regardless of whether you are old or young, you should have a realization that there is a power in us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you want to lead an easy life, I must tell you that this is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If an appliance could talk, it may ask the electricity to pause for a while and allow it to have a good rest.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, electricity has no way to pause.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For this reason, Paul told us to struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In 1963 or 1964, a brother from the Brethren assembly came from the United States to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In Taichung he met a Western missionary who was also in the Brethren assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As they began to converse, he compared the missionary work of the Brethren assembly there to a drop of water on a fingertip, and our work in Taiwan to a bucket of water.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This brother said that no one could outrun us, and no one struggled as much as we did.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I have been laboring in the United States for twenty-three years, and I have never taken a vacation.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This surprises the Americans.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Whether they are in school or at work, Americans go on vacation several times a year.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, they find me strange because I work all day continuously and never plan a vacation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The more I read the New Testament, the more I wonder if Paul ever had a vacation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Even if he went on vacation outwardly, he could not be on vacation inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He said that there was a crowd of cares pressing upon him daily, the anxious concern for all the churches 2 Cor 11:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This passage of the Scriptures not only encourages us, but above all it points to us a way, showing us that Paul not only had a treasure but that this treasure had become a mighty power within him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He showed us particularly that he was one who struggled.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we were to go on a vacation, this operating power would leave us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Therefore, although we have a power operating within us, we still have to endeavor to strive and struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We should not fear any opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>All we have to do is bring the treasure with us and struggle day and night to present this treasure to others.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Paul says in 2 Corinthians 4:7 that he had a treasure within him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This treasure in him was not dull and dormant, but rather it was an operation, an operating power.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The word dynamo, which we derive from the Greek word for power, is used to describe the operating force of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This indicates that the treasure within us is full of energy.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Nevertheless, Paul says that he still needed to struggle to present this treasure to others.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We all have read the fourteen Epistles written by him, which reveal the wonderful riches of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>However, the process of writing these fourteen Epistles was filled with much labor and hardship.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We may compare this labor to the operation of the jewelry and jade shops in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The shops may be full of precious jewels, but if the shop owner is slothful, and the front of the store is a mess, no one will want to go in and buy the jewels.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The shop owner still needs to furnish the shop so that it looks elegant and graceful and displays the treasures in a way that others will see that they are of high value.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>All this requires much time and effort.</S>
