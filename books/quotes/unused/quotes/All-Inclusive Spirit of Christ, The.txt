They believe that God is the only God, the mighty God, but they do not believe that this God has ever been a child
With many other verses, the Scripture assures us that the Christ whom we have received as our Savior is God Himself
In Isaiah 9:6 there is a parallel line: that is, 'unto us a son is given and his name shall be called The everlasting Father'
The Scripture tells us clearly that the Son is called the Father, and the Son Himself tells us that He and the Father are one
The Holy Spirit communicates the grace of Christ and the grace of Christ is the expression of the love of Godthree forms but one substance
The Lord answered, 'Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven'
All the fullness of the Father is in the Son; all that is in the Son is in the Spirit; and all that is in the Spirit is in the man
He works within us not in a miraculous way, but many times in a very human way-in fact, so humanly that we can hardly believe it is His work
We need this death not only in an objective way for our redemption, but also in a subjective way for our deliverance
The death of Christ, as a great deliverance to us, is a killing element, killing our selfish, natural life and so many negative things
Now He is the transcendent One in the heavens, enthroned with authority and established as the Head and Lord of all
If we will take Him as our life and experience Him day by day, we will sense many times the humanity and the human living
After His resurrection, He met two disciples on the way to Emmaus and told them He had already entered into His glory
In the morning He was resurrected, and in the evening He came to His disciples and breathed on them, saying, 'Receive ye the Holy Spirit'
In the Old Testament, there was not such a mingling, although many times the Spirit of God came upon the prophets and certain other persons
He passed through death, conquering and subduing it, and entered into resurrection, with which, as we have seen, is glorification
We must realize that the Holy Spirit in the New Testament is different from the Spirit of God in the Old Testament
The Spirit of God in the Old Testament was only of one element, divinity, because He was solely the Spirit of God
It is only in connection with the work He has to do in preparing the way for Christ, and a body for Him, that the proper name comes into use
The Holy Spirit could come down as the Spirit of the God-man- most really the Spirit of God, and yet as truly the Spirit of man
Let us now read Acts 16:7: 'After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia; but the Spirit suffered them not'
It should read 'the Spirit of Jesus,' as translated in the American Standard Version and the Amplified New Testament
Why was it that when the apostle Paul would go to a certain place to preach the Gospel, 'the Spirit of Jesus' suffered him not?
It was the Holy Spirit that was leading the apostle but the Holy Spirit at that time and in that incident was acting as the Spirit of Jesus
In Romans 8 it is 'the Spirit of Christ' that raises us up from any kind of death-element and animates us by imparting life into us
By the Spirit of Christ we partake of His resurrection life, His resurrection power, His transcendency and His reigning authority
Since the Spirit of God today is the Spirit of Jesus and the Spirit of Christ, we have 'the Spirit of Jesus Christ' in Philippians 1:19
If we give our attention to this all-inclusive Spirit, we will continually experience the working of these items within us
It does not matter whether we have been educated regarding it or not; as long as we take the dose, we will experience the killing element
If we only have Romans 6 without Romans 8, it is like having a book about electricity, but not the electricity itself
Our need is not the teaching nor the knowledge about Christ and His cross, but the experience of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
Many times when we are in the Spirit we sense something within us so living, so energizing, so strengthening and so empowering
The more depression, suppression, and even oppression, the more something within us is energizing, living and rising up
When we have this Spirit moving within us, we will frequently sense a suffering energy and a suffering capacity
The more spiritual we are, the more we will be troubled, but we will be filled with the Spirit of Jesus, who will enable us to suffer
Today He is within us as the foretaste through whom we enjoy all the riches of Christ with all the fullness of God
Since the Lord Jesus Christ is the all-inclusive Spirit, this word means that the all-inclusive Spirit is in our spirit
They grow a little today and a little tomorrow, and many wonderful and beautiful things come out of this gradual growth of life
