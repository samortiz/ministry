We humbly say that we are not worthy to touch it. Lord, we take You as our refuge. We take the Lamb&#8217;s blood as our victory. We do not trust in what we do. We trust in Your mercy. We trust in Your blessing. We trust in Your presence, under Your anointing. We trust in Your Word, the living Word. We trust in Your Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit. Be with us in this meeting. We thank You for the past three messages. We hand over this meeting into Your hand for Your blessing. Amen.<p>I hope that we all can see that the New Jerusalem is nothing else but God Himself wrought into us to be this structure. This structure is mainly of three parts: its base, its gates, and its wall with all the foundations. These are the three Persons of the Divine Trinity. The gold as the base of the city is God the Father; the pearls as the gates of the city are God the Son; and the wall of the city is God the Spirit. The Father as the base, the Son as the gates, and the Spirit as the wall are the Triune God wrought into His chosen people to have such a structure standing in the universe marvelously and uniquely. The New Jerusalem is the Triune God, the Divine Trinity, as three basic factors, wrought into and structured together with His redeemed as the conclusion of the whole Bible. I hope that many of us in the Lord&#8217;s recovery would go around the globe telling people everywhere nothing else but the New Jerusalem. All of Christianity needs to hear this. Thank the Lord that we have seen the New Jerusalem as the unique conclusion of the entire holy Word.<p>In this message we want to see the furnishings of the New Jerusalem. If a building is completed, yet it is without furnishings, it still cannot be used. The divine building is structured with three basic parts plus furnished with three furnishings. The three furnishings of the New Jerusalem are the throne, the temple, and the lamp.<h2 class=head1>I. ITS THRONE</h2><h2 class=head2>A. The Throne of God and of the Lamb- the Redeeming God</h2><p>The first furnishing is the throne of the redeeming God (Rev. 22:1). Today there are kings and queens on many thrones, but the day will come when in the entire universe there will be a central city, and the center of that central city will be the throne of God. The Possessor of that throne will be the redeeming God, God and the Lamb. For eternity we cannot forget that He is not only our God but also our Redeemer. He has redeemed us back to Himself, and now we are centered around His throne.<h2 class=head3>1. Founded on Its Base to Be One with Its Base according to God&#8217;s Divine Nature</h2><p>The throne of God is founded on a golden base, which is God Himself. This throne is also one with the base. The throne and the base are one, one piece of gold (cf. 1 Kings 10:18).<h2 class=head3>2. The Source and Goal of Its Divine Administration</h2><p>The throne has a source, and the throne is the source; and the throne has a goal, and the throne is the goal. It is the source flowing out and the goal coming back. This is the divine traffic, and this traffic is the administration. This traffic, this administration, is signified by a golden street, which is the base itself. If I were to ask, &#8220;Do you have a throne?&#8221; you should say, &#8220;In the past I didn&#8217;t have a throne, but today I do. I am not a person without a throne in the universe. I have the throne of God and I am in His administration.&#8221;<h2 class=head3>3. Also the Source of Its Divine Fellowship, Signified by the Street with Its Communication, Flowing with Its Supply</h2><p>The throne is not only the source of God&#8217;s administration but also the source of the divine fellowship. The street signifies not only the traffic of God&#8217;s administration but also the fellowship of God&#8217;s redeemed. This divine fellowship, signified by the street with its communication, flows with the divine supply. This supply is the river of the water of life and the tree of life. The river is for beverage, and the tree is for food, for life supply. One is for quenching, and the other is for nourishing.<h2 class=head2>B. As the Center of Its Divine Glory</h2><p>Such a throne with its administration and its fellowship is the center of the New Jerusalem&#8217;s divine glory.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> </body></html>
