   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE THE ACCOMPLISHMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF WATCHMAN NEE'S MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In spite of the fact that he was despised, criticized, misunderstood, opposed, and rejected by the denominations, Watchman Nee's ministry still accomplished a number of things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His ministry made clear the matter of salvation by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It aroused believers both in and out of the recovery to love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It stirred up Christians to seek the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It ushered the seeking ones into spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It brought the Lord's people into identification with Christ in His death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It established the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And it ushered in and built up a ministry of supply.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Let us consider each of these matters in turn.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>MAKING CLEAR THE MATTER OF SALVATION BY GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since the time the gospel began to be preached in China, although it was enthusiastically and widely declared, salvation by grace never became adequately clear to the Chinese Christians until Watchman Nee's ministry was raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first step in his ministry was to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As he began to preach the gospel, he discovered the need of some clear teaching concerning assurance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Along with his preaching of the gospel, he incorporated the clear word of the Bible concerning the assurance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the twelve years between 1922 and 1934, through his labor this matter was made clear to the Chinese Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the fall of 1933 I was invited to preach in a chapel of a Presbyterian hospital in the city of Soochow, Kiangsu.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>While telling the audience that they could know assuredly that they were saved according to the Bible, I noticed the pastor shaking his head, indicating that he did not agree.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This incident depicted the ignorant situation of so many Christians concerning the matter of salvation in China at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since 1934, however, up to this present moment, the two matters of salvation by grace and the assurance of salvation have become crystal clear to the Christians in the Far East, and it has become popular to preach these truths in all the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>AROUSING BELIEVERS TO LOVE THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Through Watchman Nee's spoken and written ministry, many Christians were set on fire to love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This became a tide flooding over not only the unbelievers but also hundreds of Christians of different ages throughout China.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Wherever his ministry went, it brought in a revival of seeking the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This matter was neither superficial in its depth, nor did it mushroom overnight.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It happened as slowly and solidly as a seed sown into the depths of many seekers and lovers of the Lord, causing them to be attached to Him and making them grow in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One brother in Shanghai testified that when he first heard Watchman speak, even when the Lord's name was mentioned, it was so sweet to him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Just a short prayer by Watchman in the Lord's name caught him for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Watchman Nee as a person and his ministry as the Lord's supply became a great magnet attracting people to follow him in loving the Lord with their whole heart.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Through his ministry, people were not moved toward the Lord in a way of enthusiasm; rather, deep in their being, his ministry caused others to deeply touch the Lord in love.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many who came in contact with his ministry were fully captivated and captured by the Lord and led to consecrate themselves fully to Him for His move on this earth.</S>
