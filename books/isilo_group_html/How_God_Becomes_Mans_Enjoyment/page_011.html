<h1 class="title">THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 14; 4:24; 6:63; 16:7, 13-15; 20:19-22</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h2>
<p>The content of the Gospel of John can be considered as an amplified explanation of Genesis 2:8-10. In these verses God put man in the garden of Eden. In the middle of the garden there were the tree of life and the river of water of life for man to enjoy. The tree of life denotes Christ, and the river denotes the Spirit. The Gospel of John also speaks of God as a tree and as a river in order to be man&rsquo;s life and enjoyment. The Lord is a vine tree (15:1), and the Spirit is a river (7:38-39). Therefore, the Gospel of John is concerning God in Christ as the Spirit to be our life and life supply. The chorus of <em>Hymns,</em> #509 says, &ldquo;God is in Christ to be my supply, / God as the Spirit nourisheth me; / If upon Christ in spirit I feed, / Filled with His life I&rsquo;ll be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Gospel of John begins with the Word and ends with the Spirit. Verse 1 of chapter 1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; In verse 22 of chapter 20 the Lord breathed into His disciples and said to them, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; In the beginning of this Gospel God is the eternal Word. At the end of this Gospel God is the Spirit who was breathed into man and received by man. God is both the Word and the Spirit. In verse 63 of chapter 6 the Lord said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit.&rdquo; This shows the relationship between the Word and the Spirit; the Lord&rsquo;s words are spirit. God wants to give Himself to us for our enjoyment not only in Christ but also in the Spirit and in the Word.</p>
<p>How can we eat and drink God? How can we touch God? In order to give me a loaf of bread, you would simply need to hand it to me, and I would take it. That is quite easy. But how can we give God to others? We cannot show them the Lord Jesus, because He is not visible. In order for people to understand and to know the Lord Jesus, they need the Word. We can know the Lord Jesus through the Word, which is the gospel. He is also the Word who became flesh (1:14), and all that He is and has done are now in the Word. His person and His work, including how He was crucified, shed His blood, was buried, resurrected, and ascended, and all that He has obtained and attained are in the Word.</p>
<p>The Lord is also the Spirit. In Himself He is the Spirit and then the Word, but in our experience He is the Word and then the Spirit. The Word explains and reveals Him to us so that we may understand and know Him. The Spirit accomplishes within us what the Word has revealed and explained so that we may not only understand and know Him but also receive and enjoy Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD OF GOD BEING THE FOOD OF LIFE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Man Needing to Live on the Word of God</h2>
<p>The Word of God is our spiritual life supply. Matthew 4:4 says, &ldquo;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God.&rdquo; This is a quotation of Deuteronomy 8:3. God&rsquo;s words are more important than food. A man who lives only on physical food, not on God&rsquo;s Word, will not fulfill God&rsquo;s desire. It is not enough for a person to live on food; he must also live on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God. A proper person cannot live only on physical food; he must also feed on God&rsquo;s word. There is a great difference between those who feed on God&rsquo;s word and those who do not. Most people care for eating only the physical food. They neglect God&rsquo;s word, because they do not know that God&rsquo;s word is the food that man needs. The Lord Jesus&rsquo; words in Matthew 4:4 show that God&rsquo;s word is bread, our food.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus fasted for forty days, but He lived on the word of God (v. 2). He did not eat anything else. As a result, when the devil tempted Him to turn stones into loaves of bread in order to satisfy His hunger, He said, &ldquo;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God.&rdquo; This verse indicates that the Lord did not need food in order to live. He needed every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God.</p>
<p>When we are filled with the Lord&rsquo;s word, our spiritual sicknesses disappear. When we do not eat enough of His word and are spiritually malnourished, our sicknesses and problems return. As Christians, our problems are due to a lack of feeding on the word and being supplied by the word. When we eat and are filled with God&rsquo;s word, our problems are eliminated.</p>
<p>I can testify that when I am heavily burdened with problems or troubling matters and I eat God&rsquo;s word, the heavy burdens are lightened, the problems disappear, and I am comforted. It is often not enough for us to merely pray when we face problems; we must also eat God&rsquo;s word. If we would spend half an hour or more to eat and be filled with the word, we would be strengthened within, and our problems would be resolved. May we learn to eat the word. God is embodied in the word. When we eat Him, He will supply our needs. We should always remember that man cannot live on bread alone but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>How God Becomes Man's Enjoyment &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
