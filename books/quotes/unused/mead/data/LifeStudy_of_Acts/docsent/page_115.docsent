   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>All the Aspects of What Christ Is</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What are these holy and trustworthy things?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They are all the aspects of what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the New Testament, Christ is life, light, grace, righteousness, holiness, sanctification, and justification.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is also the bread of life and the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Furthermore, the holy and trustworthy things include all the aspects of Christ unveiled in 1 Corinthians: power, wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, redemption, glory, the depths of God, the unique foundation of God s building, the Passover, the unleavened bread, the spiritual food, the spiritual drink, the spiritual rock, the Head, the Body, the firstfruit, the second Man, and the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We see many more aspects of Christ in the Gospel of John, such as the Shepherd and the pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Oh, how much Christ is to us as the holy and trustworthy things!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As the resurrected One, He is the firstborn Son, the Savior, and all the holy and trustworthy things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ as Mercies to Us</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Old Testament the holy and faithful things are regarded as mercies.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Isaiah 55:3 speaks of the sure mercies of David.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Second Chronicles 6:42 mentions the mercies of David, the Lord s servant, and Psalm 89:1 says, I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do you know what mercy is?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Mercy implies both love and grace, but it reaches further than love.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Where love and grace cannot reach, mercy can reach.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All the holy and faithful things are Christ Himself as mercies to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Life is a mercy, and light is also a mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Likewise, righteousness, holiness, justification, and sanctification are mercies.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In chapter ten of the Gospel of John we have the door, the pasture, and the Shepherd, all of which are mercies.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Try to count all the aspects of these mercies.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you took the time to count them, you would have a long list of mercies.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A husband s love for his wife and the wife s submission to her husband are Christ as mercies to us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If, in Christ, I love my wife, this surely is a mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>My love for her is Christ Himself as a mercy to me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In a similar way, if a sister, in Christ, submits to her husband, that also is a mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Her submission is Christ Himself as a mercy to her.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I can testify that my speaking the word of God year after year is certainly a mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What a mercy that I can speak the word inexhaustibly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the past I spent a few months every year in the Philippines ministering the word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>An elderly sister, who was my hostess, was greatly surprised that I always had something new to say.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>She thought that after some years I would have nothing further to minister.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One day after a conference meeting, she said, I thought that by now you would be exhausted and have nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But your ministry is even fresher and richer now than before.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Where do you get all these things to speak?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If I were asked this question today, I would say that my speaking the word is Christ as a mercy to me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is not a matter of my ability or gift.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is altogether a matter of mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Not only is it a mercy for me to speak the word of God, but even the dear Savior is my speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>My speaking is Christ, and to me this speaking Christ is a mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I do not have an advanced degree, and my speaking is not eloquent.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Nevertheless, this speaking is full of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is wholly due to Christ being a mercy to me in speaking the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Christ Preached by Paul</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We all need to see that the resurrected Christ is the firstborn Son of God, the Savior, and holy and faithful things of David.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All genuine Christians know that Christ is the only begotten Son of God, and some may realize that He is the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But have you ever heard that the resurrected Christ is all the holy and trustworthy things as mercies given to us by God as an all-inclusive gift?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We may have never heard of this, but this was the Christ preached by Paul in Acts 13.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I am very happy to see that Paul, in his gospel message, not only preached Christ from the Old Testament, but also preached the resurrected Christ as the holy and trustworthy things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Actually, what Paul proclaimed here in his preaching of the gospel requires all the Epistles written by him for its definition.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, if you want to see more concerning Christ as the holy and trustworthy things, you need to study the fourteen Epistles of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In his preaching Paul set up an excellent pattern for us to follow in our gospel preaching today.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Like Paul, we need to preach Christ in a rich and uplifted way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In 13:35 through 37 Paul continues, Wherefore He says also in another psalm, You will not allow Your Holy One to see corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For David indeed, when he had served his own generation by the counsel of God, fell asleep and was buried with his fathers and saw corruption; but He whom God raised did not see corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The word served in verse 36 indicates that David s reigning as a king was a service to his generation by the counsel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Literally, the Greek word translated buried means added to.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As in Acts 13:30, Paul again in verse 37 emphasizes the fact that God raised up the Man Jesus.</S>
