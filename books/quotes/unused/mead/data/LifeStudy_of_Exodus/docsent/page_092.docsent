   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE TWENTY-SEVEN ISRAEL S EXODUS FROM EGYPT 2 Scripture Reading: Exo 12:14, 37; 13:1-22; Gen 50:24-25; Heb 11:22; Josh 24:32; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>37:1, 10</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall continue to consider the exodus of God s people from Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the previous message we saw that Pharaoh and the Egyptians were subdued by God; then they drove the children of Israel out of Egypt 12:29-33; 11:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The children of Israel had no time to leaven their bread 12:34, 39 , but, according to God s commandment, they plundered the Egyptians of their silver, gold, and raiment 12:35-36; 3:21-22; 11:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Furthermore, we saw that the children of Israel came forth from Egypt with their children and their flocks and herds 12:37-38, 31-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Their dwelling in the Gentile land had lasted for a period of four hundred thirty years 12:40-41 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The night of their exodus was a night of observation 12:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Finally, when they made their exodus from Egypt, the children of Israel had become the armies of the Lord 12:41, 51 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, in the words of 13:18, they came out of Egypt in martial array.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this message we shall cover four additional points, all found in chapter thirteen.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In contrast to the material covered in the foregoing message, these points are related to spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It may seem that chapter thirteen is an insertion between chapters twelve and fourteen and that chapter fourteen should be the direct continuation of chapter twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In a sense, this may be correct.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, from the standpoint of spiritual experience, chapter thirteen is not an insertion; it is a definite continuation of chapter twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All the points in chapter thirteen relate to spiritual experience on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, 13:2 speaks of the sanctification of the firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Certainly this signifies a particular aspect of the spiritual experience of God s people in coming out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It indicates that the purpose of our exodus from the world is to be sanctified to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 13:3-10 we read of a day of memorial held in the month of Abib.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At the time of this memorial, the children of Israel were not to eat leavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The day the children of Israel came out from Egypt was to be a day of unleavened bread and a day of memorial.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to 13:3, it was the eating of unleavened bread that was the memorial, the remembrance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The way to remember the exodus was to purge out all leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, there are three things that go together: the day of remembrance, the unleavened bread, and the month of Abib.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 13:19 we read that Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for Joseph had charged the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is significant that this detail is not mentioned either in chapter twelve or in chapter fourteen, but immediately after a verse that tells us how God led the people through the way of the wilderness v. 18 . As we shall see, God led them in a way contrary to what we would expect according to the natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We would expect Him to take the short way, but instead He took a roundabout way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Furthermore, in the verses immediately following the record concerning Joseph s bones, we are told that the Lord went before the children of Israel by day in a pillar of cloud and by night in a pillar of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, as we consider this chapter in the light of spiritual experience, we need to put together the matter of Joseph s bones with the way of God s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Viewing this chapter as a whole, we see that it begins with sanctification and ends with the Lord s presence as the guide for His people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Let us now look at this wonderful chapter in detail.</S>
