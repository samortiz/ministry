   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not Loving Our Own Soul-life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have spoken of the basis of overcoming, but what is the experience of the overcomers themselves?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They face trials and encounter many difficulties, yet Revelation 12:11 says, "They loved not their soul-life even unto death."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the attitude of the overcomers in the warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this verse the word "life" has two meanings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One denotes the physical life, while the other refers to the power of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The word "life" can be translated as "soul-life."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Let us consider the power of the soul or the natural ability.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The best way for Satan to deal with us is to cause us to act in our own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Satan wants us to move in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He wants us to exercise our own natural ability and fleshly energy in our work for God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What is natural ability?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Natural ability is the ability which we originally had and which has never been dealt with by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It accompanies our character.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The natural ability of one person may be his cleverness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In whatever he does, he draws upon his own cleverness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The natural ability of another may be his eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He can speak well independent of any special power from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Man, however, cannot serve God with the natural ability that has never been dealt with by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The failure of the church is due to man bringing in his natural ability.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Oh, we all must be brought by God to the place where we are trembling and fearful lest we do anything without the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must become such persons not merely speaking such things, but actually being such persons.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then we will become useful in the hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are not encouraging anyone to pretend that he is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is of no use, because it does not come from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are saying that God wants to break everything that is natural in a man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only when we are cut off from all the elements that originate from our self will Christ be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must allow God to cancel the self through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One day we must let God break the backbone of our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not try to deal with this matter, piece by piece, item by item.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For us to deal only with the outward things and leave the inward, natural life untouched is not only useless, but, on the contrary, it will make us proud.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We will consider ourselves to be quite satisfactory, yet our inward condition will be even more difficult to deal with.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The day must come when our strength to do good and our ability to serve God are broken.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then we will confess before God and man that we can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Henceforth, Christ will be able to manifest His power upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We all must be brought by God to the place where we see that we can do nothing in the church with our natural strength.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many people think that as long as their motive is correct, it is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But this is not the case.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When you say you are working, the Lord will ask, "By what are you working?"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you say that you are zealous, the Lord will ask, "From where does your zeal come?"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you say that you have power, the Lord will ask, "What is the source of your power?"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The question is not what you are doing, but with what you are doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The problem is not whether or not the matter is good, but what is the source of the goodness.</S>
