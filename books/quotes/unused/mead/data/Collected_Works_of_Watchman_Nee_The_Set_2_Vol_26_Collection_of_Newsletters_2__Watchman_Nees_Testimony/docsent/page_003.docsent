   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>10 September October 1934 A MESSAGE FROM BROTHER LAN CHIH YI</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To my brother in the Lord, Mr. Watchman:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I returned to Hankow after the end of the Third Overcomer Conference and was dealt with deeply by God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Through the Lord's enlightenment I easily saw that my position in the orphanage was not according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although I am able to work freely there, I have lost the strength to fight in the matter of testifying for the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The work in Wuchang and Hankow has not begun, because I have hindered God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>My soul magnifies the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The teachings in 2 Corinthians 6:14 and 17 persuaded me even more strongly into obeying.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I dared not procrastinate any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I handed in my letter of resignation on April 11.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Who could have expected that once I handed in my resignation, the hindrances would come?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There has been the attack of Satan, the entanglement of emotions, the refusal of my superiors to release me, and their determination to keep me; I am still struggling to put them aside at this date.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The road before me is even darker.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But I deeply believe that the waters of the Jordan will part.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The eye of faith sees the glory on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I plan to send in another letter of resignation sooner or later.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Please pray for this matter, asking God to eliminate every hindrance so that I can walk in His God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Jesus Christ is Victor!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I heard that you will not go out in the summer but will study Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Is this true?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Please let me know.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the Lord is willing, I will go to Shanghai during that time to be edified.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I have had a question for a long time that has never been answered.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I brought it up at the end of this last Overcomer Conference.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Unfortunately, it was not answered at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>My question is, "Can those with old debts such as those who have gone bankrupt in business work solely for God as a preacher referring to a called one with a gift ?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Please write me a letter in response.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I am praying for it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I send my solemn and respectful greetings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Peace in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Your little brother,</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Lan Chih Yi</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>June 12, 1934</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A LETTER FROM BROTHER YANG LI JEN</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>OF P'ING YANG, CHEKIANG PROVINCE</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Peace to Brother David Hsu: Jude 20-21; James 5:7-8</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I do not know whether or not you were able to receive the letter I sent you a few days ago.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>While I was thinking about you quite a bit, I read Collection of Newsletters.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In it was a letter you sent to your friend Tsai Ch'ing, so I know that you have moved back to Ningpo.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thank the Lord for His grace in initiating through the brothers Collection of Newsletters so that we can obtain a different kind of fellowship in Him with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Through it we also learn about the work raised up in each locality and the news of the individual brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This endeavor is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But we should also be wary of two things: 1 a kind of special fellowship that comes from the flesh and easily becomes one of the elements of a denomination there has been the initiation of letters of recommendation ; and 2 the abominable works of the flesh which might be mixed in if they have not been thoroughly dealt with by the cross; they "steal glory from God."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Presently, everything is very good, but in the not so distant future, I am afraid that it will lose its original meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Brother, allow me to say a few direct words of sorrow: If a person is not completely of the spirit and controlled by the spirit, his fallen flesh and the fruit of his fallen flesh denominations and stealing glory from God will never be completely eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>O Lord, You know our corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>May You search out everything and gain everything.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>May You also come quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I wonder what you think about this, brother.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You said, "We are busy...as if the master is returning quickly and the slaves are busily preparing,' and our hearts are truly like this."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You also said, "In ourselves, we could pass through in comfortable rest, but our business now is because of Him the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This word really made me happy!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Truly, our heart is like that of a servant; truly, we could rest comfortably in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, everything that we have or do must be because of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the last letter I sent you, there were a few matters to ask you to pray for.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Thank the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I already know about your recent situation, so I have plenty of material to pray for when praying for you.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Material does not seem to be such an appropriate word.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I ask that you pray to the Lord that my prayer life would grow and improve.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The news from P'ing Yang published in the sixth issue of Collection of Newsletters mentioned Sister Lin Chih Ming in the tenth meeting place.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>She has temporarily fallen because of her husband, and she does not come out any longer to meet or break bread with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, Brother Su Chih San is much stronger than before and sometimes comes to the table meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The persecution these two are under is very heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>May the Lord grace them with strength and be magnified in them.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Please pray for them!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>How has your health been recently?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What is the condition of the meeting in your locality?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Please write and tell me.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>"The Lord be with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Grace be with you."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The last verse of 2 Timothy 4.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Respectfully from your weak little brother,</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Yang Li Jen</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>February 12</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Note from Watchman: We should certainly pay attention to the two points that Brother Yang mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>However, I would like to clarify the first point: If our fellowship is not larger or smaller than what God has commanded, we will never be a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I am afraid that many brothers have only seen the error of denominations but have not seen the connection of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Even though everything has failed today, we should still act according to the principle of one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Those who do not understand will think that we have a special fellowship because we still want to keep the principle of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Those who have left the denominations are standing in the position of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>They are not a disorganized mob.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We definitely should not misunderstand and think that we must be a scattered rabble before we will not have denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>A scattered rabble may not be a denomination, but it is definitely not the Body, nor does it have the principle of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The book The Assembly Life will be published soon.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The chapter "The Practice of Fellowship" is most crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I am afraid that the brothers might misunderstand after reading Brother Yang's letter, so I feel to especially add these few words.</S>
