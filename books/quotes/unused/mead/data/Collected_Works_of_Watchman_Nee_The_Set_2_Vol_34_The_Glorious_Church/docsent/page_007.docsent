   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Hebrews 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Genesis 1 speaks of the will of God at creation, Psalm 8 speaks of God's will after man's fall, and Hebrews 2 speaks of God's will in redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us look at Hebrews 2.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We will see that in the victory of redemption God still desires man to obtain authority and deal with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In verses 5 through 8a the writer says, "For it was not to angels that He subjected the coming inhabited earth, concerning which we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But one has solemnly testified somewhere, saying, What is man, that You bring him to mind?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Or the son of man, that You care for him?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You have made Him a little inferior to the angels; You have crowned Him with glory and honor and have set Him over the works of Your hands; You have subjected all things under His feet quoted from Psalm 8 .'</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For in subjecting all things to Him, He left nothing unsubject to Him."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All things must be subject to man; God purposed it from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But it has not yet turned out in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The writer continues, "But now we do not yet see all things subjected to Him, but we see Jesus, who was made a little inferior to the angels because of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>8b-9a .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Jesus is the person who fits this situation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Psalm 8 said that God made man a little lower than the angels, but the apostle changed the word "man" into "Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He explained that "man" refers to Jesus; it was Jesus who became a little lower than the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Man's redemption is by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God originally purposed that man should be a little lower than the angels and that man should be crowned and rule over all His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He intended for man to exercise authority on His behalf to cast out His enemy from the earth and from the heaven related to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He wanted man to destroy all of Satan's power.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But man fell and did not take his place to rule.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, the Lord Jesus came and took upon Him a body of flesh and blood.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He became the "last Adam" 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The last part of verse 9 says, "So that by the grace of God He might taste death on behalf of everything."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The birth of the Lord Jesus, the human living of the Lord Jesus, as well as the redemption of the Lord Jesus show us that His redemptive work is not only for man, but for all created things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All creation except the angels is included.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord Jesus stood in two positions: to God He was the man at the beginning, the man whom God appointed from the very first, and to man He is the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the beginning God assigned man to rule and overthrow Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord Jesus is that man, and that man is now enthroned!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Such a man has overthrown the power of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is the man whom God is after and desires to obtain.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In His other aspect, He is a man related to us; He is our Savior, the One who has dealt with the problem of sin in our place.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We sinned and fell, and God made Him to be the propitiation for us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, He not only became the propitiation for us, but He was also judged for all creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is proved by the splitting of the veil in the holy place.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hebrews 10 tells us that the veil in the holy place signified the body of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Upon the veil were embroidered cherubim, which represent created things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At the time of the Lord's death, the veil was split in two from the top to the bottom; as a result, the cherubim embroidered upon it were simultaneously rent.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This reveals that the death of the Lord Jesus included judgment for all creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He not only tasted death for every man, but also for "everything."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 10 continues, "For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and through whom are all things, in leading many sons into glory."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All things are for Him and through Him; all things are to Him and by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To be for Him means to be to Him; to be through Him means to be by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Praise God, He has not changed His purpose in creation!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What God ordained at creation He continued to ordain after man's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In redemption His purpose remains the same.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God did not change His purpose because of man's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Praise God, He is bringing many sons into glory!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He is glorifying many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God purposed to gain a group of new men who have the likeness and the image of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Since the Lord Jesus is the representative man, the rest will be like whatever He is, and they will enter with Him into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>How is this to be accomplished?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Verse 11 says, "For both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of One."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Who is He that sanctifies?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Who are those that are being sanctified?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We are the ones.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We can read the verse in this way: "For both Jesus who sanctifies and we who are sanctified are all of One."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord Jesus and we are all begotten of the same Father; we have all originated from the same source and have the same life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have the same indwelling Spirit and the same God, who is our Lord and our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>"For which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The word "He" refers to our Lord Jesus, and "them" to us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>"He is not ashamed to call them brothers" because He is of the Father and we also are of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We are God's many sons, which will ultimately result in God bringing us into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Redemption did not change God's purpose; on the contrary, it fulfilled the purpose that was not accomplished in creation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God's original purpose was that man should rule, especially over the earth, but man regrettably failed.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Yet all things did not come to an end because of the first man's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What God did not obtain from the first man, Adam, He will obtain from the second man, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There was the eventful birth in Bethlehem because God ordained man to rule and restore the earth and because God determined that the creature man should destroy the creature Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is why the Lord Jesus came to become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He did it purposely, and He became a true man.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The first man did not accomplish God's purpose; rather, he sinned and fell.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He not only failed to restore the earth, but he was captured by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He not only failed to rule, but he was brought into subjection to Satan's power.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Genesis 2 says that man was made of dust, and Genesis 3 points out that dust was the food of the serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This means that fallen man became the food of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Man could no longer deal with Satan; he was finished.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>What could be done?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Did this mean that God could never achieve His eternal purpose, that He could no longer obtain what He was after?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Did it mean that God could never restore the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He sent His Son to become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The Lord Jesus is truly God, but He is also truly man.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In the whole world there is at least one man who chooses God, a person who can say, "The ruler of the world is coming, and in Me he has nothing" John 14:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In other words, in the Lord Jesus there is not a trace of the prince of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We must note carefully that the Lord Jesus came to this world not to be God but to be man.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>God required a man.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If God Himself dealt with Satan, it would be very easy; Satan would fall in a moment.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>But God would not do it Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He wanted man to deal with Satan; He intended that the creature would deal with the creature.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>When the Lord Jesus became a man, He suffered temptation as a man and passed through all the experiences of man.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This man conquered; this man was victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>He ascended to heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Jesus has been "crowned with glory and honor" Heb 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>He has been glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>He did not come to receive glory as God, but to obtain glory as man.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We do not mean that He did not have the glory of God, but Hebrews 2 does not refer to the glory which He possessed as God.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>It refers to Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels because of the suffering of death; Jesus was crowned with glory and honor.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Our Lord ascended as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Today He is in the heavens as man.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>A man is at God's right hand.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>In the future there will be many men who will be there.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Today a man is sitting on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>One day there will be many men sitting on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This is certain.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>When the Lord Jesus was resurrected, He imparted His life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>When we believe in Him, we receive His life.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We all become God's sons, and as such, we all belong to God.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Because we have this life within us, as men we can be entrusted by God to fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Therefore, it says that He will bring many sons into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>To rule is to be glorified, and to be glorified is to rule.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>When the many sons have obtained authority and restored the earth, then they will be brought triumphantly into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>We should never presume that God's purpose is merely to save us from hell that we may enjoy the blessings of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>We must remember that God intends for man to follow His Son in the exercise of His authority on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>God wants to accomplish something, but He will not do it Himself; He wants us to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>When we have done it, then God will have attained His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>God desires to obtain a group of men who will do His work here on this earth, that God may rule on earth through man.</S>
