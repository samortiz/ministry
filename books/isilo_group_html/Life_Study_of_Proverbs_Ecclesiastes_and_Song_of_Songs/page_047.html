<H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE TWO</H1>

<H1 CLASS=TITLE>VANITY OF VANITIES</H1>

<H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1>

<H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eccl. 12:13-14</H1>

<P>In this message we will continue to consider the writer's experiments and then go on to see his searching and testing.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. In Contacting God</H2>

<P>Ecclesiastes 5:1-7 describes the writer's experiment in contacting God.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. In the View of Caution</H2>

<P>Solomon's word here is not in the view of encouragement but in the view of caution. This is different from the view of the apostle Paul in encouraging the believers to approach God for receiving mercy and finding grace for timely help (Heb. 4:16).</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Guarding Our Steps<br>
When We Go to the House of God</H2>

<P>Ecclesiastes 5:1a cautions us to guard our steps when we go to the house of God.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Drawing Near to Listen</H2>

<P>Verse 1b charges us to draw near to listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools, who do not know that they are doing evil.</P>

<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. Not Being Rash with Our Mouth</H2>

<P>We should not be rash with our mouth and not let our heart hastily utter anything before God, for God is in heaven and we are on the earth. Therefore, we should let our words be few, unlike the fool's multitude of words (vv. 2-3).</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_046.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_048.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes and Song of Songs &nbsp; pg 47</div><br></body></html>
