   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>What does it mean for a Christian to have the Holy Spirit as the seal?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is a seal?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are over three million people in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How does God know who belongs to Him and who does not?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you bring me a Bible today, how do I know that it is yours?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There are countless Bibles like yours.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Bible Society recently published a report saying that it sold over eleven million Bibles last year.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Among all those Bibles, how do you know which one is yours?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When you go home and put a seal on your Bible you know that it is yours.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even if you were to mix this Bible with all the Bibles in the world, you could still identify it as yours.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today, because there are so many people in the world, how do you know who belongs to God and who does not?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God has put a seal on you, proving that you belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God did not seal you on your forehead with a large wooden chop.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is not like the coming Antichrist, who will place a mark on man's forehead.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God put the Holy Spirit in you as a seal.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All those who have the Holy Spirit belong to God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All those who do not have the Holy Spirit do not belong to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At the time a person is saved, God does a sealing work on him and puts the Holy Spirit within him to prove that he is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the seal of the Holy Spirit in us can be erased, then it is possible for us to perish; we may be considered as not belonging to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may be considered as typical people in the world or even as God's enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But if this seal is within us, then we belong to God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How long will the seal of God be in us?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The last part of Ephesians 4:30 says, "In whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"Whom" refers to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The previous clause says, "And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This seal will last unto the day of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How long does the Bible say that we will have the seal of the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We will not have it for merely three or five years, or for three or five hundred years, but until the day of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What is the day of redemption?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Romans 8 says that the day of redemption is the day when the Lord Jesus will come back.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The day of redemption is the day when our bodies will be redeemed v. 23 . Hence, this denotes the day when the Lord Jesus comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The seal of the Holy Spirit remains in us until the coming again of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the Lord Jesus comes again not the time of the first rapture at the beginning of the tribulation, but at the time that the whole Body will be raptured , all the believers will be taken up into the air.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord Jesus will send the angels to come and gather these believers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The angels are limited.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They are not omniscient; they do not know everything.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The angels are the servants sent out to invite the guests.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When these angels see all those with the seal of the Holy Spirit, they will gather them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, the Holy Spirit is not in us for three or five days, or for three or five hundred days, but in us until the day of rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today if a man says that he can lose his salvation and perish, then I will ask him what he will do with the seal of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since God has said that we have been sealed by Him, there is nothing we can do to remove this seal.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God has said that this seal will remain until the day of Jesus Christ and the day of rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In John 14 the Lord Jesus said that the Holy Spirit will be with us forever v. 16 . Once the Holy Spirit of the New Testament comes into us, He will never leave us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Never believe in the diagram that some Christians display, which depicts a man with a heart full of snakes, pigs, dogs, and many other animals.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Next to the heart is a dove representing the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When a person's heart is clean, the Holy Spirit supposedly will come into him and stay there, and all the other animals will depart.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But if his heart is not clean, the dove will fly away, and all the other things will come in. This is absolutely wrong! The Holy Spirit can never fly away.</S>
