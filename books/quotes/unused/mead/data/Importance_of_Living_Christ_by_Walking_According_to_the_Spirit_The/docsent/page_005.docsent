   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>LIVING IN THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>SO THAT THEY MAY LIVE HIM 1 Scripture Reading: Rom 8:4-16; John 15:4; Gal 2:20</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Romans 8:4-16 says,</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For those who are according to the flesh mind the things of the flesh; but those who are according to the spirit, the things of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because the mind set on the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, for neither can it be.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And those who are in the flesh cannot please God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yet if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the spirit is life because of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And if the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>So then, brothers, we are debtors not to the flesh to live according to the flesh; for if you live according to the flesh, you must die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For you have not received a spirit of slavery bringing you into fear again, but you have received a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE FOCUS OF THE BIBLE BEING</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE TRIUNE GOD LIVING IN THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>SO THAT THEY MAY LIVE HIM</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to set aside what we think we know about Romans 8 and approach it as a new chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to consider what the focus in these verses is.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Through the years many Christian teachers, such as Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis, have written concerning Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to my knowledge, almost none of their writings touch the focus of verses 4 through 16.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many writers see that chapter 7 concerns the flesh, and chapter 8 concerns the spirit, which is in contrast with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is right, but the spirit is not the focus of these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Actually, the focus of these verses is the focus of the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Understanding the central teaching of the Bible has been a problem for centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul completed the divine revelation, and John mended, confirmed, and strengthened it more than nineteen centuries ago.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Since then Christians have found many crucial points in the Bible, but the true focus has been almost entirely missed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord said, Abide in Me and I in you John 15:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The apostle Paul wrote, It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The focus of the entire Bible can be seen in these simple words.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need to see the fact that the Triune God lives in each of us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This fact should be not only a doctrine, revelation, or vision but also our daily experience.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because the Triune God lives in us, we can live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This needs to be our daily experience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, the focus and central teaching of the Bible is that the Triune God desires to live in His redeemed and regenerated people so that they may live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This simple expression annuls all philosophy and religion.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The thought that God wants to live in us so that we may live Him is like fine flour, and all the other thoughts are like leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Activities such as preaching the gospel and establishing churches should be the issues of our living the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, we mainly need to see that the focus of Romans 8 and of the Bible is nothing other than God s desire to live in us so that we may live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>UNDERSTANDING THE BIBLE WITH A NEW CONCEPT</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although the utterance God wants to live in us so that we may live Him is not found in Romans 8, it is the central concept of this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to verse 9, God indwells us as the Spirit in order to make His home in us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The goal of God being the Spirit and the Spirit indwelling us is God living in us so that we may live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In other words, the Bible teaches us that God wants to be one with us in life and living He lives in us, and we live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The thought that God wants to live in us so that we may live Him may seem strange to us, even if we have studied the Bible, because this thought is new to our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We understand anything that we read mainly according to our preexisting vocabulary and concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For instance, because wives are often concerned with whether their husbands love them, when they read Ephesians 5, they may mainly notice verse 25, which says, Husbands, love your wives.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, husbands may focus on verse 22, which says, Wives, be subject to your own husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These different understandings of the same chapter are based on the thoughts already occupying the minds of husbands and wives.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Often when we read the Bible, we do not receive revelation but instead insert the thoughts and occupations of the self into our understanding of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Once the thought enters into our mind that God wants to live in us so that we may live Him, we will be able to see and apply this focus in every portion of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For instance, we can apply this focus to Ephesians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A husband is able to love his wife because God, who is love, lives in him and becomes his love as he lives God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thus, a husband s love for his wife should be not his own ethical virtue but the issue of God living in him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Similarly, a wife s submission should not be merely an ethical virtue but the issue of God living in her and her living God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We can apply this focus to every virtue mentioned in the Bible, such as humility, kindness, long-suffering, and forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>These should not be ethical virtues like those taught by Confucius but the expression and issue of God living in us and our living Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Most Christian teachers have made the virtues in the Bible into ethical teachings because they have missed the focus of the Bible, which is that the Triune God, after passing through His processes and accomplishing everything necessary for the fulfilling of His eternal purpose, became the Spirit in order to enter into man and live in man so that man may live Him.</S>
