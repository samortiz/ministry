We give up the world, but not because of outward coercion. We are not like the people in the world who become poor after their material goods are confiscated; we voluntarily free ourselves from the bondage of material things. Tomorrow night I hope you will prepare a list and bring the pocket money your parents have allotted to you. Find the minimum amount that you need to spend, then hand over the rest. I hope everyone will be faithful to do what they should.</p><p>There are twenty-seven to twenty-eight assemblies in northern Kiangsu. During the past eight months, none of the brothers and sisters there had the chance to even get a bowl of rice. The more fortunate ones ate bean cakes, while the less fortunate ones ate grass and tree bark. Since I know the situation in all the places, I feel grieved and even angry when I see some brothers and sisters caring only for themselves and having no thought of saving. Please forgive me for saying this. In Hong Kong bean cakes are sold to Taiwan for fertilizer, but in northern Kiangsu only the most well off can afford to eat bean cakes. I do not know how you can eat your rice in peace when you hear this. This situation is happening not only in northern Kiangsu. In one or two months, more than half of the brothers and sisters in the church in Nanking will have nothing to eat.</p><p>I pray that God will free us from all kinds of considerations over so many things. I pray that we will only hand ourselves over. We should let other brothers remember our own needs. Paul told the churches in Asia who had supplied the lack of other churches that these churches eventually would fill up their lack as well (2 Cor. 8:14). The brothers and sisters never imagined that they would face what they are facing today. In the same way, we never know what we will face tomorrow. I hope that we will remember them as brothers. I hope that we will hand ourselves over to fill up their lack. Before you handed yourselves over, I spoke with reservation. But now that you have handed yourselves over, I do not have any reservation; I am not afraid of suspicion.</p><p>Some of you may have the thought of helping these ones, but think that you have too little. Please do not calculate what you can do, because you are not the only one who has handed yourself over. When you hand yourself over, you are not doing it to please man, but to please the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">In the Principle of Coordination</h2><p>Today God is taking the way of the church. Everything should be done in the principle of coordination. My heart rejoices to see that, under God's grace, we can coordinate together, not only in preaching the gospel but in offering up our money and time. We should not choose our field of study carelessly as we did before. Rather, we should choose subjects that are related to businesses that the saints have and concentrate on these professions. In the coming days, these professions will afford us an unfettered occupation to support ourselves. After three or five years, many brothers and sisters will be prepared to be sent to other places in China for the gospel. First, we should gospelize the strategic places, and then we should move out to the surrounding towns and villages. How different is this kind of preaching from the individual preaching of one or two persons that we experienced in the past!</p><p>Presently, there are over five hundred assemblies in China. We have close to seventy thousand brothers and sisters. If we pool our efforts together for the gospel enterprise, instead of working independently here and there, this will create a great impact! In the past our co-workers did not like to work in coordination. Now they have to learn the lesson of coordination. They should take the lead in this matter, but this work does not belong to the co-workers alone; everyone has a part in it. We should not think that we only have to offer a little money or material goods. This work is the responsibility of all of us. If the Lord is gracious to us, I hope that many brothers will rise up, including older ones, and forsake everything to serve in coordination in the church.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_059.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_061.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 61: Matured Leadings in the Lord's Recovery (1) &nbsp; pg 60</div><br></body></html>
