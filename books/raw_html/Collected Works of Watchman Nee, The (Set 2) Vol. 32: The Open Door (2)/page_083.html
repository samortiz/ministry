<h2 class="head2">Manila, Philippines</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Brothers and sisters who are called by the Lord in every place:</p><p>May the grace and peace of the Lord be multiplied to you, amen. There are many denominations in the Philippines, and the complexity of them is no different than that of other places. Over ninety percent of the Filipinos are Catholic. Although they know about Jesus, they do not understand the truth of the redemption of the cross and the blood. This is indeed sad! A few years ago the Lord's servant, Leland Wang, came to the Philippines and preached the redemption of the cross. Not long after, the Lord sent Brother Simon Meek to come and continue with the shepherding work. Although the brothers and sisters here are spiritually immature, our Lord, who is the Author and Finisher, has been working silently to accomplish His plan step by step. Two years ago Brother Watchman Nee was going to England, and the Lord led him to pass through here. During that brief period, he expounded the truth of the church a little in addition to releasing the truth of overcoming. All the seeking brothers and sisters received much help from this. Later, because of the saints' spiritual hunger and because of the need of the work which necessitates Brother Meek's going out for evangelization work, the brothers were in one accord to ask the Lord to send a servant to work in our midst. After praying, we sent a letter of invitation to Chuenchow to ask Brother Wu Ren-jieh to come. After he received the letter and after waiting before the Lord for a long time, he arrived in the Philippines in September.</p><p>After Brother Wu arrived in the Philippines, the Lord gave him the opportunity to have a conference for the edification of the believers. All the seeking saints received help. From November 24 to December 4, the Lord led the workers to come together. Workers from Cebu and Mindanao also came and joined us. All of them have some contributions for the Lord's work. We will have a more practical plan to carry out the work in the "great frontier land" and the "small frontier land." Brother Meek has been most enthusiastic and will set out for the gospel to the outer islands again. He hopes to preach the gospel even to the Filipinos so that they can bear the same testimony as ours. Please do not forget to pray for the small work in this remote region.</p><p>A young brother in the Lord meeting in Manila, Philippines<br />December 23</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>We have a few sisters here who would like to offer X dollars for the workers in Szechuan, Hunan, and Hankow and for the saints in need. We do not know their names or their condition. We can only find your address from The Open Door. Please discuss this with Sister Ruth Lee. Our desire is that more help should be rendered to the sisters.</p><p>Sister Ruth Chen, October 9, 1938<br />[Address omitted]</p>
