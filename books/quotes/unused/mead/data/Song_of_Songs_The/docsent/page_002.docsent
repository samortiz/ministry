   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>INTRODUCTION I</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Chapter one, verse 1 says, "The Song of songs, which is Solomon's."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This Song is about Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, the Lord takes the position of a king in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is standing on the ground of resurrection and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>David killed Goliath and overcame the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He signifies the Christ who reigns through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Solomon received the benefit of Goliath's defeat and became a king of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He signifies the Christ who reigns through resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this book the Lord stands in the position of Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are communicating with such a king as Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The battle is over, and He is now the Christ who is crowned with glory and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is what we see at the beginning of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this book, our relationship with the Lord is not like the relationship between Jonathan and David.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, it is like the relationship between the Shulamite and King Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Jonathan loved David because David overcame the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Shulamite loved Solomon because of Solomon himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some love the Lord because of His cross.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Others love Him not only because of His cross, but also because of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The cross speaks of the Lord's reign through His victory, whereas resurrection speaks of the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The queen of Sheba first heard of the acts of Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Later, she beheld Solomon in person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>She was attracted by Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, we must not only have a love like that of Jonathan toward David, but a love like that of the Shulamite toward Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This book guides us to an understanding of Him as the King.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>II</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The experience of the Shulamite is personal; it is not corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Woman in the Bible represents subjective experience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, the maiden's pursuit refers to the individual believer's pursuit of the Lord; it does not refer to the church's corporate pursuit of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It begins with a person's yearning for the Lord and ends with his satisfaction in fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>III</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The central theme of this book is spiritual fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although this book is divided into many sections, the record follows a sequence and is a continuous whole.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is not composed of isolated stories or miscellaneous anecdotes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Its emphasis is on the total spiritual experience of those who advance to pursue after the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It describes the stages they go through in their life and the ultimate state they will reach.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is in the same nature as Spiritual Torrents by Madame Guyon and Four Planes of Spiritual Life by Mrs. Penn-Lewis.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>IV</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This book describes a person's pursuit after he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, it mentions nothing about the matter of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The emphasis of this book is not sinners, but believers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is not about those who do not belong to the Lord, but about those who belong to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It does not tell us how a person seeks for salvation, but how a person desires and seeks to gain the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is not on faith, but on love.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The banner of this book is "love."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>"His banner over me was love" 2:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is our motto.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>V</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This book is a poem.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is a description of our spiritual history in poetic expressions, words, and phrases.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In many cases, one can only grasp the sense; words alone cannot explain the full meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>VI</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This book and the Gospel of Matthew describe the two aspects of the believer's relationship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As far as our duty is concerned, Matthew shows that we are a minister to the Lord, who is our King.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As far as fellowship is concerned, this book shows that we are a wife to the Lord, who is our Husband.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>VII</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The word that is most frequently used in this book is love.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There are many ways to use this word; it can be used in the singular, in the plural, as masculine, as feminine, or in a general way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For example, the word my beloved in the original language denotes a male love, whereas the word my love in the original language denotes a female love.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The word "love" in 1:2, 4, 4:10, and 7:12 is plural.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The singular form of love in this book is translated "beloved," referring to the person.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is the same word as David, because David means love.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>"Love" in 2:4 is general.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>"Love" in 2:7, 3:5, and 8:4 refers to love in the feminine sense.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>"Friends" in 5:1 and 16 should be translated "beloved"; it refers to love in the masculine sense in contrast to love in the feminine sense.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>VIII</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A few principles for the interpretation of this book:</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>1 The interpretation of every passage must match the central theme of this book, which is spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>2 The interpretation of each verse must make sense within the context of the passage, as well as match the central theme of the book.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>3 In interpreting the parables in Matthew 13, the Lord gave detailed commentary on some parts, but made no comment on other parts.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We should do the same in interpreting this book.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>4 We should find the meaning of a term partly from the word itself and partly from its historical use in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>5 In describing the bride and the bridegroom, this book uses many illustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>While the characteristics are described in figures of speech, the illustrations involve the use of symbols.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The figures of speech are easy to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But in order to understand the symbols, there must be mature consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Symbols can only be understood in accordance with biblical methods and divine teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In some instances, the nature of the figures of speech and the symbols are the same; in other instances, they are different.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In many cases, they are quite different.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We do not need to worry whether or not they are different; we should only ask what they refer to.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>A symbol can often convey something that a figure of speech cannot convey.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>For example, Revelation 1:15 says, "And His feet were like shining bronze, as having been fired in a furnace."</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Feet are a figure of speech, and we know that they refer to movement.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>"Shining bronze, as having been fired in a furnace," is a symbol, and it cannot be understood readily.</S>
