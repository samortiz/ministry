   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>APPENDIX TWO THERE IS A GOD Scripture Reading: Psa 14:1; Heb 11:6; Rom 3:19-20</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This afternoon we will speak on a difficult subject.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In fact it may be quite hard to speak on such a subject.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I must admit that this is the second time in my life that I have spoken of this subject.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What is the subject?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is what Hebrews 11:6 says: "He who comes forward to God must believe that He is."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is also what Psalms 14:1 says: "The fool has said in his heart,/There is no God."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Actually, there is no need to speak about the subject of the existence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Bible does not debate this subject; it assumes that man believes there is a God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is no reason for man to say that there is no God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is as though this matter is settled.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yet there are some in the world who consider themselves atheists.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They say that there is no God, and they do not acknowledge the existence of a God who rules over everything.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This philosophy appears to be quite fashionable and appealing to men.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Those who hold such a philosophy appear to be more progressive than others in their mentality and more capable than others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, they dare to speak in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But before I point out their errors, I would like first to show you that there are different kinds of atheists.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How many kinds of atheists are there?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some kinds are not worthy of our debate; they are not even worthy of our greetings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Others are more noble, and it is worthwhile to debate with them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There may be some among us who are atheists.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I must tell you that it is only worthwhile to speak to certain kinds of atheists.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Let me ask you, "What kind of atheist are you?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although atheists do not admit that there are different kinds, we outsiders are more objective and can classify them according to their kind.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE IMMORAL ATHEISTS</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is no need to speak with this kind of atheist or engage in any arguments with them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All we have to do is look at their conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although many people will not admit that they are atheists, their conduct tells us that they are atheists.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is no need for them to say anything; in fact, they do not have the ground to say anything, because their immorality speaks louder and clearer than their words.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They have become atheists because their conduct requires that they be atheists, not because they have ample reasons to support their views.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Their immorality prevents them from admitting that there is a God in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A robber would like to believe that there is no policeman, a bad student that there is no teacher, a difficult employee that there is no employer, and an evil person that there is no law.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This does not mean that they really believe that these do not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It only means that their conduct forces them to say that these things do not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If a person says, "I do not believe in God; there is no such thing as God in my mind," you can hold his hand and ask him, "Friend, are you moral?"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You do not need to say anything else; you only need to ask if he is moral.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A man can believe that there is no God, but he cannot believe that there is no morality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although I am not an old man, ninety-nine percent of all the atheists that I have met throughout the years have had doubtful moral character.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I have never seen an atheist whose moral character is trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some of you sitting here are older than I am.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I do not know if you have met an atheist whose moral character is trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The atheists among our classmates, colleagues, and friends do not believe in God because they are very evil morally.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I must tell you a fact: whenever God goes out of a man's life, immorality comes in.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In America there was a famous preacher by the name of Mr. R.A. Torrey.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Once he was preaching in a place, and a college student came and said to him, "I used to believe that there is a God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But I do not believe anymore."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When Mr. Torrey asked him for the reason, he said, "When I started college, I acquired more knowledge and did not want to believe in God anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After I read this book and that book, God was nowhere to be found."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Mr. Torrey said, "No. Don't deceive me.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I also graduated from college and have read many books.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I have even received a doctorate degree.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But I have not put God away through my studying.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There must be some other reason.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Otherwise, it would be impossible to put God away through your studying.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Let me ask you a question.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Since your denial of the existence of God, what has become of your moral character?"</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The student answered honestly, "I can only admit that I am not as morally good as I was before."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Mr. Torrey then gave a wonderful answer: "There is no need for me to argue with you anymore, and there is no need for me to give you the reasons for God's existence.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you stop your evil works and if your moral character becomes more noble, God will immediately come back to you."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many people do not believe in God because they have thousands of sins which hinder them from believing, not because they have many reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They are forced to become atheists.</S>
