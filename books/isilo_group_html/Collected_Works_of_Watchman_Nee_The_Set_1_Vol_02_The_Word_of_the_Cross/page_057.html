The only passport to salvation is the blood of the Lamb of God. Only this blood can protect man from the wrath which is to come. In God's Word, the "blood" is mentioned over four hundred times. From this we can see that the blood is important. Whosoever receives the blood of Jesus Christ for the covering of sins is undoubtedly saved already. This salvation is absolutely complete and eternal. The true knowledge of the value of the blood of the Lord is most effective in keeping man away from sin.</P>	<ol class="upper-roman">	<li>The blood of Christ is the price of the believer's redemption:		<ol class="upper-alpha">		<li>"Obtained through His own blood" (Acts 20:28)</li>		<li>"Have redemption through His blood" (Eph. 1:7; Col. 1:14)</li>		<li>"With precious blood...the blood of Christ" (1 Pet. 1:18-19)</li>		<li>"Have purchased...by Your blood" (Rev. 5:9)</li>		</ol></li>	<li>The blood of Christ is the foundation of the believer's forgiveness of sins.
