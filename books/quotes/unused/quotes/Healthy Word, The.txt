In our experience we first gain the Lord as our life, then we have the reality, and the reality eventually becomes the way
In verse 6 the Lord mentioned the way first because the disciples had asked Him to show them the way to the Father
Before we can have the way, we need to have the reality, and in order to have the reality, we first need to experience life
They studied whether to use one large cup or many small cups, leavened or unleavened bread, one large loaf or many small pieces
The truth in the doctrines concerning the Lord's table is the Body of Christ, Christ the Head, and the death and resurrection of Christ
The bread and the cup, which signify the Lord's body and His blood, being separate on the table displays the Lord's death
In this way we not only keep a practice according to doctrine, but we also touch the truth within the doctrine
Many ordinary believers do not fully know the doctrine of justification by faith, yet they have the reality of justification by faith
They have received and experienced Christ, and this living Christ becomes their justification received through faith
Regrettably, however, some have the doctrine, the shell, of justification by faith, but they do not have the reality, the content
If we have received the Lord, even if we do not know that our sins are forgiven, we have received the gift of forgiveness
No doctrine can set us free; it is the reality contained and conveyed in the truth, the reality that is Christ Himself, that sets us free
We need the Lord to unveil to us the truth, the reality, of the doctrines concerning practices such as the Lord's table and baptism
It is possible to have the Lord's table according to the Bible and thus be scriptural but still miss the reality
As branches in the vine, we need to have prevailing prayer each day for the Lord to strengthen us to live Him, grow Him, and produce Him
The salvation mentioned in verse 12 is not salvation from hell but salvation from everything outside of Christ
The reality of love, humility, kindness, wisdom, and every virtue is simply Christ experienced by us as our life
In some local churches a misleading word has been spoken that we must 'get our hands dirty' in order to 'catch fish'
Some have taught that, according to this principle, we should go to various worldly places in order to gain new ones
If we continually live Christ, our relatives, neighbors, friends, schoolmates, and colleagues will see what kind of person we are
If we bring people to the Lord simply by living Christ and speaking a simple word as the Lord leads, our fruit will remain
If concepts, ways, activities, and organization are removed from today's Christianity, there will be nothing left
If we are truly living Christ, we even do not need to seek His leading in how to preach the gospel, for the gospel will be our living
We often complicate the Christian life by thinking about different ways and by initiating different activities
Now, as our Savior, Lord, and Master, He is sitting at the right hand of God, and one day He will come back to receive us
Today while He is in the heavens and we are waiting on the earth for His coming back, we can live by Him, taking Him as our life
Especially if we have spent time in different religious groups thoughts will often come into our mind to bother distract veil and cover us
If we pray in this way, we will be preserved in a simple and pure way to enjoy the Lord's presence and the church life
Our human spirit is indwelt by Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit, and these two spirits are mingled together as one
The proper way to live, work, serve, and worship is the reality, the truth, which we have through the experience of Christ
The way for us to preach the gospel is not the demonstration of natural ability or the use of gimmicks such as plays or musical performances
John 1:18 says, 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
The picture of God's image is in Genesis 1, but the person who is the real image of God is in the New Testament
The Old Testament is a book of shadows and pictures, and the New Testament is a book of fulfillment, reality, and truth
In the New Testament, when John the Baptist saw the Lord, he said, 'Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world'!
Timothy 2:15 says, 'Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, an unashamed workman, cutting straight the word of the truth'
Christ was and is eternally the Son of God, but before the New Testament time He did not possess the human nature
God needed a man in order to fulfill His eternal purpose, and God needed a man also to defeat Satan, His enemy
Ephesians 1:22 says, 'He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church'
When we are asked who the leader of our church is, we should answer that Christ, and not anyone else, is the Leader
Within the last few years a certain brother traveled to many places and told the saints that he is the future leader of the Lord's recovery
If anyone says that we should submit to a certain brother because he is God's anointed, we should say, 'We all are anointed'
The head does not send a message to one member and depend on that member to pass on the message to another member
If we hear this kind of speaking, we should immediately rise up and declare that this is an insult to our Head, Christ
Whenever we come to the Lord's table and see the loaf, we should see the Body of Christ and thank the Lord for making us members of His Body
Placing one church over others is something of organization and hierarchy, which insult the headship of Christ
If we do not have the adequate, thorough knowledge of the truth, it is difficult for us to have the necessary discernment in such matters
In order to learn the truth and be brought to the full knowledge of the truth, we need to spend time in the Bible
If the Head, Christ, is the manifestation of God in the flesh, surely the church, His Body, also is the manifestation of God in the flesh
When we consider the elders according to the natural concept, we think that the elders are higher than the other members
A basic principle among the people of God today is that whoever wants to be great must be a serving one, even a slave
Peter 5:3, a word to the elders, says, 'Nor as lording it over your allotments but by becoming patterns of the flock'
Helps must refer to the services of the deacons, and administrations must refer to the functions of the elders
On the one hand, the elders are slaves, but on the other hand, the saints in the church should obey their leading ones
Another matter concerning the elders in the churches is that the Lord never allows there to be only one elder in a church
The elders in a church should not choose from among themselves one brother to be the top elder over the others
By this we can see that the leadership among the apostles and elders is not official, permanent, or organizational
The case of Paul and Barnabas also proves that the leadership in the New Testament age depends upon the present spiritual capacity
On their journey, however, Paul came to the forefront, because by that time he had a higher spiritual capacity
Any time we come to the Bible with an open heart, even before we open the book, we have the sense that we have come into the presence of God
Even if we have been a Christian for many years, we may never have realized that the Bible is the breathing of our heavenly Father
God's divine element and all the riches of His divine attributes are continually transmitted into us as we read the Word
Some may be discouraged from reading the Bible because they do not understand everything or remember what they read
When our morning time is finished, we will go into our day with the nourishment we have received from God's breathing
We need to regard our contact with the Lord in the morning through the word as more important than our breakfast
In the two Epistles to Timothy and the Epistle to Titus the word healthy is used six times to describe God's divine word
These Epistles were written at a time when the church was in degradation, and at such a time some teachings and doctrines are not healthy
The healthy word and the healthy teaching are the truth, containing the killing element and the nourishing element
Because the Corinthians were full of germs, they needed the spiritual antibiotics in the word of the cross, the killing word
As we continue prayreading we will be supplied with life by the same word which also contains the nourishing element of Christs resurrection
It is not we ourselves but the negative things within us, such as our natural life and our flesh, that are killed
Although the Bible is available to everyone today, regrettably, not many Christians apply the Bible in a practical way to their daily living
To be luminaries shining over the darkness by holding forth the word of life is the best way to preach the gospel
By reading three chapters in the Old Testament and one chapter in the New Testament each day, we can read the whole Bible once a year
Because of this lack of the truth, in recent years several corrupting things have crept into the churches from God's enemy
We would know that in the Lord's recovery there is no organization and that no one sent by God would say that he is the leader
When we open our being and exercise our spirit to contact the living Lord, His holy nature will be infused into our being
Thousands of missionaries went to China in the nineteenth century to preach the gospel, but very few preached the truth of salvation
As we have pointed out, the Spirit and the Bible are the two 'wires' through which God, Christ, and life are transmitted into our being
No heresy will be able to creep into the church, because all the saints will be healthy, strong, and infused with the truth
The best way to contact the Lord, even before we kneel, sit, or open the Bible, is to speak something simple, such as, 'O Lord
A Christian should be a speaking person, speaking not only to people and to God but also to angels, demons, and even the atmosphere
Answer: No matter how busy a person is, he always finds time to eat, because he realizes that eating is a necessity of life
Because Christianity today is under degradation, what is covered in these two Epistles fits our present situation
In verse 5 Paul writes, 'The end of the charge is love out of a pure heart and out of a good conscience and out of unfeigned faith'
We can see three subjective things related to God's economy-a pure heart, a good conscience, and unfeigned faith
If our heart is impure, if our conscience has some offense, or if our faith is not true but hypocritical, we cannot practice God's economy
We can keep our conscience without offense by confessing in order to be cleansed by the precious blood of Jesus
He thinks that after he has worked hard all day his wife should have cooked something that would make him happy but it is just the opposite
Because he is somewhat unhappy, when his wife tries to talk to him, he does not answer but only has a sullen countenance
As soon as we sense the smallest offense on our conscience, we should confess to the Lord in a simple way and ask for forgiveness
In order to see what God's economy is, we need to consider each instance in which the word economy is used in the New Testament
The word economy in the New Testament is not a translation but an anglicized Greek word that means 'stewardship'
The word economy means a stewardship as an administration to dispense the life necessities to the members of a household
Paul's ministry, which was part of this stewardship, was to dispense Christ as the supply to all those in God's house
All the apostles, from Peter to Timothy, were stewards in this one stewardship, dispensing Christ to God's children
The entire New Testament was written to carry out God's economy to dispense Christ as the life supply to the children of God
Apparently, the four Gospels are different from one another, but actually, they all teach Christ, only from different angles
Each photo will show different aspects of the person, but together they will give a complete picture of the person
Concerning who He is we can list many different titles such as Redeemer Savior Lord Master Creator Shepherd Bridegroom and High Priest
Concerning what He is He is the life the light the way the truth the door the pasture the water the bread of life and the Lamb of God
Whenever we are in a dark time, we should not be disappointed but realize that Christ is our bright new beginning at that very moment
All the apostles from Peter to Timothy taught the same thing, God's economy, which is to dispense Christ into the believers
Even as early as the first century, other teachings crept in besides the one teaching concerning Christ for the church
When the law is taught, questions may be stirred up regarding matters such as the keeping of the Sabbath, circumcision, and diet
For more than ten years, nothing but Christ for the church was ministered here, and there were no questionings
In the past few years the enemy has crept in with dissenting, distracting talk of different ways, producing questions
We do not need to be complicated by considerations of whether or not we should do certain things or go to certain places
God the Father is a farmer, and His economy is to grow a universal vine that includes Christ and all the believers
The traditional understanding is that godliness is piety, pious behavior or conduct, or a reverent attitude toward God
According to this definition, we need to have a living in the likeness of God, a behavior that bears the likeness of God
It is not that our behavior and living should merely bear the likeness of God but that God Himself should be manifested in us
Isaiah 5323 says He has no attracting form nor majesty that we should look upon Him Nor beautiful appearance that we should desire Him
In Him-in His walk, in His living, and in His whole life-others could see the manifestation of God in the flesh
It is not that Christ's daily walk merely bore the likeness of God; rather, God Himself was manifested in Christ in His living
We may think that the ascension of Christ is one thing and that the rapture of the church is another, later thing
The ascension of Christ is the receiving of the Head into glory, and the rapture of the church is the receiving of the Body into glory
Corinthians 142425 indicates that if we have a normal proper Christian meeting when an unbeliever enters he will say Indeed God is among you
We have no worldly amusement or entertainment, but we have the mystery of godliness, the manifestation of God in the flesh
The first thing he did every morning was to read the Bible and pray, mingling his prayer with the reading of the Word
Muller's practice to combine his prayer with his reading of the Word of God no doubt contributed to his long life
We should pray and seek the Lord to live a life in all godliness and to exercise ourselves unto godliness in everything
George Muller said that in his morning time in the Word, he would read a verse and then turn the words into prayer
We do not need to interpret the Word in order to compose a prayer; we can simply use the words of the Bible as the words of our prayer
Deep breathing brings a supply of fresh air into our body and also discharges negative elements, thus cleansing our body
Other speaking that is versus the healthy teaching includes the law myths and unending genealogies profane and oldwomanish myths and gossip
Timothy 2:16-17 says, 'Avoid profane, vain babblings, for they will advance to more ungodliness, and their word will spread like gangrene'
Verse 23 says, 'Foolish questionings and those arising from an untrained mind refuse, knowing that they beget contentions'
The healthy word is always the word of the truth, the words of the faith, the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the word of the Scriptures
The Bible apparently is composed of various stories, histories, parables, exhortations, teachings, doctrines, and forms
Anytime we pray-read a portion of the Bible, we will receive Christ, the killing power of His death, and His resurrection power
The Lord within will not allow us to continue pray-reading until we confess our failure and ask for His forgiveness
After receiving the killing of Christ's death when pray-reading the word, we will also receive His resurrection
In our breathing of the healthy word, we take in the riches of Christ, the killing of His death, and His resurrecting power
No matter how much eloquence, excitement, or humor a message may contain, it is not healthy if it does not convey Christ
Mothers know that serving their children too many sweets will ruin their health and even negatively affect their behavior
Healthy words and healthy teaching always convey Christ, the killing of His death, and the power of His resurrection
We should receive only the healthy word-the words of the faith, the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, the word of the truth, and all Scripture
One such word is 2 Timothy 2:1, which says, 'You therefore, my child, be empowered in the grace which is in Christ Jesus'
In the past some among us have said that we should be liberated from any legalities or standards because we cannot change what we are
Timothy 6:11 says, 'You, O man of God, flee these things, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, meekness'
Timothy 4:12 says, 'Let no one despise your youth, but be a pattern to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity'
We need to receive only the healthy word and have our concepts thoroughly washed from the germs of any unhealthy speaking
If we read the two Epistles to Timothy to find all the imperative words, the Holy Spirit will spontaneously lead us to have a high standard
Timothy 1:7 says, 'God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of sobermindedness'
We should not be wishy-washy like jellyfish; rather, we should have a strong spirit with a strong will, a loving heart, and a sober mind
Unlike religious Christianity, the Lord's recovery is not a matter of activities, movements, ways, organizations, or concepts
God has chosen us with the purpose that Christ would be dispensed and wrought into our being to become our constitution
The New Testament uses the word economy , which indicates a stewardship to dispense Christ into God's children
Regrettably, immediately after God's dispensation in His New Testament economy began, certain things other than Christ crept into the church
While Paul was on his way to arrest the Christians in Damascus, the Lord appeared to him from the heavens and knocked him to the ground
The Christ who is revealed in us, who lives in us, and who is formed in us is absolutely versus any kind of religion
Christ our portion is the image, the expression, of the invisible God, and in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily
In other words, in this portion we enjoy not only the expression, the image, of the invisible God but also all that God is
Colossians 2:16-17 shows that all positive things are a shadow of Christ, indicating that Christ is the reality of every positive thing
Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all'
To consider that we or others in the church are of a certain race or nationality is to have the concept of the old man
The spiritual life, the divine, eternal life of God, is altogether mysterious, abstract, intangible, and invisible yet real and living
In order to have electricity in a house, we must first install the wires, which make the electricity real and practical
Whenever we come to the Bible with a sincere heart and an open spirit, we immediately touch Christ as the Spirit
Countless sinners have been converted simply by reading the Bible and countless Christians have been transformed by reading this living book
We are transformed not by teaching or admonishing but by reading the Bible to contact the breathing of the living God
Some believers may think that they do not need to read the Bible, because afterward they do not remember what they have read
Our purpose in coming to the Bible is not primarily to memorize but to be refreshed and enlivened by God's breathing
Like the apostle Paul, we will be able to say, 'Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death
To explain how the word is the embodiment of God, Christ, the Spirit, and life, we may use the illustration of electricity
We can do this by touching the Word, just as we can receive and apply electricity simply by switching on a light or an appliance
The Bible as God's breath conveys God, Christ, the Spirit, and life into our being, just as a wire conveys electricity into a building
Many of us can testify of experiencing the wonderful fact that God, Christ, the Spirit, and life are embodied in and conveyed by the Word
The Bible is the divine revelation, but it is also more, for it not only allows us to see God but also conveys God into our being
Whether or not we understand God's word in the Bible, we need to eat it, for it is rich food that embodies God Himself
The Lord said, 'I am the living bread which came down out of heaven,' and 'He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me'
The Bible, which is good for food, is composed of three basic elements-Christ, the death of Christ, and the resurrection of Christ
Whether we read a chapter from Genesis, Psalms, Matthew, or Ephesians, we will receive Christ, the cross, and resurrection
The word of the cross kills our flesh, our natural man, our temper, our disposition, our self, and our selfish intentions
The whole book of 1 Corinthians is the word of the cross, because Paul wrote it to deal with the many problems in the church in Corinth
Letting the word of Christ make home in us is a matter not of remembering with our mind but of exercising our spirit
The proper way to live the Christian life is to contact the word in the Bible, which embodies God, Christ, the Spirit, and the divine life
We can read, pray, and sing the word to receive the elements of Christ, His killing death, and His nourishing resurrection
As a result, we will walk with the Lord and in the Lord, always experiencing the killing and the nourishing, the operating of death and life
The law was given as a shadow, figure, or type, just as a photograph of a person may be sent before the person comes
Leviticus describes all kinds of offeringsthe burnt offering the meal offering the peace offering the sin offering and the trespass offering
He is the real burnt offering, the real meal offering, the real peace offering, the real sin offering, and the real trespass offering for us
When he replied that he had, she said that she could tell by looking at his face that actually he had not been regenerated
We not only should know that holiness is Christ, but we also should be able to find the verse that proves this and expound it
Another test of whether we adequately know the truth may come if someone questions us concerning who the leader of the church is
Peter 5:3, a word written to the elders, says, 'Nor as lording it over your allotments but by becoming patterns of the flock'
To consider any man other than Christ as the leader of a local church or the Lord's recovery damages the truth
The concept of a man being the leader of the churches leads to hierarchy, which is a great insult to the headship of Christ
In the New Testament age, Christ's leadership has been fully established, and His headship has been fully completed
Ephesians 1:22 says that God subjected all things under Christ's feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church
When the pillar of the truth is added to the foundation of life, the building of the church in the Lord's recovery will be solid
All the saints need to know the truth so that the church would be built up as the pillar and base of the truth
Timothy 2:15 says, 'Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, an unashamed workman, cutting straight the word of the truth'
We saw in the previous chapter that the elements composing the Bible are Christ, His death, and His resurrection
When we read the Bible, we should exercise not only our mind to deal with the printed matter but also our spirit to contact the Spirit
If we exercise only our mind to read the Bible, we will receive only biblical knowledge and no spiritual reality
If we exercise our spirit to contact the Spirit while reading the Bible, the doctrine will become the truth to us
Christians of another category tend toward the other extreme, caring only for the Spirit and neglecting the Word
