   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MATERIALS FOR BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Apostle Paul also speaks about a building with stones.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"For we are laborers together with God: ye are God's farm, ye are God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is" 1 Cor 3:9-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul says that the apostles are God's co-workers working with God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Their purpose is to build.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And we are God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On one hand we are the materials for the building, and on the other hand we are the co-builders with God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is why Paul says that we must all be careful with what material we build.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can build with gold, silver, and precious stone, or wood, hay, and stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There are two categories of materials.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first category is fireproof, while the second is the best material for burning.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we were to construct a building of gold, silver, and precious stones, the fire department would immediately approve it; it would be one hundred percent fireproof.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>COVERED AND VEILED</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 1 Corinthians, Paul tells us clearly that we are the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are not destined to be this or that.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are destined to be stones built up in God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before we came to the church life, we seldom heard of our being stones for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Most Christians completely miss God's central purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>May the Lord have mercy upon us that we may see something deeper, higher, and richer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not care for wood, hay, and stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are here to be precious stones for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For us to see this requires the Lord's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul says in 1 Corinthians 3 that he is the master-builder who has laid the foundation, and that the Corinthians are the building as well as the co-builders.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, they must be the proper building with the proper materials.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The matter of building is so clear in this book, yet most Christians today will not see it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They can read this book many times, but they see nothing of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Instead, they pick up the negative things and argue for them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I have never met one Christian in Christianity who asked about the building in 1 Corinthians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is because most of the Christians today have been distracted and veiled.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Tongue-speaking, divine healing, and many other things have become layer upon layer of veils to them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Tongue-speaking is one layer, divine healing is another, even spirituality is another.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must get through all these layers!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not care merely for spirituality; we should not care merely for being holy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should care for God's building!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>STONES, STONES, STONES</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many scriptural things have been used by the enemy to distract and to veil the Lord's children.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need the unveiling that we may see the light.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then our eyes will be enlarged to be like pools.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Look at all these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>John 1:42 has the word "stone."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Matthew 16:18 has "stone."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>First Corinthians 3:12 has "stones."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>First Peter 2:5 has "stones."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>And Revelation 21:19 has "stones."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All we have in these verses are stones, stones, and more stones.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Matthew is the first book of the New Testament, and Revelation is the last.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>From the beginning to the end of the New Testament, we see stones.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is a book of stones!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord Jesus mentions stones, Peter mentions stones, Paul mentions stones, and John mentions stones.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Peter, Paul, and John are the main writers in the composition of the New Testament, and all their writings speak of stones for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At the very beginning of the New Testament age, when Simon came to Jesus, the Lord immediately changed his name to Peter, a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After Peter stayed with the Lord for two or three years, he recognized Him as the Christ, the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then the Lord told him that there is also something else.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>"You are a stone," He said, "for the building up of My church."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then later Peter told the saints that they were all living stones to be built up a spiritual house.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Paul also spoke the same thing, and eventually the Apostle John gave the conclusion to the whole New Testament and even to the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He said that the wall of the New Jerusalem is jasper, a precious stone, and the foundations of the wall are garnished with all manner of precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>So at the end of the entire Bible we see a building which has been built up with precious stones, with Peter as one of the twelve foundation stones, for the foundation stones bear the names of the twelve Apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is not my teaching, message, or opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It has been buried in the Bible for centuries, but now the Lord has been merciful to us and has removed the covering.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Now we see that we are all stones to be built up for God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The enemy is so subtle.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He does his best to make the situation foggy and cloudy.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must pray, "Lord, take away all the fog and the clouds.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Grant us a clear sky to see Your eternal purpose."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>For the church to go on, we all need a clear sky without any fog or cloud.</S>
