   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Many times, due to our single-hearted work and our untiring diligence, we lead many to Christ and receive a great following of men.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The "self" then creeps in!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As a result, we receive a name that is living.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may become satisfied with the people we have gathered around us and may rest in this fruit and forget the Lord of life and power.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Naturally, this makes the Lord unable to use us anymore, and we will end up with many shortcomings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How different the Lord was when He was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In every step of His way, He tried to make men ignore Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He could do this because He was walking with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The more He went on, the brighter it became, until eventually, those following Him could not bear the light.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even those following Him were not able to bear the light.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"Behold, an hour is coming, and has come, that you will be scattered each to his own place and will leave Me alone; yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me" John 16:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our Lord did not try once throughout His life to use the slightest means to attract people to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He was satisfied with His Father, and He believed that all that the Father gave Him would come to Him John 6:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this way He went step by step until He reached His death at the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul was the same.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was full of faith and power.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He himself walked with God, but those who walked with him could not match his standard.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, when he went on, the others had to be left behind.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As a result, his way became more and more lonely.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Towards the end he said, "All who are in Asia turned away from me" 2 Tim 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"No one was with me to support me, but all abandoned me" 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although the Lord used Paul to gain a lot of people, when he was suffering in prison, only one person went to visit him!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The more we fellowship with God, the lonelier we will become.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our responsibility is to have our works complete before God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All our works should be done in the light of God's countenance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To take this attitude will inevitably make us lonely.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The result of faithfulness is to be oblivious to man's criticism.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those works that are not complete are mostly the works that have a name they are living but are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is because these works are done for men and not for God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although the more faithful we are, the lonelier we will become, we should nevertheless walk with other saints and should seek to please them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The closer we are to Christ, the more we should have a love for all the believers, for those who have seen the meekness of Christ cannot possibly be hard towards others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we draw near to God, surely we experience God's pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Yet the more we seek for God's pleasure, the lonelier we will become.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As the pathway of Christ is forever lonely, ours is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although He is full of kindness and humility, and although He is so willing to listen to us and to wash our feet, in the end He was still left alone.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"Become watchful."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The believers in Sardis had forgotten the coming of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is not right, for they were not like this at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They should have renewed their faith and aspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This calling to watchfulness proves to us that the church in Sardis consisted of saved Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord cannot ask the unbelievers to be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Only those who have life can be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If the Lord were speaking to the unbelievers, He should have asked them to repent and to believe in Him to receive eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The calling for watchfulness can only be heard by the saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord wants them to be watchful concerning His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They had chosen the way of the world and were living in the world as if everything was going to be the same forever.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although there was no corruption or superstition, coldness and sleepiness were their true condition.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Watchfulness, therefore, is the unique solution.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"Establish the things which remain."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They have indeed received much from the Lord; however, they have not kept what they have received.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although there were things that remained, that which remained was about to die.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Because the situation was bleak, stagnation and desertion became a temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord held them responsible for recovering the original condition, for establishing those things which were about to die, and for keeping them from dying, because those things which remained were God's own works.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The word "dead" in verse one is explained here by the words "about to die."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord does not consider the church in Sardis a church filled with perishing ones.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord's word here is to a saved church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Although in Protestantism, represented by Sardis, there were many perishing ones mixed in with the others, we have to remember that Sardis was an actual church at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This actual church had received salvation already.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should view all seven letters in this way; there was an actual church and there is the period represented by that church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>These seven churches show us how they will be judged according to what they are responsible for.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the precursor of the judgment seat.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is not a question of grace but a principle of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What is spoken of here is not the position of salvation but the condition of responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Naturally, there were many nominal and unsaved ones in the churches throughout the various ages represented.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, in those seven actual churches, although there were many sins, the people there were saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Even if the church was as corrupted as Thyatira, as weak as Sardis, and as cold as Laodicea, the people there were still saved.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we realize that what is covered here is not a matter of salvation but a matter of responsibility, we will see that the death mentioned in verse one does not refer to the fact that they have no spiritual life, but to the fact that their works were cold and that those who remained were dying.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Under such circumstance, there is no way to strengthen them except by diligent revival.</S>
