	 <h2 class="head1">PERFECTING BEING BUILDING AND<br />
NOT MERELY EDIFICATION</h2>
<p>To edify means to make something better, that is, to improve it. Edification also implies that something is made useful. Building, however, does not mean only to make something better and useful but also to build something as part of a house. Suppose we have some wood. We should work on it not only to make it smooth; we should also use it as a beam or a pillar in a house. It should be built as part of a house. This is the meaning of <em>perfecting</em> in Ephesians 4:12.</p>
<p>We stopped using the term <em>edification meeting</em> and started saying <em>building meeting,</em> because we are not merely edifying the saints. A person who makes wood or stone sculptures is doing a work of edification. After carving, edifying, the wood or stone, it is put on display for people to admire. This kind of work is incomplete. Most of the work in Christianity of preaching the gospel and holding revivals and Bible studies merely edifies the believers to improve them. This work does not contain much perfecting or building. As a result, many Christians receive spiritual edification and are beautiful, but they are not built up.</p>
<p>We can cut a precious stone and make it beautiful for people to appreciate, but this does not mean that the stone has been built into a building. Some believers are qualified to be admired by the church or by Christianity, but they cannot coordinate with others to become the dwelling place of God in spirit. They cannot be built. They are individual Christians who are good and beautiful, but they cannot be built up with other believers to function and serve in coordination.</p>
<p>There is a big difference between edification and building. We do not want merely spiritual brothers and sisters who are individuals in the district meetings. Rather, we want every meeting to have brothers and sisters who are perfected to exercise their function and are built up. We still need to learn in this matter.</p>
<p>We should not understand this to be something organizational and think that we need to learn to arrange and organize the district meetings. It is vain to organize the district meetings, because organizing is not building. The work that we are speaking of should be done in every locality and in every meeting. We have learned something from the Lord, and we know how to work, but while we are working, we need to perfect others so that they are built up. Then every saint can be responsible and manifest his function. He can also coordinate with other saints. This is the way that the church will be able to develop and expand and will be able to meet the many aspects of the Lord&rsquo;s need locally.</p>
<p>If there is a need to preach the gospel, a local church that is built up can preach the gospel. The church will also be able to support, shepherd, and care for new believers. There will be a genuine expression of the Body in that locality such that the saints who desire to learn to serve will be in the coordination. This church is the house of God, where God&rsquo;s people belong and have a home. These are the obvious functions of a church that is built up. There are also still deeper functions. All the functions result from a group of brothers and sisters who are perfected and built up in a locality. Therefore, we should not despise perfecting and building up.</p>
<h2 class="head1">COORDINATION AND BUILDING<br />
BRINGING IN GOD&rsquo;S BLESSING</h2>
<p>There are no spiritual giants among us. Every one of us is a nobody. If we compare what we have with what is in Christianity outwardly, we will see that we have very little, and our condition is far from satisfactory. We truly feel that we are short in many matters; we are inadequate in many matters. Therefore, God can bless us only in a limited way. Nevertheless, the blessing that we receive is more than what other Christian groups receive.</p>
<p>Take the church in Taipei for example. Even though the district meetings are weak, the church was able to establish twenty-nine meetings where numerous brothers and sisters meet and serve together regularly. We once notified the saints that we would hold a conference the next day, and more than two thousand saints attended the conference. In contrast, many Christian organizations may use advertisements but still have only two or three hundred people in a conference. What is the source of our blessing? We are blessed, not because we have spiritual giants or famous preachers but because we have the elements of coordination and building. If we remove the elements of coordination and building, our situation will be more desolate than the situation in Christianity.</p>
<p>We are being blessed because we pay attention to coordination and building. The little amount of coordination and building among us causes God to bless us. Coordination and building uphold God&rsquo;s blessing. This fellowship is to strengthen our impression of building. The workers may consider that it is sufficient to have the tree of life, but this is not enough.</p>
