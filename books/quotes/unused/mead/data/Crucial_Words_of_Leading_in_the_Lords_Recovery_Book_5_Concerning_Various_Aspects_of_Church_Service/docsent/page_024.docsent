   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Gospel in the Schools,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Gospel in the Community, and</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>the Gospel to the Children</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The second line of the gospel is the gospel in the schools.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to statistics, the city of Taipei has about one hundred ten thousand college students and two hundred sixty thousand students in junior high school and high school This is a total of three hundred seventy thousand students.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must work on these three hundred seventy thousand students.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The third line of the gospel is the community gospel, and the fourth line is the children s work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should not only preach the gospel to the children but also labor on the children with weekly children s meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, there are four lines related to the gospel: the homes, the schools, the community, and the children.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE COMMUNITY GOSPEL The Working Saints</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Two full-time co-workers are willing to promote the gospel in the community.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to begin, we need statistics concerning the number of working saints.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the medical field there are forty-five medical doctors and eighty-two nurses.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Fourteen saints are associated with the police force, thirty-four work either with the post office or the telephone and the telegram offices, four are lawyers, and eleven are engineers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Three saints are factory managers, fourteen are company presidents, and twenty-four are general managers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Eighteen saints own companies, and twenty-two are directors.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Six saints are representatives in the National Assembly, and one is a legislator.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These are general statistics of the employment situation of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Working Saints Opening Their Homes</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>to Invite Their Fellow Workers to Hear the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In preaching the gospel in the community we should not go to a police station or a factory to preach the gospel; neither should we hold a gospel conference in a hospital.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead, two responsible brothers, who take the lead in the community gospel, need to learn the skill of preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then they should not preach the gospel directly but teach others to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, the two brothers need to contact the working saints.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For example, the two co-workers need to contact the forty-five saints who are doctors, one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They can go to one brother s home to fellowship and pray with him and encourage him to open his home for the gospel to people in the medical field.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The co-workers can encourage him to invite his doctor colleagues and their families to his home so that he can preach the gospel while the full-time brothers assist him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the way that we preach the gospel to people who work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The working saints should preach the gospel to their fellow workers, that is, to those in their occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Their colleagues may be more receptive to them because they have something in common.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the past preachers gave sermons, but our present leading is completely different.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The full-timers should prepare what the brothers and sisters need.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If they need Bibles and gospel tracts, the full-timers should prepare them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If they need chairs to be arranged, the full-timers should arrive early to help arrange the chairs.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then the saints should preach the gospel themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If a saint does not know how to speak, the full-timers should teach him how to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This way of leading is not a dream; it comes from our observation and personal experience.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I studied the way believers preach the gospel in every country that I visited.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When I was in Brazil, I spent quite some time observing the largest Christian group there.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In America I even studied the method that the Mormons use.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Mormonism is heretical because it teaches that the Lord Jesus is not God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, in America no Christian group can surpass the Mormons in their work.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This success confirms the leading we had thirty years ago concerning practicing the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is regrettable that we later neglected this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The success of the Mormons depends on their practice of small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Mormons do not have great evangelists who concentrate on the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Instead, in the small groups they study what should be done and make a plan to be carried out by the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Their way is altogether practical, not theoretical.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For this reason, they are more successful than many Christian groups.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the international airport in Los Angeles, America, there are young Mormon men in teams of two, dressed in suits.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They approach Chinese students arriving from China, and in fluent Chinese they offer to give the newcomers a ride to their destination.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They can even sit down and engage in a long conversation on world politics in beautiful Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many new Chinese students who are not familiar with the surroundings are gained by the Mormons, because of their zealous help.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the reason that many Chinese join the Mormons.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The training that the Mormons receive is practical.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They learn not only to greet others but also to converse about world politics, and they can speak in good Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After observing them, I feel that our work has not been practical.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The leading in this fellowship is based on our observation and study of both others and ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For example, after considering and studying various aspects of other groups, we discovered that their success depends on the use of small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This principle cannot be changed.</S>
