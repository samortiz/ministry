   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE SON S RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN HIS DIVINITY WITH HIS HUMANITY 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 3:18; Rom 1:4; 1 Cor 15:44a; John 10:17-18; 1 Thes 4:14; Rom 10:9; 8:11; Acts 13:33; Rom 8:29; 1 Pet 1:3; Heb 2:11-12; John 12:24; 1 Cor 15:45b</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thus far, we have seen the Word s incarnation, the Son s living on this earth, and the Son s death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Son s death is all-inclusive, excellent, and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After death there is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Son s resurrection, which is the fourth item in God s New Testament economy, is even more mysterious than His death.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A PROOF OF RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 1936 I was speaking to a group of university students in the old capital of China, Peking.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Their university was one of the top universities in China.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After I spoke, a young student came to me and told me that the thing that bothered him about the Christian faith was the teaching of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He could not understand how a man could die and be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In front of the window where we were standing was a wheat field.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Pointing to the wheat field, I told him that it was full of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then, I explained to him that when a grain of wheat is sown into the earth it dies.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then after it dies it grows up in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I told him that we could see resurrection everywhere in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I pointed out to him strongly that a grain of wheat dies, but it does not stop at death because through its death it grows; thus, its growth is by its death.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Actually a grain of wheat grows by its death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As a result of this fellowship, this young student was caught by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>RESURRECTION FOLLOWING DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we sowed a little rock into the earth, that little rock would never die and neither would it grow.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The reason for this is that there is no life in the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Anything that does not have life can never die.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A chair or a statue does not die because neither of them has life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The death of anything is a proof that that very thing has life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Death, however, is followed by resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The New Testament tells us that Christ has resurrected 1 Cor 15:4 and that we Christians all will be resurrected 1 Thes 4:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After the millennium, even the unbelievers will be resurrected John 5:29; Rev 20:5, 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because every man has life, every man will die and be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to the Scriptures, there are different resurrections.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The resurrection of Christ was the firstfruit 1 Cor 15:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then at His coming back there will be another resurrection the resurrection of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After the millennium of a thousand years, there will be the third kind of resurrection the resurrection of the dead and perished ones.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>LIVING TO DIE</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In John 12:24 the Lord Jesus told us that He was a grain of wheat who came to this earth not to live but to die.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord Jesus came to die and He lived to die.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ was born to live and He lived to die.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Luke 12:50 the Lord told us that He was pressed until His death would be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This shows that He expected to die and that His goal was to die.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Word became flesh to die and His death was not an end but an initiation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His death ushered in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Peter, James, and John treasured the Lord as a grain of wheat, and when the Lord Jesus told them that He was going to die, they were bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They were disappointed to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After the Lord told the disciples that He was going to be killed, Peter said, God be merciful to You, Lord; this shall by no means happen to You!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Matt 16:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Peter was satisfied to have the Lord merely as a grain of wheat, but Jesus was not satisfied with this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He wanted to die.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Death was His initiation since through death He entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Death brings in resurrection and resurrection is the issue of life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If the grain of wheat did not have life and if it did not die, it would never resurrect.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because a grain of wheat has life, it dies and this death releases the life in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>THE TRIUNE GOD-MAN</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must see that Jesus Christ was the Triune God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He was not only the God-man, but also the Triune God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The constituents of this God-man were the Father, the Son, the Spirit, and the Man Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He was the Father-the Son-the Spirit-man.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This Man Jesus, who was likened to a grain of wheat, embodied God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When the Man Jesus was put to death, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit with this Man rose up from death.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Man Jesus was the shell of the grain and within this Man, this shell, were the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>While He was dying, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit were growing to rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What can restrict the Father, the Son, and the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What can put the Father, the Son, and the Spirit down?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Nothing!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This wonderful Triune God-man died on the cross and resurrected.</S>
