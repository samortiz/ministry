THROUGH MAN</h2>
<p>We need to consider the humanity of the Lord Jesus because God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is accomplished through man. God cannot accomplish His purpose without man. His eternal purpose is accomplished in man and through man.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s expression of Himself is through man. Man is a God-expressing vessel. Without man, God&rsquo;s expression would not be fully manifested. When the first man failed, a second man came. The second man, Jesus, came to express God. During His thirty-three and a half years on the earth, He was expressing God. Prior to Jesus&rsquo; coming, no one had ever seen God, but when He, as God, came in the flesh, He, as the man Jesus, declared God (John 1:14, 18). This shows that the expression of God is through man.</p>
<p>God also has an adversary, Satan. However, God does not want to deal with Satan from His position as God. If God dealt with Satan in this way, He would be lowering His standing as God. Consequently, He deals with Satan through man. Without man, God is unwilling to directly deal with Satan. When the Lord Jesus was tempted in the wilderness, Satan said to Him, &ldquo;If You are the Son of God, speak that these stones may become loaves of bread&rdquo; (Matt. 4:3). Satan, being very crafty, tried to draw the Lord Jesus away from His position as a man so that He would stand on His position as the Son of God. The Lord Jesus knew of Satan&rsquo;s subtle intention and said, &ldquo;It is written, &lsquo;Man shall not live on bread alone&rsquo;&rdquo; (v. 4). The Lord Jesus came as man to defeat Satan. The greatest threat to Satan was the humanity of Jesus.</p>
<p>Satan tempted the Lord Jesus in the wilderness, and when the Lord Jesus was judged by Caiaphas the high priest, Satan again tempted Him to stand on His position as the Son of God. When Caiaphas said, &ldquo;Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God,&rdquo; the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;You have said rightly. Nevertheless I say to you, From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven&rdquo; (26:63-64). Prior to His crucifixion, the Lord Jesus stood in His position as the Son of Man. When He ascended, He was a man, and in His coming back, He will still be a man. Satan is most fearful of the Lord Jesus in His status as a man because God has chosen to deal with Satan through man.</p>
<p>Two more verses speak of the Lord as a man who has come to deal with Satan. The first verse, Genesis 3:15, indicates that the serpent&rsquo;s head would be bruised by the seed of the woman. Satan&rsquo;s head is bruised by the seed of a woman, and the Lord Jesus, who was born of a virgin, is this seed. God did not come only in His divinity in order to deal with Satan; rather, He came as the seed of a woman, being born of a virgin, in order to bruise Satan&rsquo;s head. The second verse, Hebrews 2:14, says, &ldquo;Since therefore the children have shared in blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner partook of the same, that through death He might destroy him who has the might of death, that is, the devil.&rdquo; Jesus partook of blood and flesh as a man in order to destroy Satan.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus also came as the Son of Man in order to seek and save lost humanity. Luke 19:10 says, &ldquo;The Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost.&rdquo; If the Lord Jesus had not become a man, He could not have become our Savior. God expresses Himself through man, God deals with His enemy through man, and God saves the lost through man.</p>
<p>The importance of humanity can also be seen in the type of the forty-eight standing boards of the tabernacle in the Old Testament. Every one of the forty-eight boards was made of acacia wood overlaid with gold (Exo. 26:15, 29). Each standing board was a product of two natures&mdash;wood within and gold without. The gold without was for the adornment of beauty and the increase of value. The acacia wood within was for the boards to stand. Bible readers know that gold signifies divinity and that wood signifies humanity. The Lord Jesus has both divinity and humanity; He is both God and man. He is a man who has become God&rsquo;s dwelling place. He can stand firmly in the universe and accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal purpose because He is not only God with divinity but also man with humanity. John 1:14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&rdquo; Jesus Christ became flesh; He is the tabernacle of God among us. The standing boards of this tabernacle come from the humanity of Jesus. Jesus is God&rsquo;s dwelling place because of His humanity.</p>
<p>Of the five types of offerings in Leviticus in the Old Testament&mdash;including the burnt offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, the trespass offering, and the meal offering&mdash;the meal offering consisted of fine flour mingled with oil (2:1, 4). In the New Testament the Lord revealed that He was a grain of wheat that would fall into the ground (John 12:24); the meal offering typifies the humanity of the Lord Jesus in His walk on the earth. The meal offering was the daily food for the priests who served in God&rsquo;s presence (Lev. 2:3, 10). Every day the priests ate the meal offering. This typifies our need to take Jesus as our food in our service to God. In other words, we need the humanity of Jesus in our service to God.</p>
<p>God wants to express Himself, and He will do so only through man. God wants to deal with Satan, and He will do so only through man. God wanted to accomplish redemption to save man, and He could do so only through man. Furthermore, God&rsquo;s dwelling place on the earth depends upon humanity, and the humanity of Jesus is our food in our service to God.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Four Men in the Bible &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
