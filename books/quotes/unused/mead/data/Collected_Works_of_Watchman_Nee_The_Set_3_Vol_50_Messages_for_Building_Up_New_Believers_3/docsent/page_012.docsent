   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>NO EVIL WORDS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Peter 3:9-12 says, "Not rendering evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary blessing one another, because you were called to this, that you might inherit blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For he who desires to love life and see good days, let him cause his tongue to cease from evil and his lips to speak no guile.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And let him turn away from evil and do good; let him seek peace and pursue it; for the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears incline to their petition; but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.'"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Another kind of words which should never come out of a Christian's mouth is evil words.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What are evil words?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Evil words are words of reviling, words of cursing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A child of God cannot render evil for evil or reviling for reviling.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A. Learning to</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Speak Words of Blessing</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many people think that they have the right to speak a certain way because others have spoken the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today the world argues about who said what first, but the Lord is concerned about whether or not one has spoken at all.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may ask, "Since others have already said this, can I not say it as well?", but please bear in mind that we cannot render evil for evil or reviling for reviling.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not a matter of who spoke first, but a matter of whether or not you spoke at all.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A new believer must learn to speak words of blessing from the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do not allow reviling or cursing to come out of your mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>B. Controlling One's Temper</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, a person must control his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He must control his temper before he can control his words before God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A person's words are not controlled if his temper is not controlled.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many evil words come out of a person's mouth because his temper is not controlled.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If God's children are not exercised, reviling and filthy words will come out of their mouths.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many people do not know how to control their temper, and their mouths are full of reviling words.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the one hand, these words do not glorify God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the other hand, they deprive a person of any blessing from God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>V. BEING RESTRICTED IN WORDS</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now we come to the fifth point.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to know what we should pay attention to in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>James 3 specifically deals with our words.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Let us read verses 1 through 12.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to find out how God's children should speak.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A. Not Becoming Many Teachers</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse 1 says, "Do not become many teachers, my brothers."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"Knowing that we will receive greater judgment."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The most outstanding characteristic of those who are undisciplined in their words is their desire to be teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Wherever they go, they like to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Wherever they are, they have something to say.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They want to be teachers of others under any circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They can give their lectures free of charge.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many people like to be teachers and counselors.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When they are among others, they always have a great deal to say.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Do you see the problem here?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A Christian must not only stop lying, gossiping, and speaking evil words.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He should not even be wordy at all.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No matter what kind of words he speaks, he is wrong as long as he speaks too much.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As soon as a man speaks too much, he loses all of his blessing before the Lord.</S>
