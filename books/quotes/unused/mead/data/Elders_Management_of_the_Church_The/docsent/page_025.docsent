   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING UPRIGHT IN HEART</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we say that the heart must be upright, we do not merely mean that it should not be crooked.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We mean that there should not be any motive or aim in one's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For the elders to oversee the church, they must have a heart that can say before God that their help to the brothers and sisters and their leading of their spiritual pursuit are with absolutely no motive.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is what it means to be upright.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many times elders visit others with a motive.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sometimes they invite brothers to a love feast also with a motive.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It seems that when they invite a person, that person is supposed to come under their control.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is to have a motive.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is politics.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is not uprightness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we invite others to come to a love feast for fellowship, we should invite them only for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we have some other motive, we should make it clear to them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is to be upright.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the church, and especially with the leading ones and with those responsible for the administration, no one should take advantage of opportunities.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even if an opportunity is available, they should not take advantage of it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Otherwise, their heart is not upright.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For the elders to manage the affairs of the church, their heart must be upright, and their ways must also be upright.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They must not walk a crooked path.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Suppose you are in trouble with a brother and fail to find a solution to the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You may go to this one's brother-in-law to try to have the brother-in-law speak to this one's wife, hoping that she would in turn speak to the brother.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This kind of thing should never be done.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you have the Lord's leading to speak to the brother-in-law, it is a different matter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But if not, you must never act like the worldly people, taking back doors and shortcuts.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I believe after I have spoken all these things, you can understand what I mean.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The elders in the church must learn to enlarge their heart again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is right for one not to be presumptuous, boastful, or desiring to be great.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Yet at the same time, the heart must be enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Meanwhile, the heart must be honest and upright, and you must not try to make use of others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you need someone to help you with something, simply tell the other person plainly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If it is not convenient with the other person, you should not force the issue.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do not skirt the issues, and do not try to make use of others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must deal with our heart before God to such an extent.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Originally, I intended to mention also that the heart must be pure.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We do not need to speak about it now, because purity is included within honesty and uprightness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you can be honest, truthful, upright, and straight, your heart will surely be pure.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>With this type of heart, God will have a way through you; He will be able to use you to oversee the church, and you will become a real profit to all the brothers and sisters.</S>
