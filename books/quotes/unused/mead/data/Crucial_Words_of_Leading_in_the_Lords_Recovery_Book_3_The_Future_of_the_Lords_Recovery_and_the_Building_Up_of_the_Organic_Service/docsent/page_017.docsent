   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>KNOWING THE TRUTH, THE FLESH, AND THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I hope that the younger generation will receive this word and pursue the truth, instead of shouting that they have seen a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some people say that they understand the Bible, but they do not know the truth; they have not labored on the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some people accuse us of teaching heresy, but they do not know the difference between heresy and the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must strive to study the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In addition, we must learn to know the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul preached a Christ who is versus the law, religion, and culture; this Christ is also versus our natural ability and life, our thoughts, the self, and the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to know these things, and we also need to experience the truth that Paul preached concerning Christ as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>LEARNING HOW TO CONDUCT OURSELVES</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>IN THE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since we work for the Lord, we need to learn how to conduct ourselves in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We may go out to preach the gospel in a small town with one thousand families and only eight or nine saints.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How do the eight or nine believers increase to be one hundred believers?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How do we strengthen the church?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to spend time to study and to learn the way to carry this out.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church in Taipei has twenty thousand saints; its needs cannot be met by simply studying the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should also learn how to conduct ourselves when we work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we learn how to conduct ourselves, we will be effective in the work, and we will have good results.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The saints who have dissented and left the Lord s recovery have no way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They have taken the wrong way because they did not know the way to conduct themselves in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They thought that they had seen the vision, and they also criticized the way that we were taking.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It has been only five or six years since they left us, but they have all withered.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we want to have a future in the Lord s recovery, we must learn how to conduct ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord has chosen and called us, but whether or not we will have a future as a Christian depends on our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It does not matter where the Lord takes us or in what circumstances we find ourselves; we should be able to work in such a way that meets the need in our circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord said that we must be as prudent as serpents but guileless as doves.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then we will not harm others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>LABORING IN A PRACTICAL WAY,</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>HAVING NO OPINIONS,</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>AND TAKING THE BODY AS OUR GOAL</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Question: When we fellowship, we feel that we are clear and that we have a way to go on, but after we return to our localities, we gradually lose our clarity, and we do not know what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What do we need to do?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Answer: We must learn to focus on what we do, and we should not analyze whether or not we are able to accomplish a job.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not give ourselves the excuse of saying that we do not understand what we are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should simply work, and there will be a result.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should not say that the church in Taipei is too large and that we do not know what to do; we simply need to work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If our service is to clean the restrooms, we should clean the restrooms so that they are spotless.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we are on meal service, what we prepare should be delicious.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When I was in Chefoo, I took the lead to clean the restrooms, and I cleaned them in such a way that everyone admired them and tried to keep them clean.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should not think that it is easy to be successful in taking care of the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It might not be easy for even the apostle Paul to work in a church as large as the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead of trying to be successful, we simply need to work.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we are asked to speak concerning gospel truths, our speaking should be very clear, attracting, and inspiring.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should not complain and ask why others are asked to give messages to edify the saints, but we are assigned to speak concerning the truth of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should learn to accept in submission and have no opinion concerning any arrangement made by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If the brothers ask us to speak concerning gospel truths, we should do it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If they tell us to clean the restrooms, we should clean the restrooms.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If they assign us to hall one, we should go there.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If every one of us serves in this way, the church will be blessed and strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now that we know to pursue the truth in serving the church, we should not say with fear that we will not know what to do when we return to our localities.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is no need to express our opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should simply present the gospel truths in a good way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need many years of preparation in order to properly present the gospel truths; we cannot prepare overnight.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This can be compared to the ancient Chinese scholars who needed ten years of intensive studies to be successful in the imperial examination.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, we should devote our time and energy to study the area of our involvement in the service.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What we gain from our studies will be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need an attitude of being willing to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For example, if the brothers tell us to sweep the floor of the meeting hall, we should sweep it thoroughly so that it is very clean.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When I was in the church in Chefoo I took the lead to clean the hall.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Even though it was an old house, it was kept spotless and attractive.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Every guest room had a different color scheme.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For example, for the white guest room, every item from the bedding to the decorations was white; for the yellow guest room, every item was yellow.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>At that time, those who were responsible for taking care of the guest rooms were perfected by me.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should always seek to improve so that there is an atmosphere of freshness.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In Chefoo I designed the church s meeting hall, the sisters prayer room, and the brothers prayer room.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, I would often rearrange the furniture in the meeting hall, because I always sought to make improvements.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In this way, when people came into the hall, they would have a sense of newness and realize that we had made improvements.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is the proper way to administrate the church.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we are willing to receive these words, we will be very useful no matter what city or town we go to.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Whether or not we can be effective in a locality depends on our person.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There is a saying that a person can bring life to a dying business if he knows how to manage it.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This principle also applies to a big church like Taipei or to a small church with only eight or nine brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We should never think that we would not have the opportunity to manifest our usefulness if we are in a small town.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Such a concept indicates that we do not understand how to be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we cannot be useful in a small locality, we will not be useful in a large locality.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is not a question of whether we are in a big church or in a small church, or whether we are a full-time co-worker or an elder or a responsible brother in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Do not think that you must be an elder or a co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If you are not a co-worker, you can function as a co-worker; if you are not an elder, you can be as capable as an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Then when you function, you are the same as a co-worker or an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Do not be concerned about whether your locality is small or large, or whether you are a full-timer or a working saint.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>None of these things matter.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We need to see what is the Lord s recovery, what is the Lord s testimony, and what the Lord wants.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Then we can receive a burden from the Lord to give ourselves to Him, to remain under the killing of the cross in order to deal with the flesh, and to walk according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If we are for the Body of Christ in this way, we will spontaneously be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>No matter where we are, we will meet people to whom we can preach the gospel, present the truth, and minister Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When the Western missionaries came to China, they had the Lord s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>They studied the environment and the philosophy of the Chinese people, and they learned the Chinese language.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>They loved the Lord and were determined to labor in spite of sufferings; hence, they had results.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We only regret that the light they saw was inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>However, we cannot deny that their love for the Lord and their spirit for the work exceed our love for the Lord and our spirit for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We are in a convenient environment, but we are not willing to work hard and study our present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>When the Western missionaries were sent by the Lord to China, they had to study Chinese philosophy and psychology; moreover, they studied how to preach the gospel in the Chinese society.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The principle is still the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>There are more than twenty thousand saints in the church in Taipei; hence, instead of expressing our opinions we must study how to work in this situation.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>In the early days in Shantung, there was an American missionary from the Presbyterian denomination who came to our village to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>When people saw him, they said, The blue-eyed, blond man is coming, and they beat gongs so that everyone in the village could quickly shut their doors.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>After studying the situation, this brother stood with a sturdy stick behind a door so that the person inside the house could not see him.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Then when they cracked open the door, he would put the stick in the door and thus enter the house.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Upon entering, he would go directly to their gristmill and push it.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The country people disliked doing the hard work of pushing the mill, so they let him push it.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>But human hearts are not made of iron.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>After he pushed the mill for half a day, they would feel sorry for him and tell their children to give him a cup of water to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Then he would continue pushing the mill until the master of the house would give him something to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Finally, he would sit down to talk with the family.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This was how he opened the door to many households.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>There are innumerable stories like this concerning Western missionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Some spent the night in Chinese homes and were covered with fleabites the next morning.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>As a result, they had to thoroughly scrub themselves before they could enter their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If Chinese people came to visit them, they received them even though they were afraid of getting fleas.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>These were obstacles they faced.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>In some places the Western missionaries were forced to take shelter outside the city walls in the idol temples because the Chinese refused to rent them rooms.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>They suffered tremendously, and yet they still spent their lives for the gospel in China.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>It is worthwhile for us to learn from the spirit of the Western missionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>When we go to a place, we should study the situation there.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>We do not only study the truth; we also care for the practical situation.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Those who are used by the Lord are humble.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>The Western missionaries did many things, but they did not have much light.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>We have seen more light than they saw.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>However, if we merely shout about seeing a vision, express our opinions and the self, yet lack the Spirit and a proper attitude in conducting ourselves, we will bring in many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Those who created problems in the past were the ones with many opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>On the negative side, Paul knew that the self is a problem, so he said, I am crucified with Christ Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>But on the positive side, he showed that Christ is the Spirit and that our goal is the oneness of the Body 2 Cor 3:17; Eph 4:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>We need to remember three points.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>First, we must understand that the self is a problem in the church and in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>When the I is terminated, there are no problems in the church and the work.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Second, our knowledge and experience of Christ are matters in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Third, our goal is the oneness of the one Body, one universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Whether in Shanghai, in Taipei, or in America, there is only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>With only one church, there cannot be many opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>For our flesh and our self to be dealt with, we must be in the Spirit and take the oneness of the Body as our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>We hope that these three basic elements will be in us: the killing of our self, the constant transfusing of the Spirit, and the oneness as our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>We must have the oneness in the church, among the co-workers, and among the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>These three factors must become the basic factors of the church and the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Otherwise, all our training will bring in problems.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Without these three factors, the more training we receive, the more problems there will be.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>A person who learns the lessons before the Lord must observe these factors.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>In conclusion, we must be practical, simple, not express opinions, and take the oneness of the Body as our goal.</S>
