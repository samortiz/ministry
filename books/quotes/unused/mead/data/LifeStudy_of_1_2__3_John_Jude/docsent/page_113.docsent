   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LOVING GOD AND PRACTICING HIS COMMANDMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 5:2 John continues, In this we know that we love the children of God, whenever we love God and practice His commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Loving God and practicing His commandments are the prerequisite of our loving the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is based upon the divine birth and the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 5:2 John speaks of practicing the Lord s commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Greek word rendered practice is poieo, a word that denotes doing things habitually and continually by abiding in the things; hence, it is used in this Epistle in the sense of practice.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This word is used in 1:6; 2:17, 29; 3:4 twice , 7, 8, 9, 10, 22; and here in 5:2.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 3 is the conclusion of this section: For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments; and His commandments are not burdensome.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Greek word for love here is agape, denoting the love which is higher and nobler than phileo.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only agape with its verb forms is used in this Epistle for love.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The love of God here denotes our love toward God, which is generated by His love within us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 5:3 John says that the love of God is that we keep His commandments, commandments that are not burdensome.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Keeping the commandments of God constitutes our love toward Him and is an evidence that we love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Literally, the Greek word for burdensome means heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To the divine life with its capability, the commandments of God are not heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>LOVE AS THE OUTCOME OF THE ENJOYMENT</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>OF THE TRIUNE GOD AS THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In all these verses John is actually speaking concerning the issue of the fellowship of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we are in the fellowship of the divine life, that is, in the enjoyment of the Triune God, this enjoyment will have a certain issue or outcome.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The outcome of the enjoyment of the Triune God is the divine love.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we enjoy the Triune God, this enjoyment issues in the divine love.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Such a result will certainly come out of this enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>With this divine love we spontaneously love others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In particular, we love all those who are organically related to our begetting Father.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have been begotten of this Father, and many others also have been begotten of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we enjoy Him, the result will be that we love all His children.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, loving the brothers is the issue of enjoying the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Triune God as revealed in this Epistle is not only life, light, and love; He is also the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This Spirit dwells in us and moves in us so that we may enjoy the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As we enjoy the Triune God, His essence becomes our being.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a result, we have life, light, and love, and we live by this life and in this light and love.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Spontaneously, we live a life that loves the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is John s thought in this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, when we read 1 John, we may not have this understanding of loving the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may see only that we are told that God is love and that we are charged to love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then in a natural, religious, and ethical way we may try to love others, imitating God s love.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In our nature as human beings there is the tendency to love in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But this kind of love may be ethical, natural, and even cultural.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many have been taught to love others and to be kind to them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many Christians, of course, are under the influence of such teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But these Christians may not see the matter of the anointing in this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They may not realize that within them there is a divine moving, working, and saturating.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They may emphasize teaching, but they may fail to emphasize the inner anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The word anointing is a key word in this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This word implies that today the Triune God is the compound ointment moving within us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This ointment includes the process through which the Triune God has passed: incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the steps of this process are the ingredients of this compound ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The anointing is the function of this ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This means that the function of this ointment is to anoint us with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, the anointing anoints us with the Father, the Son, the Spirit, incarnation, humanity, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, when we are anointed by the moving of the all-inclusive Spirit within us, we are anointed with all these elements.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This means that the different elements of the compound ointment are anointed into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Just as the elements of paint are applied to something that is painted, so the elements of the divine paint, the all-inclusive Spirit, are imparted to our being.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As indicated by the word anointing, the teaching of the apostle John in this book is very subjective and is related to our organic union with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whereas many Christians today emphasize objective doctrine, God s economy, His dispensation, emphasizes the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The anointing within us is saturating us with all that the Triune God is, with all that He has done, and with all that He has obtained and attained.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Although 1 John presents a subjective revelation, those who are preoccupied with doctrine, creeds, and objective belief neglect the subjective revelation, and even condemn us for teaching it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our teaching concerning the anointing may be different from traditional teaching, but it is definitely scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Even if this teaching is different from the traditional teaching, it is not different from what is revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Now that we have covered this Epistle from 1:1 to 5:3, we can see that what is revealed in this book is altogether related to the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need to remember what the anointing is.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The anointing is the moving, the working, the saturating, of the processed Triune God within us to be our life, our life supply, our enjoyment, and our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This anointing, which is fully realized in the fellowship of the divine life, is the subject of this Epistle.</S>
