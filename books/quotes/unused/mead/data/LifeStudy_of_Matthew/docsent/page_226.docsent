   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Disciples to Be Persecuted</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and Hated by the Nations</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 9 says, Then they shall deliver you up to affliction and shall kill you, and you shall be hated by all the nations because of My name.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The you here refers to the Jewish disciples, who were the prophets and wise men sent to the Jews 23:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first martyrs were all Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They were slain not only by the Jewish nation, but by the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Wherever they went, they were persecuted.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many Being Stumbled,</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Delivering Up One Another,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>and Hating One Another</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 10 says, And then many shall be stumbled and shall deliver up one another, and they shall hate one another.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This refers to the believing Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Among the believing Jews, many will be stumbled and deliver up one another.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This indicates that the Jewish Christians will fight against one another and hate one another.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the degradation of the Jewish believers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many False Prophets Arising</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>and Leading Many Astray</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 11 says, And many false prophets shall arise and shall lead many astray.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This began to happen after Christ s ascension and will continue until the end of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Lawlessness Being Multiplied</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>and the Love of Many Growing Cold</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 12 says, And because lawlessness is multiplied, the love of the many shall grow cold.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do not apply this verse directly to the members of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although you may borrow it and use it for the church, the direct application must be to the Jewish believers who have become cold in their love.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>8.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The One Enduring to the End to Be Saved</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although the love of the many shall grow cold, he who endures to the end, he shall be saved v. 13 . Because the Jewish believers are to suffer persecution, they are called upon to endure to the end in order to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They need to exercise their endurance in the Lord and not give up their faith.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To be saved here implies to be saved into the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Suppose, because of persecution and hatred, some Jewish believers are defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Those who are defeated will not participate in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, in this verse, to be saved is not to receive eternal salvation; it is to be saved out of persecution and it is to be saved into the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>9.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Gospel of the Kingdom Being Preached</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>in the Whole Inhabited Earth</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>to All the Nations</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 14 says, And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole inhabited earth for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end shall come.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The gospel of the kingdom, including the gospel of grace Acts 20:24 , not only brings people into God s salvation, but also into the kingdom of the heavens Rev 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The emphasis of the gospel of grace is on forgiveness of sin, God s redemption, and eternal life; whereas the emphasis of the gospel of the kingdom is on the heavenly ruling of God and the authority of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole earth for a testimony to all the nations before the end of this age comes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The gospel of the kingdom is a testimony to all the nations, the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This testimony must spread to the whole earth before the end of this age, the time of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In verses 4 through 14 we see the actual history concerning the Jews from Christ s ascension until the end of this age, the three and a half years of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Before the great tribulation comes, everything in these verses will transpire.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The last item will be the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I believe that the churches in the Lord s recovery will bear the burden to bring this gospel to all the inhabited earth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The gospel of grace has been preached in every continent, but not the gospel of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The gospel of grace is the lower gospel, but the gospel of the kingdom is the higher gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This higher gospel will be brought to every continent through the churches in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This, the strongest sign of the consummation of the age, will take place before the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thus, the most important sign of the consummation of the age is the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom to all the inhabited earth.</S>
