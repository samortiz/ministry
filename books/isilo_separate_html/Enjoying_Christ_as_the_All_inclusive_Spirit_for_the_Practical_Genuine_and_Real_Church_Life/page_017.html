<h1 class="title">LIVING IN THE NEW CREATION<br />
AS THE ULTIMATE ISSUE<br />
OF THE BOOK OF GALATIANS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gal. 6:1, 7-8, 12-18; 2 Cor. 5:17; Eph. 2:15; 4:24; Col. 3:10-11</h1>
<h2 class="head1">AN OVERVIEW OF THE BOOK OF GALATIANS</h2>
<p>Galatians 1 tells us how religion with its traditions is versus Christ and the church (vv. 3-4, 13-14, 15a, 16a), and chapter 2 tells us that the law with its ordinances is in opposition to Christ as our life (vv. 11-13, 19-21). Chapter 3 speaks concerning the flesh and the Spirit. Having begun by the Spirit, we should not try to be perfected by the flesh (vv. 2-3). Rather, we must remain in the Spirit and deny the flesh. Moreover, the promise of the Spirit, which we have received, is the blessing of Abraham through the gospel that was preached to him by God (vv. 8, 14). Following this, chapter 4 reveals that the flesh working together with the law produces children according to the flesh, and the Spirit working through grace produces children according to the Spirit (vv. 21-31), who are sons of God and heirs through God, inheriting all the riches of God (vv. 4-7). In order to be sons of God and heirs of God&rsquo;s riches, we need Christ revealed in us, Christ living in us, Christ put upon us, and Christ formed in us (v. 19). Christ, who is the Son of God, is being formed in us to make us sons of God. In principle, this means that we become the same as Christ. In ourselves we could never be the sons of God; we can only be the sons of the devil (John 8:44; 1 John 3:8, 10). In order for us to be the sons of God, we need to have Christ formed in our inner being to make us the same as He is.</p>
<p>A genuine believer is a son of God, but he may not always bear the image of a son of God. This is because even though he has Christ revealed in him, living in him, and put upon him, he may not have Christ adequately formed in his entire being. For this reason, Paul says to the Galatians, &ldquo;My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you&rdquo; (4:19). Paul&rsquo;s intent was that the Galatians would fully become Christ. Only in this way could they be sons of God in practicality. We may illustrate this by a young man who is the son of a king and the successor to the royal throne. The young man may not yet appear to be a proper heir of the throne. This means that the kingship still needs to grow and be formed within him. Then one day, before he even ascends to the throne, everyone will be able to testify that he is already a king. Many in Christianity hold the teaching that every saved believer will enter into the coming millennium to be the kings in the kingdom. We should not believe this. Even if many were to be given the kingship outwardly, they would not have the inner growth, measure, or stature of a king. We need Christ to be formed in us until we are the same as He is in life and in nature.</p>
<p>Galatians 1 through 4 tells us that we need Christ revealed in us, Christ living in us, Christ put upon us, and Christ formed in us. After this, chapter 5 speaks concerning our need to walk by the Spirit (vv. 16, 25). Christ today is the all-inclusive One dwelling in our spirit. He is one with our spirit, and we are one with Him as the Spirit. Now we need to walk by the Spirit. Then chapter 6 tells us that as we walk by the Spirit, we need to restore a fallen brother in a spirit of meekness (v. 1). This is one example of our Christian service. In our service to the Lord, we must do everything in our spirit. Such a Christian life is a sowing life. Whatever we do, whatever we say, and wherever we go is a sowing. If we sow unto the Spirit and not to the flesh, we will of the Spirit reap eternal life (vv. 7-8). Then Paul concludes this Epistle by telling people that he has nothing to do with the religious world and that neither circumcision nor uncircumcision are anything. Rather, what we need is the new creation (vv. 14-15). If we walk by the Spirit and enjoy the riches of Christ in our spirit, we will spontaneously be a part of the new creation, which is the new man, the church.</p>
<p>In verse 17 Paul says, &ldquo;Henceforth let no one trouble me.&rdquo; Paul did not want to be troubled with the Judaistic religion, circumcision, the keeping of the Sabbath, or any such thing. Then he continues, &ldquo;I bear in my body the brands of Jesus.&rdquo; In the ancient times, when a man was sold as a slave, the buyer marked him with a brand to indicate his ownership over him. For Paul to bear the brands of Jesus indicated that he was the slave of Christ Jesus (Rom. 1:1). From the first day that Jesus appeared to Paul, He branded him with the &ldquo;hot iron&rdquo; of the cross. As a slave of Jesus, purchased by Him, Paul no longer cared for the things of the Judaistic religion. Finally, Paul closes Galatians by saying, &ldquo;The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen&rdquo; (6:18). At this point there is no religion, tradition, laws, ordinances, or the flesh; there is only Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit living in our spirit. Now we must walk and live in this spirit and sow unto the Spirit. Then we will reap eternal life, the totality of which is the new creation, the new man, the church.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> </body></html>
