   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEARNING TO SERVE IN ZHAN-JIANG Newly Arrived in Zhan-Jiang</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Almost six months have gone by since the church in Shanghai sent me here to Zhan-Jiang.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The fruits which I have gained, however, are pitifully few, and the Lord is really dissatisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whenever I consider how I have failed in my responsibility, I have no peace in my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Yes, if I could thoroughly drop the "earth," the Lord could bring the "heavens" out through me.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I have wanted to write you many times, but I was afraid in my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, by His grace I must report the situation of this locality and of myself for His sake and for the sake of His church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thank the Lord that His will is never wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God sent me here to give me more opportunities to learn my lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although I am not faithful enough, God still gives me the grace to be willing to treasure my time here.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I cannot forget your word that these few years will determine my usefulness before God for the rest of my life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I feel more and more that I do not have enough time to do what I should do.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If I do not have enough exercise before Him, I am afraid He will not increase His commission to me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sometimes I am very afraid because most of the people I contact are a generation older than I. Most of them are my superiors.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They are also more educated.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I am afraid to open my mouth to exhort them from a human point of view.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I can only have the boldness to visit them when I rely on the Lord because there is no one else to do this work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When I first arrived, I really wanted to meet some Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>During the first week, I often went to the chapels in this place to talk to the leaders and to attend their meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I was hasty and did the most foolish thing: I "dug into the garbage can" by pointing out errors and unscriptural points to them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>May the Lord's blood cover me, and may He give me grace that I would not do the same again.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Since the Lord wanted me to do the work of recovery, not the work of correction, I did not go to their meetings much after that.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I did not even attend any Lord's Day meetings for several months, preferring to remain alone in my dwelling reading God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God gradually showed me that I must have a new start in the way of "recovery."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There must be a meeting in Siying with a pure standing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The few young brothers that I knew, however, did not know much about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, with much caution I suggested that we meet together.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They were very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since then we have had two meetings every week.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At first I only knew a few brothers, and other people did not know about the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Those who attended the meetings also thought that these were just home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, my goal was not limited to this.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although there were not many people in the meetings, I knew that this was truly a meeting with a pure standing in Zhan-Jiang.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I looked to the Lord to increase the number of those coming to the meetings and to allow all His children in Siying to have the opportunity to attend such meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Unfortunately, some of the brothers who had a seeking heart moved to other localities because they had problems making a living.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There were only two or three people left.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At the same time, I was afraid that others would misunderstand me.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I had to be patient and move slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I did not dare to carelessly invite any brother or sister that I knew to the meetings, lest people say that I was another denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Moreover, I ran into difficulties with the meeting place.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Several times I could not find a place, so we had to meet outdoors.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I preferred doing that rather than borrowing a chapel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because our meeting place was not fixed, I did not dare invite brothers and sisters that I had just met.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Recently, we have begun meeting in my office building, taking the opportunity when my colleagues are out walking after dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thank the Lord, my surveying work in the countryside will be temporarily finished in August, and I will visit the brothers and sisters in this place after office hours.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I have met more than twenty Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The difficulties I have encountered here were not found in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When I was in Shanghai, I was not afraid when I met people because I could invite them to the meetings of the church, or I could ask older brothers and sisters to talk to them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is not so convenient in Zhan-Jiang.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Everything must be done by two or three twenty-year-old brothers who have just joined the work.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Furthermore, there are no church meetings to bring others to, so the only way is to talk to them individually.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If I can only have two families migrating to Zhan-Jiang, one to Siying and one to Chekan, the needs will be covered adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The city of Zhan-Jiang is divided into the two districts of Siying and Chekan that are about twenty kilometers apart.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is a twenty-minute bus ride between the two, but because the people here are poor, not many can afford to take the bus.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If two families would come, many difficulties could be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We could meet in the brothers' houses and have a meeting to remember the Lord on the Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The city of Zhan-Jiang is in a very important location.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is in the southern part of Kwangtung province.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As the most important town east of Kwangsi, Zhan-Jiang is the gateway to that province.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In recent years public safety has improved, and the new railroad is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>According to the head of our department, it will be connected to the railroads in Kwangsi in one year at the latest.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then the rails will run all the way to Kuei-yang and Hengyang.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After the port is opened, the population could easily increase to more than one million.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It has the possibility to become more important than Hong Kong or Canton.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>At present, Siying is a business center.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There are offices for railway engineering, city government, customs, and salt works, as well as elementary and secondary schools, hospitals, and courts.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>My own engineering office has about four hundred employees including more than one hundred engineers .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Many hard-working Western missionaries live in Zhan-Jiang.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>One lived here for more than twenty years and died here.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>His daughter has continued her father's work and remains here.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>However, no other worker has come from among us!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In addition to the Cantonese, there are some people here from other provinces.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Most of the employees in my office were transferred here from the Bao-Tien Railway in the region of Bao-Ji and Lun-Si .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Although more than half are Cantonese, they are able to understand Mandarin quite well.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>My purpose in mentioning this fact is that brothers and sisters from other provinces should not turn away because of a language barrier.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Zhan-Jiang has only two public hospitals, and there is a pitiful shortage of doctors.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>One hospital has only one doctor, who also serves as the director of the hospital.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In addition to these hospitals, there are six or seven private Western doctors in Siying.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>There are five or six secondary schools.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>There are the Customs Office, the Office of Shipping Ministry, the post office, banks, and the Salt Ministry Office.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The brothers and sisters in Shanghai who are employed in these positions could request to be transferred, or they could come here to look for work.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I deeply believe that sooner or later some brothers and sisters from among us must migrate here.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If they come sooner, it would be more helpful to the expansion of the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In my reading of the Bible, I found that the four Gospels have a few places that are different in the order of the events.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Why is this?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Sometimes one chapter speaks of several seemingly unrelated things, and it is difficult to remember them.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>What is the best way to read and remember the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>I really hope that the Lord would give me the opportunity to learn to serve Him by following you.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>There are no older brothers and sisters to teach me here apart from God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If I make a mistake, there is no one to correct me.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>I often feel that this is a suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>I will tell you about the rest later.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Yu Pao-sheng</S>
