   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to the context, truth here denotes uprightness as opposed to evil , which is the reality manifested in a man who lives in God according to what He is, and which corresponds with the divine light, which is God, as the source of the truth, manifested in Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All those who are regenerated are composed together as the corporate bride to match Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Adam and Eve are a type of Christ with His increase.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Adam was a bachelor, a single man, but one day the Lord opened His side, took out a rib, and built that rib into Eve as a wife to match Adam Gen 2:20b-24 .</S>

   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christ is still increasing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In order for Christ to increase, we need to contact people individually to get them regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then gradually and steadily with the proper care, we as their parents should feed, nourish, and cherish them day by day through the small groups.</S>
