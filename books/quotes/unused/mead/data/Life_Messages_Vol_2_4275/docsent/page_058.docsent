   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EPHESIANS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ephesians deals with the issue of a life which lives Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God Dispensed</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This book tells us that the church is the Body of Christ and that it is the fullness of Him who fills all in all Eph 1:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How could the church possibly be His fullness?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is by the unsearchable riches of Christ dispensed into all the members who live Christ out.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The more we live Christ out, the more His riches will be dispensed into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the very next verse after the unsearchable riches of Christ are mentioned, is the dispensation of the mystery 3:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The mystery, therefore, is the dispensation of the Triune God: the Father as the source, the Son as the course, and the Spirit as the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Outcome</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The outcome of this dispensation of the Triune God into His chosen people is the church 3:10 , which is to display God's wisdom "according to the purpose of the ages" 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Have you noticed the sequence in these four verses 3:8-11 ?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The unsearchable riches of Christ in verse 8 are the dispensation of the mystery in verse 9.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The issue is the church in verse 10, which is according to God's eternal purpose in verse 11.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's Eternal Purpose Realized</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Practically speaking, God's eternal purpose is realized by our participating in Christ's riches.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This we do by taking Christ as our life and as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If He is our life and our person, we can say that He lives in us and makes His home in us 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have nothing in common with religion, law, and isms.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our only concern is to take Christ as our life and our person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As we do this day after day, we enjoy all His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This enjoyment is the dispensation of the mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Organic Relatedness</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This way of living issues in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church is not a group of people with the Christian faith who come together to sing hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church is a Body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>My body is not just a few bones stuck together and covered with skin, then dressed in some clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To claim that that is my body is an insult.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>My body is made up of organs, which are organically interrelated.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A group of Christians singing hymns together do not necessarily have any organic relatedness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some Christians could perhaps be likened to a set of dentures, placed in the body but not part of it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Is our relationship to the Body of Christ like that of a set of dentures?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are growing together organically, not placed together by organization.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When those of different nationalities are put together, the relationship is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the church we have many different nationalities and backgrounds.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Nonetheless, we can all grow together!</S>
