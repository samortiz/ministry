   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE WAY TO NOURISH THE NEW CONVERTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH THE WORD OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN THEIR HOME MEETINGS Scripture Reading: Matt 4:4; Jer 15:16; John 6:63; Psa 119:103; Rom 10:12b Lead them to call on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Lead them to masticate the Word by pray-reading the Bible verses quoted in our publications.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Lead them to mingle the Word with prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Lead them to share with others in the meetings what they have received from the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Lead them to give testimonies of their experience.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>USING THE HOMES FOR THE INCREASE</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>AND SPREAD OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have spent much time since October of 1984 to study the matter of the increase and spread of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Until that time the increase and spread in the churches was somewhat disappointing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There had been very little increase or spread for years.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 1962, Taipei had twenty-two thousand members.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By 1984 the number had decreased by fifty percent.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many new ones had been saved, but the total number had not increased.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At the same time we had about a hundred churches in the United States and Canada, yet the number of the saints was very small, not over ten thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since that time, I began to consider the proper way to have the increase and spread, and the Lord began to show me the way of the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the New Testament, when the Lord Jesus ministered for three and a half years, He used people s homes Matt 10:11-13; 26:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even the more, on the day of Pentecost three thousand were added and right away began to meet in their homes, from home to home Acts 2:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This was a new beginning; the meetings in the Old Testament were not carried out in this way Deut 12:5-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to history, the Christian groups which have met in the homes were profited.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because of this, throughout all these months my burden has not been on anything besides the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I consider the homes all day.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I love the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I do not think that in the Lord s new move the big meetings are much needed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>GOING OUT TO GAIN HOMES</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Every brother or sister who would go out to knock on doors for the gospel could establish a home meeting every four weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You do not need to be a job-dropping full-timer to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Take care of your job, but every week spend two to three hours going out.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The best time is on Saturday or the Lord s day.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you went out for two or three hours every week for four weeks, you could gain one home.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If not within four weeks, then at least within eight weeks you could get a home.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means you will get six homes a year.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There are about one hundred twenty thousand saints in all the churches around the globe.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If only one fourth of these saints would mean business to go out to knock on doors, we would gain one hundred eighty thousand homes after one year.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This will increase us not merely by a small percentage, but by one-and-a-half-fold.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Quite possibly each home will bring in two persons; even if each home only has one person, we will still gain one hundred eighty thousand persons.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Yearly we will have a one-and-a-half-fold increase.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even if we only gain half this number, we will still have ninety thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Everybody will be very happy to see this happen.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This would be a seventy-five percent increase.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If within the coming year you would have a seventy-five percent increase in your locality, would you not be happy?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Will you be one of the four going out?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even to speak of a one-and-a-half-fold increase is very conservative.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have a wonderful way to nourish people but if nobody would do it, then what is the use of the way?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It all depends upon our doing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are coordinating and cooperating with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord is ready.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He has been ready for years, simply waiting for our response.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The increase is in the homes, but you must go to knock on doors.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>THE PROPER WAY TO HAVE THE HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To have the home meetings is not to ask others to come to our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Do not ask people to come to you.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To have the home meetings is to take the meeting to them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>First, take the gospel to them, and then take the meetings to them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our former practice of inviting people to our love feasts has not worked.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should rather have food-to-go.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should not invite people to our feast; we should bring our food to their home and put it on their dining table.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the Gospels, God did not merely take the way of inviting.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Rather, God came in the flesh to this earth to seek and to save the lost Luke 19:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He went to the home of Zaccheus 19:1-10 , and in John 4:1-42 He went to the Samaritan woman.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He sent and He gave.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Now we must learn of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Do not remain so high.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Lower yourselves down Phil 2:5-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Come down to reach people where they are Luke 10:33-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>From now on we would not invite people to come to our meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We will send the meeting to their homes as food-to-go!</S>
