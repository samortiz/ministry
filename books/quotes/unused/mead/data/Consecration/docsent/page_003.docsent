   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>4 THE PURPOSE OF CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have just explained that the significance of consecration is the offering of oneself as a sacrifice to God for His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But the New Testament sacrifice, in contrast to the Old, is a living sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Wherever a real consecration to God has taken place, His purpose comes into evidence in the life consecrated to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>That life becomes active for God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our being for God is based on our having offered ourselves to God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we have not presented ourselves as a sacrifice to Him, we shall never be able to do anything for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Only those who have been reduced to nothingness on the altar can serve Him acceptably.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One of the troubles in the Christianity of today is that numbers of Christians who have never allowed God to do His work in them want to devote themselves to work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If Christians offer themselves to work for God without having first allowed Him to do His work in them, trouble will surely follow.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Things would not turn out so badly if they were not too earnest; but if they were really earnest, the result would be that a hundred or so would soon be divided into ten different groups.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Christianity of today does not lack enthusiastic workers, but the church lacks men and women who have first been reduced to ashes on the altar of God and thereafter have become of use to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For the almost forty years of our history, we fellow-workers who have borne the main burden of the work have been able to keep together because, though we have not always seen eye to eye on points of doctrine, we have all to some extent at least learned one lesson, i.e., to let God work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Before taking in hand any work for Him, we have first let Him take us in hand, and thereafter we have undertaken the work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We dare not say that we have had no differences of opinion sometimes they have been quite pronounced ; but we can conscientiously say that everyone has learned something of what it means to be on the altar for God s satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For this reason we have not gotten into difficulty even when we have differed in our doctrinal viewpoint.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we present ourselves to the Lord, we want to remember that the significance of our consecration is that we are a sacrifice to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He wants us to be a living sacrifice, to live for Him and work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then the doing will not be our doing, but His doing through us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>5 THE RESULT OF CONSECRATION</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Brothers and sisters, I wish to tell you that the result of consecration is that all our prospects are cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>True consecration not only ends all worldly prospects; it also ends all prospects in the Christian world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>And it will be put to the test by the Christian world as well as by the non-Christian world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You will be tested by a Christianity where it is possible to be an evangelist of worldwide reputation, or a doctor of divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>My young brothers and sisters, I hope very many of you will become truly useful men and women in the hands of the Lord, but let me warn you of a great snare that lies ahead of you the snare of fame in the Christian world.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>While I was in Manila recently, a group of keen young people pressed me to have a period of fellowship with them each Lord s Day afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some of them were graduates of Eastern universities; others had returned from study abroad.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At the outset I said to them, I am not going to deceive you; I want to tell you the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In all the universe no one wrecks lives like Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>During the past two thousand years I do not know how many young people have had their prospects shattered by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If I were to tell you what splendid prospects you have as Christians, I would be misleading you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rather, let me tell you that Jesus of Nazareth wrecks the lives of all who follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Brothers and sisters, do not misunderstand me when I say that there is no place for natural ambition in anyone whose life has been really handed over to God no future in the non-Christian world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Dare you go this way?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I trust you will test yourselves on the five points we have mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What is the basis of my consecration?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Is it the fact that Christ has bought me?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>And what is the motive power of my consecration?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Is it the constraint of the Lord s love?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And what is its significance?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Is it that I as a sacrifice to God may become food for His satisfaction?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>And is its purpose that of giving Him an opportunity to do as He wills in me, so that I may be able to do a little for Him?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>And has my consecration banished all expectations for this life?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Test yourselves on these five points and see where you really stand in the matter of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I trust you will be faithful to look up the Scriptures on which our statements are based.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Should you come short on any point, you can trust the grace of the Lord to make good what is lacking.</S>

   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Its basis...1 Cor 6:19, 20; Rom 14:8.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Its motive power...Rom 12:1; 2 Cor 5:14, 15.</S>
