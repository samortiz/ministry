<h2 class="head1">THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN<br />THE PRUDENT AND THE FOOLISH</h2><p>Among the ten virgins in Matthew 25, there are five foolish and five prudent. What is the difference between the prudent and the foolish? They are called by the same name, carry the same lamps, have the same goal, hear the same voice, and rise up the same way. The difference between the prudent and the foolish is that the five prudent virgins have oil in their vessels before the bridegroom arrives. The five foolish virgins do not take oil in their vessels and go to buy when the bridegroom arrives. They obtain oil, but do not have it before the bridegroom comes. The time to buy oil has already passed. It is not a matter of having oil or not, but of when they obtain it. Timing is a great matter. Oh, foolish people are those who miss opportunities.&mdash;Selected</p><h2 class="head1">NEWS</h2><h2 class="head2">A Trip to Sian</h2><p>On this trip to Sian, we clearly saw God's presence with us. Before the formal start of the conference, there was a fellowship meeting. We went to observe the condition without any intention of doing anything. While we were sitting there, we had an inward feeling to speak something concerning the attitude of the meeting. Just as I was going to get up, Brother Yu got up. He spoke on exactly the same topic&mdash;the attitude of coming to the meeting. I was inwardly surprised and joyful beyond description. After Brother Yu finished, I continued the speaking. This was the first time I have had such an experience since becoming a Christian. It gave me great faith for the coming work. Thank and praise God. Glory be to God.</p><p>We can say that the problem in the assembly in Sian has been satisfactorily resolved. Today's problem is that there are a few unemployed brothers who cannot find jobs.</p><p>Next week we will go to Lanchow. Are there any special matters in the church in Shanghai? Have the wall and small house on the south side been finished? (All the work is finished.&mdash;Editor)</p><p>Your brothers in the Lord,<br />Yu Cheng-hua, Chu Chen<br />July 29</p><h2 class="head2">Turning Back in the Light of the Word (Sian)</h2><p>The difficulties in the church in Sian have been completely resolved. All but a very few have turned back in the light of the Word.</p><p>There were fellowship meetings for six days this week which began every evening at 7:30. The Lord's Spirit was very strong in these meetings because He wanted to glorify Himself. Many brothers and sisters from other counties came to these meetings to receive the grace. The Lord truly blessed those who sought Him. When our eyes were opened just a little, we could not help but fall on our faces and worship Him in the dust. God is fearsome and awe-inspiring. I dare not say anything here because the way before me is so long. Please pray much for me.</p><p>Brother Chao Xu-dong came to Shensi province from Peking on the ninth of this month. God used him to speak faithful words to the brothers and sisters, and they were well able to receive such words. We see that God is arranging everything from all sides to bless His church. We deeply believe that greater blessings lie ahead of us.</p><p>Liu Xian-zhi<br />July 12, 1950</p><p>Mailing Address: 5 Shihaozhuang, Sian, Shensi province</p>
