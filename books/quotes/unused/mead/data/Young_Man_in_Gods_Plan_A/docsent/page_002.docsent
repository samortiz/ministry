   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE A YOUNG MAN IN GOD'S PLAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Saul of Tarsus was a young man in God's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He was a young man called by the Lord according to the Lord's plan and for the Lord's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Acts 7:58 tells us that "the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man called Saul."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then in Galatians 1:14 Paul tells us that he advanced in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in his race.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"Contemporaries" refers to those of Saul's own age.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>MAN THE CENTER OF GOD'S PLAN</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our God, who is full of wisdom, has a plan, and the entire universe was created according to His purpose, His will, His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must know what God's eternal plan is.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the next chapter we will see more concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Man's position, man's place, in God's plan is very central.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is absolutely right to say that the Bible is a book full of Christ, yet we can also say that the Bible is a book full of men.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even God Himself became a man John 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Jesus is the complete God and the perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even after His resurrection and ascension, He is still a man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Before Stephen was stoned, he said that he saw "the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God" Acts 7:56 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Stephen saw the Lord Jesus as the Son of Man in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Man is the center of God's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A bicycle wheel may have a hub with many spokes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The hub and the spokes subsist in the wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If the hub, the center, is taken away, the spokes will collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In like manner, without man as the center, God's plan would collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>GOD CALLING YOUNG PEOPLE TO TURN THE AGE</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must also see that all the persons who were called by God to carry out His up-to-date move were young men.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This does not mean that God would not use an older person or that God does not love the older ones.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But the Scriptures reveal that all the persons who were called by God were young ones.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You may think that Moses was called by God when he was eighty years old.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But you have to realize that Moses had something divine working within him even before he was forty.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From his very youth, he had something to do with God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When he was eighty, that was not the first time God came to him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God came to him when he was young Acts 7:20-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You may point out that Abraham was seventy-five years old when he was called by God Gen 12:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But if you read the Scriptures carefully, you will see that Abraham was seventy-five years old when his father Terah died in Haran Gen 11:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Acts 7:2 tells us that "the God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The first time God called Abraham was while his father was still alive, and the second call came after his father had died.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, the first time God came to Abraham was quite earlier than when he was seventy-five years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the other hand, we have to realize that at Abraham's time, a man who was seventy-five years old was still quite young.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I would not say that God would never call an older person, but the Bible and church history show that most of the time God has a new move with young people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God calls young people to carry out His move because, generally speaking, young people are not set, settled, or occupied.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>With an older person everything is usually set.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is rather hard for him to have a change within.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Also, everything tends to be settled with an older person.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not easy for him to move on with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Also, older people tend to be occupied by many things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God would not call those who are set, settled, and occupied because whenever He calls a person that means He has something new to do.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He calls someone because He has a desire to turn the age, to do something new and revolutionary</S>
