TO EXPERIENCE CHRIST AS LIFE</h2>
<p>Concerning shepherding new believers to live the Christian life, in chapter 1 we spoke about praying, reading the Bible, meeting, preaching the gospel, fellowshipping with the Lord, consecration, walking according to the spirit, and knowing the anointing. In addition to these items we should lead the new ones to experience Christ as life, that is, to know that Christ is their life. This is to lead them to have a practical Christian life. This is the most important and central matter in our shepherding. The center of the Christian life is in the experience of Christ as life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing That We Are Regenerated</h2>
<p>In order to experience Christ as life, we need to be regenerated. A person who is not regenerated cannot experience Christ, because he does not have Christ as life. When we are regenerated, the Spirit of God brings Christ into us to be our life. In other words, as soon as we are regenerated, the Holy Spirit enters into us and imparts the divine life into us. This life is the life of God, that is, Christ Himself. Hence, Colossians 3:4 says, &ldquo;Christ our life,&rdquo; and Galatians 2:20 says, &ldquo;It is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; These two verses are crucial. When we shepherd new believers, we must open the Bible and ask them to read these two verses, showing them that Christ lives in us to be our life.</p>
<p>We can even take them a step further and tell them that John 3:36 says, &ldquo;He who believes into the Son has eternal life.&rdquo; This eternal life is Christ. The Son in this verse is the Lord Jesus, and to believe into Him means to receive Him. When we believe into the Son, we receive the Lord into us and thereby have eternal life. Theory or philosophy cannot give us eternal life. Only the Lord Jesus in His salvation can be our life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing That Christ as the Life-giving Spirit<br />
Is in Us to Be Our Life</h2>
<p>We must help the new believers see that Christ is not only on the throne, but He is also in us. He is the heavenly Christ on the throne of God, and He is also the pneumatic Christ in our spirit to be our life. Hence, we must point out that Christ is the Spirit. Christ resurrected from the dead, and in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. When He died on the cross, He was the Savior, Redeemer. Now He is the life-giving Spirit so that when we believe into Him, He can enter into us to be our life.</p>
<p>We must help the new believers to see that Christ is the life-giving Spirit to be our life. Otherwise, it will be difficult to lead them to live Christ, to live in the life of Christ, and to experience Christ as life. This is the greatest shortage among Christians. Thousands of believers love the Lord but do not know that the Lord is in them as the Spirit to be their life. As a result, their love for the Lord and their pursuit of the Lord are rather religious. On the one hand, we should stress the fact of the Lord&rsquo;s being the life-giving Spirit to be our life, and on the other hand, our experience of this must increase and become richer.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing That We Have a Regenerated Spirit<br />
and That We Should Walk according to the Spirit</h2>
<p>When we shepherd new believers to experience Christ as life, we also need to tell them that every believer has a regenerated spirit, a spirit that has been enlivened with the life of God. We have given many messages concerning this matter, including messages in the Life-studies of the New Testament. We should read these messages. In particular, we should read the Life-study messages on Romans 8. Then we will be equipped to lead new believers to know, in a brief and concise way, their regenerated spirit. We need to tell them that man is precious because he has a spirit. Man has a body without and a spirit within, and in between is the soul. It is by the spirit that we contact the Lord Jesus, who is the life-giving Spirit dwelling in our spirit. If we want to experience God and take Him as our life, we must be in our spirit and not in our mind.</p>
<p>We can explain further with an illustration. When you argue with someone, you are either in your emotion or in your mind but never in your spirit. The more you are in your mind, the easier it is for you to become angry. Eventually, anger will erupt from your emotion. Therefore, when you want to have an argument or are about to get angry, you should not act according to your mind or your emotion. Instead, you should act according to your spirit. In Romans 8:4 Paul says that we should walk according to the spirit. When we are about to become angry, we should immediately turn to our spirit. When we are in our spirit, we are not in our mind or in our emotion; we are in the Lord Jesus. Since the Lord is the life-giving Spirit, when we are in our spirit, we experience Him as our life. At such a time it is likely that the Spirit will lead us to stop arguing and to go to our room to pray.</p>
<p>The sisters should have this kind of experience when they go shopping. They must follow the Spirit and walk according to the indwelling Spirit. This is to take the Lord Jesus as their life. They should always fellowship with the Lord and pray. In particular, they should pray-read the Lord&rsquo;s word. Pray-reading the Word will help them to turn away from so many people, things, and matters that are outside the Lord and to turn to the Lord. In this way their thoughts, behavior, and chores will be done from the spirit. This is to take the Lord as their life. This is also to experience Christ as life. We need to stress this point again and again. In his Epistles Paul speaks thoroughly concerning this point. In Galatians 2:20 he says that Christ lives in us, and in verse 19 of chapter 4 he says that Christ is being formed in us. In Philippians 3:9 Paul tells us to live so that we may be found in Christ. Paul also says that Christ should be magnified in us so that we can say, &ldquo;To me, to live is Christ&rdquo; (1:20-21). This is to experience Christ.</p>
<p>To experience Christ in this way is to do the will of God. We do not have to focus on doing the will of God. As long as we live Christ, we are doing the will of God. Furthermore, we will be sanctified, overcoming, spiritual, and one spirit with the Lord. Thus, we will remain in the church, participate in the church life, and live in the Body, coordinating and serving in harmony with all the saints. Experiencing Christ as life is the foundation not only of our spiritual life but also of our coordination and service in the church.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> </body></html>
