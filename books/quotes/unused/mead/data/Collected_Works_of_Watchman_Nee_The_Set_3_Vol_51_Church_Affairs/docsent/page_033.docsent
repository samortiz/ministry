   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Supply of the Word in 1 Corinthians 14</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some may ask how we should supply the older brothers, and many other brothers and sisters among us, with the word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the purpose of the Saturday night meeting, the meeting for the exercise of the spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This meeting is conducted according to 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this meeting each one has a word, has a revelation, has a hymn, has a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If today some feel that the meeting for edifying new believers is not sufficient, please remember that every Saturday night you can let several able ministering brothers take care of a stronger and fresher meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every Lord's Day morning we have to preach the gospel and every Thursday we must have the meeting for edifying new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Perhaps every Saturday night we will have an additional meeting according to 1 Corinthians 14, in which we can supply God's children with God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Either one, two, or three can speak.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Saturday night meetings have to be very living, not like today's Lord's Day message meeting, which is maintained in a dead way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today maintaining the Lord's Day message meeting is quite hard even for a worker because if he has a word, he must speak, and if he does not have a word, he still must speak.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is also very hard for a local brother to maintain because, similarly, if he has a word, he must speak, and if he does not have a word, he also must speak.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But if we do not maintain the Lord's Day message meeting today, the brothers and sisters will be scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is as if we use the Lord's Day morning meeting to bind the brothers and sisters together.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I hope that what binds them together from now on will not be the Lord's Day message meeting, but the gospel preaching work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What will bind them together is everyone testifying, everyone preaching the gospel, and everyone saving people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we get them accustomed to working, and they move to another locality, they will feel that they cannot do without the opportunity to work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must give every brother the opportunity to work, lead everyone to have a habit to work, and lead everyone to have a habit to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then we will have a church in a locality that is very stable.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For example, in a locality on every Lord's Day morning, there will be a gospel meeting with different brothers taking turns to be responsible for one or two months with some arrangement before God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That will be a corporate gospel preaching, corporately leading people to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When someone is saved and receives the Lord, you then may bring him to the Thursday night meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After being there for a year he will have received his basic edification.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those who are burdened for the word and those who have a burden before God and are not passive will stand up on Saturday nights to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Everyone Being Responsible</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today there are many localities where the Saturday night meetings cannot be strong because all the brothers are passive, even though many are gifted with a ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If there is no pressure on them, as with the Lord's Day meetings which force them to go before God, then every Saturday night meeting will be a time to relax.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If all the brothers relax, bearing no responsibility, how can the meeting be strong?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If no one bears the burden, how can the meeting be strong?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not allow anyone to be passive!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Who then would take the initiative?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The meeting according to 1 Corinthians 14 is not a meeting where everyone shirks responsibility; the meeting in 1 Corinthians 14 is a meeting in which everyone bears responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For one person to bear the responsibility is wrong; for no one to bear the responsibility is also wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Having Half an Hour of Prayer</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>and Preparation Beforehand</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now I want to talk about how the responsible brothers in each locality should carry out the Saturday night meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Saturday night meetings are the same as the other meetings in that the responsible brothers should pray together.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Before every meeting the responsible brothers should arrive at least half an hour early to have some prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It should be the same with the gospel meetings, the meetings for edifying new believers, the prayer meetings, and the bread-breaking meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The responsible brothers should always be there half an hour or fifteen minutes early to have some prayer and preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Especially for the Saturday night meetings, you may need a little more time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You should usually arrive fifteen minutes early, but for this meeting you need to arrive half an hour early.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You have to ask the responsible brothers to come for half an hour of prayer first, and then you need to help them to the extent that even if others have not prepared, they would be prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The responsible brothers can enter into the meeting only when they have the assurance before God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There should be no responsible brother who can simply remove his hat and rush into the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Every responsible brother must first have some preparation before he can go in.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There are many localities with many unspiritual persons who want to occupy the podium.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You need to pray much for them so that they would not come in and control the podium.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Those that enter in should be the ones who have a genuine burden before God, those who are fearful of having a poor meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hence, you need to pray beforehand and then take good care of the meeting so that it may be uplifted.</S>
