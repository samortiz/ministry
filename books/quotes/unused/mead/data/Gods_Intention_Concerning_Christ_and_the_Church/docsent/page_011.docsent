   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR A PROPER CHURCH NEEDING TO BE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FILLED WITH LIFE AND TO BE INCLUSIVE THE REALITY OF THE CHURCH BEING CHRIST AS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church is not an organization but an organism, a body the Body of Christ Eph 1:22-23; Col 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As such, the church has the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although the church has the divine life, the life of the church must be healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, it is not enough for our physical body to simply have life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many people have life in their body, but their body has lost its health and is sick.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In addition to having life in our body, we need the life in our body to be healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our physical body is a picture of the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The way for the life of the church to be healthy is for the church to be filled with the experience of Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Without the experience of the life of Christ, the church has no health or reality.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The reality of the church is the life of Christ; the life of the church is Christ as life Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can never overstress the fact that the reality of the church is Christ Himself as life to every member of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, if we study the situation of Christianity, we will find that although this truth is so critical, it has been almost entirely ignored.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I have studied church history and have read a number of biographies of believers from the past centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In addition, I was born among Christians and was brought up and educated in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I have learned much concerning the Scriptures from other Christians, and I have visited Christians in China and in many countries outside of China.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Through all of this I have discovered that it is very difficult to find anyone ministering on the matter of Christ being life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In many places you will find groups of Christians who meet on the Lord s Day, and among these Christians there will be some who minister the Word and give messages.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, although one may be able to hear many messages, it would be very difficult to find one message on the subject of Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There would likely be a great amount of teaching, doctrine, and knowledge but very little concerning knowing Christ as life in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you visit the churches in the fundamentalist movement, you will discover that they are for the most part fundamental in knowledge but not in life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If they were fundamental in life, they would be more living.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>With life there is always an impact.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is true with all forms of life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord said in John 12:24 that when a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it grows up and bears much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Fruit-bearing is the impact of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, if you visit the fundamentalist churches in the United States, there is for the most part no fruit and no impact.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From this we can conclude that these churches are fundamental in their teachings but not in the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many dear believers in the United States have the Scofield Reference Bible in their hands.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I am not against the use of this Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In fact, when I was young I took a correspondence course with the Moody Bible Institute that used the Scofield Reference Bible, and I received much help from it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This Bible has greatly helped some to know the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, for most of them this knowledge has not resulted in the real experience of Christ in their daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They have used this Bible to acquire knowledge with their minds, but they have remained on the line of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As a result, most of the believers in this country are very weak.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whereas the believers in the fundamental churches are focused on knowledge, those in the Pentecostal movement are preoccupied with something other than knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They are focused on power and release, but these things are not life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, their experience of life is also very limited.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Their mistake is that they confuse power with life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should never neglect the history of Christianity, because this history contains the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to study this history and observe the present situation in an objective way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should not be too subjective in studying and observing the present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we visit the Assemblies of God or other branches of the Pentecostal movement, we will realize that although they have much release, they have very little life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They have much power but very little reality of Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to face this fact.</S>
