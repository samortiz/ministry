   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Third Stage of the Experience of</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Presence of the Resurrected Pneumatic Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>through the Valley of the Shadow of Death</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The third stage is the stage of the experience of the presence of the resurrected pneumatic Christ through the valley of the shadow of death Psa 23:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even though we walk through the valley of the shadow of death, we do not fear evil, for the pneumatic Christ is with us 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that we experience His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For Him to be with us is for us to enjoy His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His presence is a comfort, a rescue, and a sustaining power to us when we are walking in the valley of the shadow of death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We human beings cannot avoid having troubles as we live on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A husband's wife who takes care of him and the children may suddenly become so ill that she is unable to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then this brother gets into the valley, which is under a shadow and full of death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some saints may have children who are crippled.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This brings these saints into the valley.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A brother may be an elder in a locality, and the Lord may suddenly bring in another elder, with whom it is difficult for this brother to coordinate.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This other elder then becomes the valley of the shadow of death to the first elder.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He cannot quarrel with this other elder, or he will offend his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He has to keep the one accord with him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Also, his spirit will not allow him to withdraw.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He has to stay in the valley to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These are examples of the valley of the shadow of death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>About five years ago, I was put into a valley.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 1987 I was working in Taipei, laboring day and night on the Chinese Recovery Version of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then at the end of 1987, I returned to the United States and realized that there was turmoil present among us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>During this rebellious turmoil, I was put into a valley.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we are in the valley, the best way for us to deal with it is to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The tests in the valley always tempt us to do something so that we can come out of the valley.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But the more we do, the more the valley extends.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We just need to be quiet, to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our resting in the Lord will shorten the valley, reduce the shadow, and remove the death.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not talk about our being in the valley.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The more we talk, the wider the valley becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The best way is for us to forget that we are in the valley, because we have the Lord with us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We do not fear evil, because He is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Second Timothy 4:22 says that the Lord is with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord is not merely within us in a general way, but He is in our spirit in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we have had the proper experience in the valley, we can testify that it was a place for us to enjoy the Lord's presence in such a close way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In 1943 there was a big revival in the church in Chefoo, my hometown in mainland China.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At that time we were under the invasion of the Japanese army.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They were wondering how I could draw so many people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They studied me secretly for a few months, and then in May of 1943, they came to get me.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They brought me to their military police headquarters, and I was put into prison for thirty days.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>That was a real valley to me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Japanese invading army killed thousands of Chinese during the war, so I could have been killed by them at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I was under their threatening and torture for two three-hour sessions a day.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One day they put a young Greek man into the prison cell with me.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He and I both spoke a little English, so we could communicate with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Japanese did not know this.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One day they purposely decided not to give me any food.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One of them came to me and, not being able to speak Chinese, he pointed up to the heavens, indicating that I should ask my God to give me food.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The young Greek man, however, insisted on sharing his food with me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He and I became intimate friends.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After a few weeks, he was taken away, and I was left alone in my imprisonment.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>One day when I was alone, as I was praying, I had a deep sense that the Lord was there with me in a special, intimate way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I was in the valley, and the Lord caused me not to fear any evil.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Eventually, I was preserved and protected by the Lord from being harmed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After thirty days, the Japanese released me.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>That was a real experience and enjoyment of the Lord's presence in the deep valley of the shadow of death.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the valley of the shadow of death, the Lord's rod and His staff His protection, His guidance, and His sustenance comfort us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The rod is for protection.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If a wolf comes, the shepherd uses his rod to protect the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The staff is for training, for direction, for guidance, and also for sustenance.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord has the rod to protect us, and He has the staff to train us, to instruct us, to guide us, and to sustain us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We experience the Lord's protection and guiding in the valley of the shadow of death.</S>
