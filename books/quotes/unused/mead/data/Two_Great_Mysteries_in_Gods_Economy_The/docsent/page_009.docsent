   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Spirit of Man</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Then we have the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is hard to tell.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you check with the thoughtful people, every one realizes that there is an emptiness within man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is this emptiness?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is the appetite.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The appetite is a kind of hollowness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have such a hollowness within us which is the desire for eating, and this desire is termed the appetite.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every thoughtful person realizes that besides the physical appetite there is another kind of appetite.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After a man is filled up with the best food, he feels strongly that something within is still so empty.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Regardless of whether we are old, young, rich, poor, high, or low, with every human being there is the sense of emptiness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After animals fill up their hunger, they go to sleep; they do not have any other appetite.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When all the monkeys, tigers, and lions in the zoo are filled up, they are satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But the more human beings are filled up physically, the more they become hungry within.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the very reason why religions have become so prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Strictly speaking, on this whole earth among the human race there is not one atheist.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All the atheists are self-deceivers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In their mentality they say that they do not believe that there is a God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>While arguing with you that there is no God, deep within they ask, "Suppose there is a God, what should we do?"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When they return home to their bedroom, they would think that probably there is a God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They would think, "I should not run the risk to say so strongly that there is no God."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This proves that there is not one real atheist.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All the atheists are liars.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They lie to themselves because, in fact, every human being has an appetite other than the physical appetite.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is this appetite?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is a deep desire after God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every human being has something within him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whether we call that the spirit, the appetite, the receiver, or the hollowness, whatever we call it, there is such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE TRIPARTITE MAN SPIRIT AND SOUL AND BODY</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is such a thing called the human spirit within every human being.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God created us in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Genesis 1:26 says, "And God said, Let us make man in our image."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God did this in the way of forming a physical body with the dust.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our physical body is just dust.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is a composition of chemical elements such as salt, sulfur, copper, iron, and other things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God formed a physical body with the dust.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then God did something which He had not done with any of the animals.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God breathed something into man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Here we have two kinds of materials the dust and God's breath.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The dust was used as material to form man's physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Besides this, He breathed the breath of life into man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to be clear that this was not God's divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This was just some breath out of God's mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After this breath entered into man's dusty body, man became a living soul.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>So in Genesis 2:7 we have the body formed with the dust and the soul as an issue that came out of the combination of God's breath and the physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now we have the body and the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>No doubt the breath of God which was breathed into the physical body is the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the original Old Testament text, the word for breath in Genesis 2:7 is the very word in Proverbs 20:27 which is translated in the English version as spirit, the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The spirit of man is just the breath out of God's mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The dust with which our body was formed is a material matter, but the breath which is the very element for our spirit is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>So we have two kinds of elements.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>One is the material element, the dust for the body; the other is the spiritual element, the breath of God for our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When this breath comes into the dusty body, the issue is the human soul.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In this one verse Gen 2:7 we have these three things the body, the soul, and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>So the Apostle Paul told us clearly in 1 Thessalonians 5:23 that a human being is composed with three parts the spirit and soul and body.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have a body, a spirit, and a soul.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God created us this way with a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Just as a jacket was designed to fit the physical body, so man was made, not by accident but according to God's design.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Man was made according to God's fashion with a soul, and the soul is of three parts: the mind, the emotion, and the will.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>How wonderful is man's mind!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The mind can remember so many words and syllables.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The mind also works with the will to make decisions and choices.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The emotion, being our inner organ to love, to hate, to be happy or sorrowful, goes along with our mind as well.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>These three the mind, the emotion, and the will all go together.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, man has a deeper organ called by the Bible the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This organ is solely, wholly, and simply for us to receive God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The little receiver within a radio is made purposely for one thing to receive the electrical waves in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We also have such a single-purposed organ within us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>That is our spirit to receive God as the spiritual waves from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>After we were born, we did not use our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We used our body in bodily exercise and our mind for education and schooling, but we were never taught to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is a new language, yet this has to be used in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Sometimes a brother and his wife quarrel and exchange words.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Both should just be quiet and exercise their spirits!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Do not charge the other party to exercise their spirit; you just do it.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Bible says that the very God is the One who stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man Zech 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This word shows us that three things are crucial in this universe the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man with his spirit is for God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is altogether for God's economy, so the Bible says that there is a spirit in man.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It goes on to tell us that the spirit of man is the lamp of God Prov 20:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We all know that the lamp here refers to an oil lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The lamp itself does not give light; it is the oil that burns within the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>God is the oil, and our spirit within us is the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>As the oil burns to shine through the lamp, so God shines through our spirit.</S>
