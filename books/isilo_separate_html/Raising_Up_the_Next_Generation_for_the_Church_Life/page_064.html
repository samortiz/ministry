<h1 class="title">BUILDING UP A PREVAILING<br />
CHILDREN&rsquo;S WORK IN THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 127:3; Heb. 11:7; 2 Tim. 3:15; Eph. 4:7-16; Rom. 16:1, 12-13; 1 Tim. 4:12; Judg. 5:15-16; Dan. 11:32; 1 Cor. 12:14-22</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>We expect the children&rsquo;s work among us to be very prevailing; therefore, we need to have a proper realization and preparation for this work&mdash;Gen. 1:28; Psa. 127:3:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When we speak of the children&rsquo;s work, we are referring to children who have not graduated from elementary school but are more than five years old; these are the target of our children&rsquo;s work.</li>
	<li>The saints can open their homes for children&rsquo;s meetings; we need many brothers and sisters to open their homes; how beautiful this service will be, and how much the Lord&rsquo;s work will be propagated!&mdash;Acts 2:46; 6:7a.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The responsible brothers and the co-workers in every place must see the importance of the children&rsquo;s work in God&rsquo;s family; this should be a great matter to us&mdash;Heb. 11:7; Psa. 127:3; Gen. 33:5b; Dan. 1:3-4; Matt. 24:45; 25:16; Rom. 9:23; 2 Tim. 3:15; 1 Tim. 3:4-5; Acts 16:31-32; Eph. 4:12-16; 1 Tim. 4:12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>No family will disregard its children; as a priority a family looks after its children, raises them, and teaches them; hence, we must serve the many children in God&rsquo;s family&mdash;Psa. 127:3; Eph. 6:4; Matt. 19:13-14.</li>
	<li>The co-workers do not need to be personally involved in doing the children&rsquo;s work; they can meet with the leading sisters in a locality and entrust the burden for the children&rsquo;s work to them, and they can encourage them&mdash;Phil. 1:1c; Rom. 16:1, 12-13.</li>
	<li>The elders must lead the church to receive a burden for the children&rsquo;s work; the church should concentrate its effort on this work&mdash;1 Tim. 2:1-4; Gal. 1:4; 1 Thes. 2:7-11; Rom. 10:17; Acts 16:31-32.</li>
	<li>All the churches must have a children&rsquo;s work; if we work with these children, they will all be young brothers and sisters after six to seven years&mdash;Eph. 4:12-16; Zech. 4:10; cf. Matt. 25:16.</li>
	<li>We cannot continue to work as we have in the past; we must change our ways; in the past we neglected the work with the children.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In carrying out this work, first, a number of sisters should rise up to lead the children&rsquo;s work; the elders should also appoint some sisters to take up this responsibility&mdash;Rom. 16:1, 6, 12-13; Mark 15:41:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>A number of older sisters must receive this burden; over ninety percent of the children&rsquo;s work requires the sisters&rsquo; participation; otherwise, there is no way for the children&rsquo;s work to succeed&mdash;1 Tim. 5:2a; cf. Col. 4:17.</li>
	<li>The sisters in every church should be persistent to promote the burden for the children&mdash;cf. Luke 18:1-8; 1 Sam. 1:11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>On the one hand, they should not give the brothers any peace, and on the other hand, they should learn not to assume the leadership but to be full of patience, knowing when to proceed and when to wait&mdash;1 Cor. 11:3; John 7:6; Matt. 15:21-28.</li>
		<li>The sisters should be persistent to develop the children&rsquo;s work in the church; furthermore, according to the leading of the Lord, they should fellowship with other sisters who are serving&mdash;1 Cor. 15:10a; 1 John 1:3, 7; 1 Cor. 12:21-22.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The sisters should also bring the children to the meeting; every week the sisters should consider how to bring the children to the meeting.</li>
	<li>We must use the young sisters to lead the children&rsquo;s meetings; the church should train the teachers so that the young sisters learn to teach and lead the children&mdash;2 Tim. 2:2.</li>
	<li>Many of the sisters love the Lord, but they need to find the way to do something for the Lord; if we bear the little ones as fruit, the Lord will add them to our account&mdash;Matt. 25:14-30; 2 Pet. 1:8; 1 Thes. 2:19:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Only eternity will reveal the result of this; perhaps out of a group of children for whom we are caring, some will become apostles&mdash;2 Tim. 3:15; 1:2; 1 Cor. 4:17.</li>
		<li>Therefore, I encourage the sisters to do this good work; all the housewives can bring children to the meetings, and the younger sisters can be trained to cooperate with them to bear these little ones as fruit.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We also need the help of the young people in the children&rsquo;s work; this matter must be developed&mdash;1 Tim. 4:12:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>There is quite a large number of children in every locality; as soon as we begin the children&rsquo;s work, the young people will begin to function; they can all take part in serving the children:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We can ask the brothers in the church to perfect the junior high and high school brothers and sisters to assist in teaching the children.</li>
		<li>With regard to the children&rsquo;s work, even though the junior high and high school students can teach in the children&rsquo;s meetings, the children&rsquo;s work will be carried forward by the full-timers, because they will prepare teaching materials and make a schedule.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The young people need to give themselves to this work, and this will give everyone an opportunity to practice speaking.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The elderly saints may use their homes; after the children get off from school, the elderly saints may open their homes and prepare some snacks to welcome them:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>They may sing with the children, tell them stories, and lead them to know God.</li>
	<li>Gaining people in this way is very safe, because they are taught by us and receive the gospel from us from their youth; thus, they should be very solid.</li>
	<li>I hope that from now on the elderly saints would pick up the burden and take the lead to do this in their homes; the effect will be very promising in the long run.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>When the entire church is mobilized in this way, all the brothers and sisters will have an opportunity to serve; some can open their homes, others can bring the children to the meetings, and still others can teach the children; when all the saints endeavor in one accord for the Lord&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire, the profit will be immeasurable&mdash;Judg. 5:15-16; Dan. 11:32; 1 Cor. 12:14-22; Eph. 4:7-16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We should take action immediately; all the churches should encourage the saints in this matter, and we should pray for this matter&mdash;Judg. 5:15-16; Dan. 11:32; 1 Tim. 2:1.</li>
	<li>All the saints want their children to receive spiritual help; even dormant saints want their children to receive spiritual guidance.</li>
	</ol></li>
