Many Christians today are still in the outer court; they have not yet come into the Holy Place. Praise the Lord that through the death of Christ we have come into the Holy Place where we enjoy the supply of Christ, the enlightenment of Christ, and the acceptance of Christ! However, even though we enjoy all this, this does not mean that we enjoy Christ Himself. Rather, it means that we enjoy something of Christ, for example, the nourishment of Christ. But to enjoy something of Christ is different from enjoying Christ Himself as that thing. For instance, to enjoy the nourishment of Christ is not the same as enjoying Christ as nourishment. Yes, the Holy Place is a good place, and we should praise the Lord that we are able to be here. Nevertheless, the Holy Place is not the best place. There is an inner chamber, the Holy of Holies, which is much better than the Holy Place.</p><p>Have you entered into the Holy of Holies? Along with most Christians, you will probably have to admit that you have not yet come into the inner chamber. The reason you have not yet entered the Holy of Holies is that although your sins have been forgiven, your flesh remains untouched. It is still the same. Therefore, you need the death of Christ not only for your sins, but also for your self. According to 1 Corinthians 15:3, Christ died for our sins. But according to 2 Corinthians 5:14, Christ died for all, not merely for the sins of all. This verse says clearly that Christ died for us. Christ died for our sins so that we may be forgiven, and He died for us so that we may live to Him. There is a great difference between being forgiven of our sins and living to the Lord.</p><p>Second Corinthians 5:21 says that Christ became sin for us. From Romans 8:3 we learn that sin is in our flesh. This verse declares, &ldquo;God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh.&rdquo; Furthermore, according to 2 Corinthians 5:21, Christ became sin so that we may become the righteousness of God.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO ASPECTS OF CHRIST&rsquo;S DEATH</h2><p>If we would understand this matter, we must realize that there are two aspects to Christ&rsquo;s death. On the one hand, He died for our sins so that we may be forgiven; on the other hand, He died for us so that we may be terminated. God&rsquo;s judgment upon us is signified by the brass sockets under the five pillars supporting the screen. The veil which was rent at the time of Christ&rsquo;s death indicates that Christ died for us so that our flesh might be torn and that we might live Him. On the one hand, Christ died for our sins under God&rsquo;s judgment. On the other hand, He died for us so that we may be terminated.</p><p>We have pointed out that the revelation of the tabernacle is not merely according to doctrine, but also according to spiritual experience. First we experience Christ as the One who died for our sins. Realizing this aspect of Christ&rsquo;s death, we may come into the Holy Place, where we can be nourished and enlightened and where we can pray with Christ as our incense. For a long period of time, perhaps years, we may be satisfied. But eventually we shall realize that we should not be content simply to be in the Holy Place. There is an inner chamber into which we must enter. However, because we are still in the flesh, we cannot come into the Holy of Holies. When we realize that we are still in the flesh, we need to see that Christ died not only for our sins, but also for us. When He died for all, we died with Him. When He was terminated on the cross, we were terminated also.</p><p>Now we can see why there were two veils in the tabernacle. Both veils signify the unique Christ, the Christ who died for our sins and also for us. He was judged by God for us, and He was terminated with us. Therefore, through Him we have been judged. God forgives those whom He judges. God forgives us so that we may enter into the Holy Place of His dwelling. Furthermore, God looks upon us as terminated persons, as those who have been put to death so that they may live another life in the Holy of Holies of His dwelling.</p><p>Suppose a sinner hears the gospel and comes to the altar in the outer court. At the altar he receives Christ as his Redeemer, as the One who died for his sins. Immediately he passes through the curtain supported by the pillars in the brass sockets. This means that he passes through the Christ who is supported by the judgment of God. Now this redeemed sinner can come into the Holy Place and enjoy the supply of Christ, the life of Christ, and the sweetness of Christ as His acceptance. Eventually, after a certain time, he comes to realize that Christ died not only for his sins, but died also for him. Now he understands that on the cross Christ not only was judged by God for him, but also was killed and terminated with him. This means that when Christ died, the redeemed one died with Him. Moreover, as a terminated person he should experience the rending of his flesh. This means that, according to Galatians 5:24, he should crucify the flesh. This is to have the veil torn and thereby experience Christ&rsquo;s subjective death in dealing with the flesh.</p><p>The outer veil signifies Christ&rsquo;s objective death. Christ died for our sins in an objective way. But the inner veil signifies Christ&rsquo;s subjective death. When Christ died, He died with us, and we died with Him. Now we need to realize that we are terminated persons. As such, we should no longer live to ourselves, but instead should live to Christ. Then immediately, we shall no longer remain in the Holy Place; we shall enter into the Holy of Holies. In the Holy of Holies we not only enjoy certain things that are of Christ; we enjoy Christ Himself as everything. We experience Christ as God Himself embodied in humanity shining forth the divine nature.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_340.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_342.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Exodus &nbsp; pg 341</div><br></body></html>
