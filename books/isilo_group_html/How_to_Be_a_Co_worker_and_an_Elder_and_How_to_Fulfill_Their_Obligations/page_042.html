Not Living with Christ</H2><P>The co-workers and elders also have to beware of not living with Christ, not walking, working, and moving with Him. Many people walk, but not with Christ; they work, but not with Christ; and they move, but not with Christ. Yet they acknowledge that Christ dwells in them. Surely, Christ is dwelling in us, but we often ignore Him. I do not know how many times I have confessed my sins to the Lord, saying, "Lord, I just made a phone call, but I didn't do it with You." The proper thing to do is to say, "Lord, now I am going to make a phone call. I desire that You make this phone call with me and that I make this phone call with You." How beautiful this would be! Sometimes I felt that my wife had a shortcoming in a certain aspect. Then I prayed, "Lord, I want to fellowship with her. Please go with me. If you don't go with me, that means You don't want me to do it; then I won't do it. If You want me to do it, You have to do it with me and I with You." This is my experience of living with Christ in my personal life.</P><P>In a newly written hymn there are these two lines: "No longer I alone that live,/But God together lives with me." Our daily life must be "God together lives with me." We cannot just say this in our prayers and sing this in our hymns, and not live together with God day by day. We are too free. If we want to make a phone call, we do it instantly. If we want to write a letter, we do it immediately. We are short of the experience of living with Christ. Often, as soon as I left my seat to go and do something, I had to sit down because I was going alone without the Lord; I had to ask the Lord to forgive me for acting alone. Consider as a Christian how many things you have done by yourself alone and not by you with the Lord. To be a co-worker you have to do everything in the work with the Lord; to be an elder you have to do everything in the eldership with the Lord; even to shepherd the brothers and sisters you have to do everything with the Lord. The Lord is our Chief Shepherd and our great Shepherd. It must be He who is in us urging us to shepherd others. Unless the Lord is doing the shepherding, how can we be shepherds? When we go to visit a brother and the Lord goes with us, that truly makes a difference.</P><P>When you go to visit a brother, you must have the Lord going with you. You must not go simply because you have the burden and the willingness to go. If you go in this way, your visiting will be futile. You do not have the Spirit, the life, or the Lord; you are acting alone. Before you go, you must pray to the Lord, "Lord, I pray that You would give me a real burden to visit this brother. I am in fear and trembling before You, Lord. I am afraid of bringing myself there to visit him. Have mercy on me, Lord. If You do not go with me, I will not go. You must go with me. Also, enable me to speak with You, and You must speak with me. Although I am a shepherd to this brother, I want to take You as my Shepherd. Unless You shepherd me, how can I shepherd him?" If you do this, you are one who lives entirely with Christ. You are not in the old creation but in the new creation in resurrection. Hence, when you go, the sensation, the flavor, and the atmosphere that you give him are simply Christ. This is to minister Christ, to dispense Christ. Otherwise, dispensing Christ and ministering Christ become mere terminology that is found in our messages and hymns but is rarely seen in our daily life.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_041.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_043.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>How to Be a Co-worker and an Elder and How to Fulfill Their Obligations &nbsp; pg 42</div><br></body></html>
