   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BEST WAY TO EAT CHRIST BEING TO PRAY-READ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Therefore, our conclusion is that to be a good and living Christian, one must eat every day.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you want to be strong and healthy, you have no alternative but to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, do not eat in a haphazard way; you must eat properly, and you must also eat at the right time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I speak this word especially to the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I know that without exception you all are busy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Actually, everyone is busy; no one is sitting idle.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Satan will not allow anyone to sit idle.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is needless to mention that you are going to school or doing a job; even if you do not do these things the whole day, you will still be busy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, do not let your busyness be your excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rather, you should remove the word busy from your human life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Young people, I advise you to save the time you spend on making telephone calls for gossiping.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That will give you plenty of time for reading the Word and eating the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Actually, this does not require very much time; half an hour a day is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we eat our meals, we should eat properly, not irregularly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For instance, I set a schedule to eat three times a day breakfast, lunch, and dinner and I stick to the schedule firmly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Likewise, when you come to eat the Lord s word, you must have a definite schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It should not be that you eat when you are happy, and you do not eat when you are not happy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rather, you eat when you are happy, and you eat even when you are not happy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, do not be selective in what you eat.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You need to read the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The best thing to do is to have a daily reading of some portions from the Old Testament and some from the New Testament in sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Begin with the first chapter of Genesis in the Old Testament and with the first chapter of Matthew in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Obedient children eat whatever their mother serves, and they grow to be healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But those who are choosy in their eating are usually not healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I hope that you will receive my little word of exhortation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am telling you my experiences over scores of years.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I am speaking to you not according to theology or to the teaching of Bible teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rather, I am speaking to you according to the Word of God and from my experience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You all must know that the Word of God and the Spirit of God are two great means.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God gives Himself to us by means of His Spirit and His breathing out.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He breathes out and we must breathe in. We breathe in by praying.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The best and surest prayer is to use the Lord s words as your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You do not need to study hard as to how to pray; the entire Bible is your prayer book.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You can read a sentence or a verse, and then you can pray these words.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the best prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When you pray, neither be too rigid nor always fluctuating.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First you must use your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Contact the Lord with your spirit, and ask Him to cleanse you with His precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whenever you contact the Lord with your spirit, you will feel the need for His blood to cleanse you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You may not feel that you have sinned, but you are still defiled because you are still in the old creation, in the flesh, and in the self.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even though we have not sinned, and even though we have not done anything wrong or thought anything wrong, we are still the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Since we are the flesh, we need the cleansing of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As those who are of the old creation, we are filthy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, every time you come to contact the Lord by reading His word, first you must pray, O Lord, cleanse me with Your precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The types in the Old Testament show us that whenever anyone went before God, he had to offer the sin offering and the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, when you come to the Lord, you need to take Him as your sin offering and trespass offering, asking Him to cleanse you with His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Once you are cleansed, you will be enlivened in your spirit by the Spirit of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When your spirit is made alive, you must learn not to speak according to your thought and your mind but according to your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This does not mean that you do not use your mind any more.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the contrary, the more you use your spirit, the sharper your mind will be and the clearer and wiser your thoughts will become.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, begin with your spirit; that is, touch the Lord from the deepest part of your being.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Read and pray by means of His words.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Just read and pray, pray and read, without trying too hard to be different or original or loud.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When you are truly inspired, you may say, Amen, O Lord, how good it is!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How I praise You!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This kind of pray-reading will cause the word of God to be impressed into your whole being as your supply.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Paul said, All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness 2 Tim 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When we pray-read in this way and get the Lord s words into us, some of the words become a conviction to us, some become a teaching, some correct us, and some instruct us in righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As a result, we who are men of God are made complete, fully equipped for every good work.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is different from reading the books of Confucius and Mencius and accepting their teachings on ethics and morality.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Rather, we pray by means of the Word of God and the Spirit of God to take in God Himself, who is in His words and in His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In this way, His words in us not only become a supply to us, but they also convict and teach us from deep within.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is the proper way to read the Lord s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>May the Lord give us grace and strength and lead us to practice this every day.</S>
