   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GOD-MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that the ark was made of acacia wood overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The acacia wood and the gold typify the two natures of Christ: the gold typifies His divine nature, and the acacia wood, His human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Both within and without, the ark was overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that Christ is divine, that He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, He is not only God, but also a man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, Christ is a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The gold-wood ark typifies Christ as the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is a mark of blindness and foolishness to oppose the truth that Christ is a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Certain of our opposers seem to pay attention only to the gold of the ark, only to Christ s divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They do not pay adequate attention to the fact that the ark is made of wood overlaid with gold, to the fact that Christ is truly the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We most assuredly believe that Christ is God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But we realize that just as the ark was made of wood overlaid with gold, so Christ has a human nature within His divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In time to come, more believers will realize that, as the One typified by the ark made of wood overlaid with gold, Christ is the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The truth will go out, and it will convince, subdue, and enlighten.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We praise the Lord for this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As the God-man, the One who possesses both the divine nature and the human nature, Christ is both the Creator and a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Several years ago some who oppose this truth declared, Our Christ is the Creator He is not a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What blindness!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Bible says clearly that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation Col 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because Christ is all-inclusive, He is the first of the creatures and He is the Creator of all.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If Christ were only God and not man, only the Creator and not a creature, He would not be all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He would not be the reality of all positive things in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Eventually, either in this age or in the coming age, all those who oppose today will come to believe that Christ is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In eternity we all shall know that Christ is God and man, the Creator and the creature, for He is the ark made of acacia wood overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE TOPMOST PART OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The most crucial part of the ark of the testimony was its cover.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many buildings in ancient times had something called a topstone, or capstone.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The cover of the ark was like a capstone of a building.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The propitiatory cover of the ark signifies the topmost part of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Hebrew word for cover here means a lid.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Most translators, however, do not regard the word lid as an adequate rendering, for they realize that this cover is not simple in its significance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For example, there were two cherubim on the lid, the cover, of the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although no one can describe these cherubim, we know that they had faces, eyes, and wings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Exodus 25:20 says, And the cherubim shall spread out their wings above, covering over with their wings the propitiatory cover, with their faces each toward the other; toward the propitiatory cover the faces of the cherubim shall be.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The cherubim were made at the two ends of the propitiatory cover, and their wings covered the entire lid.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The cherubim were made of beaten work, signifying that Christ s expression of the divine glory was through sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to the Bible, these cherubim signify God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Wherever the cherubim are, there the glory of God is also.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, the picture of the propitiatory cover with the cherubim shows that God s glory, signified by the cherubim, is upon Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In verses such as these, it is necessary to have an accurate translation to obtain the proper understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, it is not easy to translate the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not think that simply because a person has a scholarly knowledge of biblical languages he is qualified to translate the Bible properly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To translate the Bible accurately we must know the truth of the Bible as a whole and we should also have experience in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to the truth of the Bible, blood was sprinkled on the propitiatory cover of the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This blood came from the sacrifices offered on the brass altar in the outer court for propitiation, sacrifices to make peace between sinners and God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The blood of these sacrifices was brought into the Holy of Holies and sprinkled seven times on the propitiatory cover.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>No doubt, at least a large area of the lid was covered by the sprinkled blood.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As a result, the golden lid was eventually covered with blood.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The ark in this way became a place of propitiation for man with God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In a foregoing message we pointed out that the ark of testimony has a rim of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The King James Version uses the word crown.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This may imply that the cover of the ark is a crown.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This signifies that, as the One typified by the ark, Christ wears a crown.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A crown is always placed on the top of a person s head and may be worn as a special hat, or cap.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In seeking to understand the significance of the ark of testimony for our spiritual experience, we should not rely on the ability of our natural mind.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To attempt to do this is to be like cows listening to beautiful music: the sounds can be heard, but there is no understanding or appreciation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There were times many years ago that I was like such a cow listening to messages.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although I could easily recite all the points of a certain message even a year afterward, I didn t understand the music or appreciate it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I did not have genuine spiritual vision, and I was short of light from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>By the Lord s mercy, my situation today is very different.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Now I appreciate the music I hear from the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I hope that more and more of the saints will also come to appreciate the music.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Concerning the ark, we need light from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In particular, we need light regarding the cover, the cherubim, the rim, and the sprinkling of the blood on the lid of the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Exodus 25:22 says, And I will meet with you there, and will speak with you from above the propitiatory cover, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, all that I shall command you concerning the sons of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This verse indicates that God could meet with man and speak with man between the cherubim on the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Would you have the boldness to come into the Holy of Holies, stand before the ark, and meet with God face to face?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Even though I have known the grace of God for many years, I would not have such boldness.</S>
