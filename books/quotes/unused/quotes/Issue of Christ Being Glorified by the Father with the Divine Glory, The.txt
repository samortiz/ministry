In His resurrection He was born with His humanity to be the firstborn Son of God for His divine transformation
Through His resurrection all His believers were regenerated to be the many sons of God for His divine multiplication
The matter of Christs being glorified by the Father is referred to in the following verses of John 739 854 1216 23 133132 171 5
John 1:1 reveals that Christ, the Word, is God: 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God'
Of the words His humanity it is perhaps better to use the expression His flesh, for John 1:14 tells us that the very God became flesh
When Christ was in the flesh, in His humanity, His flesh was a shell which concealed His divinity and thereby concealed His glory
When He was living on earth in the flesh, on the one hand He was God, who is glory, and on the other hand He was flesh
Because the divine glory was concealed within the shell of His flesh, it was necessary for Him to be glorified
As God Christ Himself was glory, but this glory was concealed in the shell of His humanity, and thus His divine glory could not be seen
Matthew 17:2 says, 'He was transfigured before them, and His face shined like the sun, and His garments became as white as the light'
Whereas only three beheld the glorified Jesus on the mountain before His resurrection, after His resurrection millions can see Him
Today we see not a Christ who is still in the shell but a Christ who has come out of the shell and has been glorified
Today this fire is burning all over the earth in America in Russia in Romania in Poland in Brazil in Africa in Australia in New Zealand
In the book of Revelation we see that Christ is the Lion-Lamb; He is the Lion to defeat Satan and He is the Lamb to redeem us
When the concealed glory of Christ's divinity was released, a divine fire was cast on earth to burn the whole earth
Lord, give us a heart to seek after You as the glorified One, and grant us the up-to-date utterance to release what You have shown us
The general subject of these messages is the issue of Christ being glorified by the Father with the divine glory
Rather, the Lord prayed that the Father would glorify the Son that the Father might be glorified in the Son's glorification
We all need to see that the glory of Christ's divinity, which was concealed in the shell of His flesh, has been released
If a grain of wheat does not fall into the ground and die, it abides by itself alone and no one knows what is within the grain
When He was living in His humanity for thirty-three and a half years, no one, including His mother, knew who He was
Others regarded Him as nothing more than a man, but no one knew what He was according to the contents of His inner being
In the sense explained above, Christ's death is considered the life-releasing death with His glory released simultaneously
In Luke 24:26 the Lord said of Himself, 'Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and enter into His glory'?
Acts 3:13 uses the expression the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, which indicates that God is the God of resurrection
A similar expression is used in Matthew 22, where the Sadducees were arguing with the Lord Jesus about resurrection
God is the God of resurrection, and these three forefathers will not remain dead but will be resurrected to be living'
According to the New Testament thought resurrection is a release in life, and this release in life is a matter of glorification
Just before He was about to be crucified the Lord Jesus prayed not that the Father would resurrect Him but that the Father would glorify Him
If we glorify a certain person in the sense of praising and exalting him, this kind of glorification does not transfer him
He was in the first stage, the stage of incarnation, but He was transferred out of that stage into the second stage, the stage of inclusion
Christ's being glorified was a drastic change not only in His condition and situation but also in His nature, element, and essence
Because he is now praised instead of despised, his condition and situation are changed, but his nature, element, and essence remain the same
Although 7:39 says that 'the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified,' glorification is not covered in this section
If we see this, we will realize that we cannot know chapter fourteen without understanding the glorification in chapter twelve
Rather, He retained His divinity, but, as Philippians 2 indicates, He concealed His divinity within His humanity
According to Romans 1 the gospel of God, the complete gospel preached in the New Testament, concerns the Son of God, Jesus Christ our Lord
In this way the only begotten Son of God was made the firstborn Son of God, possessing both divinity and humanity
In this sense, we may say that He was God becoming a man, and now we, who are the children of God, are men becoming gods
To avoid theological misunderstanding, it may be better to say that as children of God we are God-men in the divine species
Formerly, we had nothing to do with God, but regeneration has brought us into the union of life with the processed Triune God
The consummated Triune God and the regenerated believers became an incorporation in the resurrection of Christ
In this message we have been burdened to point out that Christ's glorification produced an issue an incorporation
God's intention is that all the believers of Christ would be incorporated into His incorporation to be an enlarged incorporation
You have regenerated us so that we would no longer be natural, but we remain in our natural life, and we are natural even in seeking You
Lord, have mercy upon us and be our High Priest, the One who is easily touched by the feeling of our infirmities
We have been raised up, taught, and trained under the influence of this theology, and we are still under its influence
Eventually, for eternity in the new heaven and new earth, there will be the New Jerusalem, the unique goal of God in His economy
Although we have seen that the New Jerusalem is the goal of God's economy, we did not see that the New Jerusalem is an incorporation
Now we need to learn something new and see that as the tabernacle of God the New Jerusalem is the universal incorporation
At this juncture we need to consider the Lord's word to the church in Pergamos , the third of the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3
As a sign, the church in Pergamos prefigures the church that entered into a marriage union with the world to be one with the world
The Son is in the Father, that the Father is in the Son, and that the Son as the Spirit is the reality of the Holy of Holies
The New Jerusalem is the tabernacle of God, and the center of this tabernacle is Christ as the hidden manna for us to eat
Are you a part of the world, or are you a part of the New Jerusalem as God's tabernacle, the universal incorporation?
We should not be joined to the world we should be incorporated into the New Jerusalem by eating Christ as the hidden manna
Let us now begin to consider the three aspects of the incorporation of the consummated God with the regenerated believers
The first aspect of the incorporation of the consummated God with the regenerated believers is the house of the Father
Chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen of John are a long message given by the Lord Jesus shortly before He was arrested
In John 14 we have the Father's house; in John 15, the Son's vine; and in John 16, the child born of the Spirit
The Father's house is also the kingdom of God, which is composed of the believers in Christ as the citizens , in two aspects
The first aspect of the Father's house as the kingdom of God is the kingdom of God as the church life in this age
The purpose of the Father's house is for the satisfaction and rest of the processed and consummated Triune God
Prayer Lord we thank You that we could come back to You to wait on You until You show us this universal view of Your universal incorporation
You have come to Your recovery to open up this matter, to show us something which the angels and the worldly people have never seen
Whatever He does in time is to incorporate all His chosen ones into His incorporation to make a great universal incorporation
We have seen that the way to be incorporated into this unique incorporation is to enjoy Christ, to eat Him, to partake of Him
In John 16:12-15 the Lord said that He had many things to tell the disciples which they could not bear at that time
In our ministry we have used three words to describe the believers' relationship with the Triune God: union, mingling, and incorporation
According to this definition, when two or more things are mingled together, their original natures are not lost but remain distinguishable
The Lord has gone further to show us that our relationship with Him is not only one of union and mingling but also one of incorporation
Verse17 says that the Spirit of reality, another Comforter, would not only be with the disciples but also in them
Humanly speaking, we can have our physical father's life and nature, but our father as a person cannot be in us
In the divine and mystical realm, the consummated God and the regenerated believers, the persons, indwell one another
The unique God is eventually enlarged into one city for His eternal enlargement and eternal expression as a great universal incorporation
In chapter twelve of John this Wonderful One was exalted by His disciples, but He did not accept their kind of exaltation
These three ins reveal that the consummated Triune God and the regenerated believers became an incorporation in the resurrection of Christ
In John 14 the Lord revealed that He came as the first Comforter and that another One would come as the second Comforter
When the Spirit of reality is in us, the totality of the Triune God is in us to incorporate us into the universal incorporation
In John 16:12-15 the Lord told the disciples, 'I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now
The Spirit of reality declares all the things concerning Christ in the last twenty-two books of the New Testament, the Epistles
Mainly three apostles Paul, Peter, and John present this revelation to us in their Epistles piece by piece and bit by bit
By the Lord's mercy, we have put these pieces together to see a full and complete vision of this universal incorporation
Christ is the house, the temple, the dwelling place of God; Christ is the vine tree; and Christ is the new man
The true vine is a sign of the all-inclusive Christ as the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God
The first group of Christ's believers who suffered Christ's departure through His death was the delivering woman
The kingdom of God as the church life in this age is for the believers' exercise and equipping in the divine authority
The kingdom of Christ in the kingdom age is for the overcoming saints to reign with Christ over all the nations
