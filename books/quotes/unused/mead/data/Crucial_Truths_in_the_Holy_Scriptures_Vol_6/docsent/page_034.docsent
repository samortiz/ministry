   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I am fleshy, sold under sin Rom 7:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Bible speaks of both sin and sins, with sin referring to indwelling sin and sins referring to outward manifestations of sinful acts.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Since indwelling sin relates to man s sinful nature, it is often referred to in the Bible in the singular as sin.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Since outward sins relate to man s sinful actions, it is often referred to in the Bible in the plural as sins.</S>

   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Man s inward nature is full of sin, and it is active within man.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This indwelling sin is actually the personification of the devil within us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As such, sin dwells in us and forces us to do evil and to commit sins.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Sin revived Rom 7:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Our sinful nature cannot be separated from our living.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Although the operation of sin may seem to be dormant at times, it can always be revived.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This shows that sin is part of our living.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, worked out in me coveting of every kind ; For sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me ; Become death to me Rom 7:8, 11, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Since sin is personified in us, it seizes every opportunity to cause us to commit sins.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>For example, it works out coveting of every kind in us by means of God s commandment, and it can deceive us, kill us, and even become death to us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This proves that indwelling sin is strong and living.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Sin reigned in death Rom 5:21; see also 6:12 .</S>

   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Lord it over you Rom 6:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Since indwelling sin reigns and exercises authority over us, it also lords over and controls us, making us its slaves.</S>

   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Every living thing lives according to a law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Since our indwelling sin is living, it also operates according to the law of its life.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The Bible calls this law the law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The law of sin is out of sin, belongs to sin, and causes people to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This law is in the corrupted members of our flesh, and it fights against the law of good in our mind and eventually captures us v. 23 , causing us to do evil and to die vv.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>21, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Since this law causes us to sin and to die, it is also called the law of sin and of death 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>A law is a natural power that operates spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>For example, gravity is a law that acts to draw things toward the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Similarly, indwelling sin has a natural power that causes us to sin spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Because the law of sin operates within us automatically, we do not have to exert any conscious effort to commit sins.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Since sin is living in us, it indwells us, reigns over us, lords over us, controls us, enslaves us, makes us do sinful things against our will, and causes us to die.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>It is a spontaneous law with a natural power that causes us to sin and die.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Most people do not pay attention to this aspect of indwelling sin, and it is also difficult for people to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>People think of sin primarily in relation to outward actions.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Consequently, they do not believe that a person is sinful if he does not commit definite sinful acts.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>They do not have a clear realization of man s has a sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Consequently, they do not realize that a person who does not commit gross sinful acts is still full of sin and therefore a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>If a peach tree does not produce peaches, it is still a peach tree because it has the nature of a peach tree.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>It is a peach tree because it has the peach tree nature; it does not need to produce peaches in order to be a peach tree.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Similarly, man is sinful and a sinner because he has a sinful nature; he is not a sinner only because he has committed some sinful acts.</S>
