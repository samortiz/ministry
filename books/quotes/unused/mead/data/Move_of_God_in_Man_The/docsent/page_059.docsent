   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Bible tells us that Christ is not only in ascension but also in us Col 1:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If He were working only in ascension, His work would have nothing to do with us, and His work could never be our story as a part of God's history in us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But today He is working within us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because His work is within us, this work is related to our history.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>So this work is God's history in His union with man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is working in His ascension within us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As the ascended One with many statuses and positions, He is moving within us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to see this.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Merely to learn this is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I have been living in Anaheim for nineteen years, and I see Anaheim every day.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If I were asked to tell you about Anaheim without ever having been here, I would have to learn a lot by exercising my mind.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But now that I have seen Anaheim so much, I do not need to merely exercise my mind to speak about it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I can simply tell you what I have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I hope that we see something as a vision through these messages on the ascension of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the whole universe, there is such a scene into which Christ entered.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He came down from the heavens in incarnation, and then He entered into His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His being in ascension, in the heavenlies, is a great part of His dynamic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and then He reached resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As the resurrection, He entered into His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These steps were His move in man to carry out His dynamic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today God is still moving in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is living, dwelling, staying, ministering, serving, working, moving, and acting in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is in His ascension within us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is why Paul tells us that we are seated together with Christ in His ascension, which Paul calls "the heavenlies."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The very heavenlies referred to by Paul is the ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Within our being there is something quite extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This extraordinary thing is a person, the ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He came into us in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord today is in our spirit in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this ascension the Triune God moves in us, and this move becomes His history.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It also becomes our history because we and He, He and we, are now mingled as one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We two have the same history.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Before a man and woman are married they have two histories, but once they are married they become a couple in a marriage life with one history.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today we and our God, the Triune God, are one, so He and we have one history.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Otherwise, how could the Bible say that we live Christ Phil 1:21a , that we are the fullness of Christ Eph 1:23 , and that we are the members, parts, of the counterpart of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Eph 5:25, 30 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Your ears are members of your physical body, but actually your ears are you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this sense, as the members of Christ's Body, we are Christ, and this Christ is in ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God, and we are parts of this embodiment in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whenever we are gathered together into His name, Christ is there with all His members in ascension, and this is God's move within man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is a part of His history.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whether we can present this message to our fellow-believers depends upon whether we have seen something.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our seeing changes us inwardly, and this is transformation.</S>
