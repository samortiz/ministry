   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE SEVEN PARTAKING OF CHRIST IN THE LIGHT Scripture Reading: Col 1:12-13; Gen 1:3; Psa 36:9; 119:105; Isa 2:5; Matt 4:16; John 1:4; Acts 26:18; 1 John 1:5; Rev 21:23</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1:12 Paul says that the Father has qualified us for a share of the portion of the saints in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many may read this verse without paying attention to the phrase in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ, our portion, is to be enjoyed by us in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we need to consider what it is to partake of Christ, the portion of the saints, in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Bible reveals that when God restored the universe He had judged because of the rebellion of Satan, the first thing He did was to cause light to appear.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Darkness had been on the surface of the deep.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then God said, Let there be light, and light came forth Gen 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This took place on the first day.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the fourth day we see a more solid form of light: the sun, the moon, and the stars.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The light on the first day was rather abstract and unsubstantial, but on the fourth day we have the solid luminaries.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By this we see that the re-creation of the universe, or its restoration, was carried out by light.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>References to light abound in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Psalm 36:9 says, In thy light shall we see light.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Psalm 119:105 the psalmist declares, Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, Isaiah 2:5 says, O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although the Bible has much to say about light, it is difficult to give an adequate definition of light.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Light is real and substantial, yet it is mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nevertheless, the Bible indicates that light was a basic factor in the restoration of the universe and that light is necessary for God s people to walk in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Matthew 4:16 says that when Jesus was walking through Galilee, the people sitting in darkness saw a great light, and to those sitting in the region and shadow of death, to them light sprang up.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In John 8:12 the Lord Jesus said that He is the light of the world and that whoever follows Him will not walk in darkness, but have the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, if we do not follow Him as the light, we shall be in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, at the time of Paul s conversion, the Lord Jesus told him to open the eyes of people so that they may turn from darkness to light Acts 26:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This indicates that unbelievers, whether Jews or Gentiles, are in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Anyone who does not believe in the Lord Jesus is in darkness and needs to turn from darkness to light.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, 1 John 1:5 says that God is light and that in Him there is no darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in darkness, we lie.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since God is light, if we have fellowship with Him, we also shall be in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I. THE LIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Bible reveals that the light is related to God, the Word of God, Christ, the life of Christ, the believers, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A. God</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have pointed out that 1 John 1:5 says that God is light.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He alone is the source of light.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Word of God, Christ, the life of Christ, the believers, and the church can all be light because they have God as their source.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>B. The Word of God</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Psalm 119:105 says that the Word of God is a lamp to our feet and a light to our path, and 119:130 says that the entrance of God s words gives light.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Word of God is light because it contains God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If the Bible did not contain God, the words of the Bible could not enlighten us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The source of the Bible is God, and God is light.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, the words of the Bible are the shining of light.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>C. Christ</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In John 9:5 the Lord Jesus said, While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God and Christ are one.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since God is light, Christ also is light.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ is the light of the world in a very definite way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The world in John 9:5 denotes society, mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, Christ is the light not just in a general way, but in a definite way as the light of society, of mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>D. The Life of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The life of Christ is also light.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>John 1:4 says, In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we receive Christ as life, this life becomes light in us, shining upon us and enlightening us from within.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>E. The Believers</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Those who believe in Christ are also the light.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Speaking of the believers, the Lord Jesus said, You are the light of the world Matt 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In Philippians 2:15 Paul says that the believers shine as lights in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Greek for lights is better rendered luminaries.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A luminary does not have light in itself; it reflects light that comes from another source.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The believers are luminaries.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In ourselves we have no light.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The light comes from the oil, the Spirit, burning within us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The source of our light is not ourselves, but Christ as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>F. The Church</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In Revelation 1:20 we see that the church is a lampstand, a stand that holds and supports a burning lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The lamp is Christ with God in Him as light Rev 21:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the universe there is one light, God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Triune God is the unique light.</S>
