 <h2 class="head2">C. Choosing God and His Kingdom</h2>
<p>Both Ruth&rsquo;s husband and his brother died without leaving any descendants, and her husband had no other brother who could marry her to bear children for her husband. Nevertheless, she followed her widowed mother-in-law to the land of Judah to be a citizen of Israel and to receive the God of Israel as her God.</p>
<p>When her mother-in-law urged her to return to her people and to her gods, Ruth said, &ldquo;Do not entreat me to leave you and turn away from following after you. For wherever you go, I will go, and wherever you dwell, I will dwell; and your people will be my people, and your God will be my God&rdquo; (v. 16). Ruth chose the goal of God and His kingdom in order to participate with God&rsquo;s elect in the enjoyment of Christ. Eventually, she became an important ancestor of Christ, one who helped bring forth Christ into mankind (Matt. 1:5).</p>
<p>Regardless of who we are and what our background is, we are in a position to be accepted into the birthright of Christ as long as we have a heart that seeks God and His people.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Exercising Her Right<br />
to Glean the Harvest of God&rsquo;s Elect</h2>
<p>Ruth returned to Bethlehem with her mother-in-law at the beginning of the barley harvest (Ruth 1:22b). However, they returned empty, having nothing, and thus became needy ones among God&rsquo;s elect. According to God&rsquo;s loving care, when the children of Israel reaped the harvest of their land, they were not to completely reap the corners of their field, neither were they to gather the gleanings of their harvest; they were to leave them for the poor and the sojourner (Lev. 23:22; 19:9-10). If they forgot a sheaf in the field, they were not to turn back to gather it; it was for the sojourner, the orphan, and the widow (Deut. 24:19). Ruth came to the good land, and according to her threefold status as a sojourner, a poor one, and a widow, she exercised her right to glean the harvest. Her gleaning was not a begging; it was an exercising of her right. Ruth, a Moabitess, a heathen sinner, alienated from God&rsquo;s promises (Eph. 2:12), was privileged to partake of the crumbs under the table of the portion of God&rsquo;s elect children (Matt. 15:25-28).</p>
<p>This portrays that sinners have the way, the position, the qualification, and the right to participate in Christ and to enjoy Christ. According to God&rsquo;s ordination, we have been qualified and positioned to exercise our right to enjoy Christ. We do not need to beg God to save us. We can go to God to claim His salvation for ourselves. This is the highest standard of receiving the gospel. We have the position, qualification, and right to claim salvation from God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Gaining a Redeeming Husband</h2>
<p>Ruth not only had the right to partake of the rich produce of the inheritance of God&rsquo;s elect, but under the prodding of her mother-in-law, she also sought a resting place (Ruth 3:1). According to God&rsquo;s ordination in Leviticus 25:25, &ldquo;If your brother becomes poor and sells some of his possession, then his redeemer, the nearest relative, shall come and redeem what his brother has sold.&rdquo; Moreover, according to Deuteronomy 25:5-9, if brothers dwelled together and one died and had no son, the wife of the deceased man should not become the wife of a stranger outside the family, but her husband&rsquo;s brother should take her as his wife to bear a child for his deceased brother. Therefore, according to her mother-in-law&rsquo;s charge and based upon the God-ordained way (Ruth 3:6), Ruth approached Boaz, who was a kinsman of her deceased husband. She was accepted by Boaz and received his promise and generous care (vv. 10-15). Eventually, she was married to Boaz and was redeemed by him to be his wife (4:9-10). Her actions were witnessed and blessed by the people and the elders in the gate. She was also blessed by God to conceive and bring forth a son. Thus, she became a crucial ancestor in the genealogy of Christ to bring in the royal house of David to continue the line of God-created humanity for the incarnation of Christ to accomplish the eternal economy of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Typifying the Church of the Gentiles</h2>
<p>Ruth typifies the church of the Gentiles, composed of Gentile sinners who were alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and without God in the world, yet who are now fellow citizens with the saints, having God as their God (Eph. 2:11-13, 16, 19).</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Before Her Salvation, as Men<br />
in God&rsquo;s Creation and Sinners in Man&rsquo;s Fall</h2>
<p>Being a woman in Adam in God&rsquo;s creation and a Moabitess in man&rsquo;s fall, Ruth typifies the church in her status as the old man before salvation in two aspects&mdash;as men in God&rsquo;s creation and as sinners in man&rsquo;s fall (Rom. 6:6). Ruth had an incestuous background, and we all have the same background. Adam and Eve joined themselves to Satan; that is, they married Satan. This was the initiation of incest. Hence, the Moabites typify all sinners, because all sinners are born of incest.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. With Her Old Man as Her Crucified Husband Redeemed by Christ for the Recovery<br />
of the Lost Right of Her Natural Man<br />
in God&rsquo;s Creation</h2>
<p>Ruth, as the widow of the dead husband, was redeemed by Boaz, who cleared the indebtedness of her dead husband to recover the lost right to her dead husband&rsquo;s property. In this aspect Ruth typifies the church, whose old man is her crucified husband (7:4a), being redeemed by Christ, who cleared away the sin of the old man for the recovery of the lost right of her natural man in God&rsquo;s creation.</p>
<p>The believers&rsquo; old man is composed of the natural part created by God and the fallen part corrupted by sin. This old man has been crucified with Christ. The crucifixion of Christ has redeemed the natural part and destroyed the fallen part, clearing away the sin of the fallen part. Christ did not redeem the fallen part of our old man; He terminated it. He redeemed the God-created part in order to recover us.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. After Being Saved through the Regeneration<br />
of Her Natural Man,<br />
Becoming the Counterpart of Christ</h2>
<p>Ruth&rsquo;s becoming a new wife to Boaz after being redeemed by him typifies the church&rsquo;s becoming the counterpart of Christ after being saved through the regeneration of her natural man (v. 4b). Our natural man was created by God to be God&rsquo;s counterpart, taking God as our Husband and Head, but in the fall our natural man put God aside and made himself the husband and head, thus becoming the main part of our old man. After being redeemed and regenerated, our natural man, not including our fallen part, becomes our new man and takes Christ as our new Husband in a divine organic union with Him (v. 4b). Ruth typifies the church being saved through the regeneration of her natural man. This makes the church a new creation to be a new maiden, a new wife. Hence, the church becomes the counterpart of Christ in an organic union with Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Gentile Sinners Being Attached to Christ That They May Partake<br />
of the Inheritance of God&rsquo;s Promise</h2>
<p>Ruth&rsquo;s being united to Boaz typifies the Gentile sinners&rsquo; being attached to Christ so that they may partake of the inheritance of God&rsquo;s promise (Eph. 3:6). Once we are joined to Christ, we enjoy God&rsquo;s promise. Hence, we are God-created persons, fallen persons, redeemed persons, and regenerated persons. We have become a new creation in our organic union with Christ through regeneration. God has allotted us the all-inclusive Christ, typified by the good land, to be our eternal portion and has transferred us into Him to participate in Him (Col. 1:12; 1 Cor. 1:30, 9). Hence, we can produce a home for rest in Him, and we can bring forth Christ and spread Christ.</p>
