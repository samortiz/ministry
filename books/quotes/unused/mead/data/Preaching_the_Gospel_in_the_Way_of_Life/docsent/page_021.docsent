   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Crucified and Resurrected</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One day He went to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He was crucified and He died there.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, because He is the very God, the source of life, after He died, He resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It may seem rather difficult to believe in the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Bible, however, we have a very good illustration, that of a grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When someone sows a seed, he buries the seed in the soil, and the seed dies.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It truly dies, but after death something grows up.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 1936 I went to the old capital of China, Beijing, and I was invited to the home of a professor at one of the biggest universities in China, to help some young students to believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After my preaching, an intelligent young student came to me and said, "Mr. Lee, there is one thing that I cannot get through.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you can help me to get through it, then I will believe what you are preaching here.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I cannot believe that a person can die and then be resurrected."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On that campus there were some fields of wheat growing in the wintertime in North China.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I pointed through the window and said, "Look at those grains of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do you see resurrection there?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Just two months ago people sowed the seeds into the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The seeds died there, but after death something grew up.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The seeds resurrected because within the seeds there is a powerful, dynamic life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You can bury a seed, but you cannot bury the life in it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you bury a piece of rock, it is really buried, and that is the end. Nothing will grow up because there is no life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you bury a seed, however, after a certain amount of time it grows up.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ is the very God who is the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To put Him into death was not to put Him to an end; that simply helped Him to grow up.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Within Him there is life, and this life is a very dynamic power to grow in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ died on the cross, and then He resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"A seed has a certain kind of form, but after it dies and grows up, the form changes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After His resurrection, Christ changed in form; He was transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is something too wonderful and too mysterious, beyond our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Can you explain how a small round seed after death and resurrection becomes tall and green?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Only God understands the law, the principle, which governs a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One little round seed grows up to be a tree, another grows up to be a flower, and another grows up to be wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Moreover, all wheat is of the same form.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There must be a law governing that, which only God knows."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Through this illustration, that young man in the university was saved that day.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After he believed, he started to love the Lord, and he was very much used by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today he is a leading one in the church in his locality.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I wish to impress you that Christ is the most wonderful One in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is God, and He is the very Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One day He became a man; then He died on the cross, He resurrected, and He has been transformed into a wonderful form.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today He is firstly called the Savior and then the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Moreover, He is also the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If I had the time, I would refer you to all the verses that tell us these things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When Christ was crucified on the cross, He was the Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now today, after His resurrection, He is the Spirit as the living Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is the mighty Savior, the Lord, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is the Spirit; this means that He is just like the air, so available to us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Wherever we are, there He is, and wherever we go, there He goes, just like the air.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We cannot separate ourselves from the air.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today we have the word pneumatic.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is what the Spirit is.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ is the very Spirit today.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I repeat: He is God, the Creator; one day He became a man, and he died on the cross as the Redeemer to redeem us; then He resurrected and was transformed into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Now today He is the Spirit as the living Savior, and He is our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As the Spirit, He is everywhere; He is so available.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we receive Him, we receive Him as an all-inclusive One.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In Him is God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In Him is the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In Him is man, the Redeemer, and the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In Him we have the Lord, and He is the very Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the first item we have to know.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I am presenting these items to you in a very brief and simple way.</S>
