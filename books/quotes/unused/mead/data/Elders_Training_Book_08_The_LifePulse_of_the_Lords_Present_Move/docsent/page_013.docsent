   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PROPHESYING SPEAKING FOR GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND SPEAKING FORTH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Corinthians 14:32 indicates that we need to exercise our spirit to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To prophesy is not mainly to predict or to foretell the future.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is something miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The word prophesy mainly means to speak for God and to speak forth God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When God called Moses to go to Pharaoh, Moses told Him that he was not eloquent Exo 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord gave Moses his brother Aaron to be his prophet, his spokesman Exo 4:16; 7:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As Moses prophet, Aaron spoke for Moses and even spoke forth Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To prophesy is to speak for another and to speak forth another.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When most Christians hear the word prophesy they always think of it in the sense of predicting or foretelling the future.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The main meaning, however, of the word prophesy is to speak for God and to speak forth God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need the spirit to speak for God and to speak forth God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Otherwise, whatever we say will just be an ordinary speaking, not prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I may be a bona fide Christian and an ethical, nice gentleman.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If I speak in a church meeting in a meek, mild, and normal way this is not prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Apparently I am speaking for God and speaking forth God, telling something of God to others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But actually I am a gentleman, a mild man, a meek man, speaking with no spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to exercise our spirit when we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In our regenerated spirit dwells the Spirit Rom 8:16 , so whenever we exercise our spirit the indwelling Spirit moves.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we do not use our spirit, and merely speak or converse in an ordinary way, that is not to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To prophesy is to speak for God, to speak forth God, from your spirit in which, through which, and with which the Holy Spirit speaks in you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the difference between prophesying and the human, ordinary speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many times in our church meetings, too many of the sharings are just ordinary, human speech.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Regardless of how nice this kind of speaking is, it does not edify, it does not build up.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sometimes even the one who gives the message speaks in the way that a typical gentleman converses, with no exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This kind of speaking kills the audience; it does not give life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Regardless of whether you have a big meeting or a small group meeting, the principle is the same to speak without the exercise of the spirit kills the ones to whom you are speaking 2 Cor 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many of today s Christian meetings will slaughter or kill your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To some extent we are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The elders need to have meetings in their localities continuously for two weeks to train the saints in these things before starting any practice.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Otherwise, you will be trying to practice the Lord s present and new move with dead bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I can illustrate what the elders are doing by relating something that happened in my home town of Chefoo in 1943.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There was a strong sister in the church there who spoke in tongues, and the entire church was captured by her.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One sister died whom we all loved.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then the sister who spoke in tongues prophesied and told the husband of the dead sister not to prepare any funeral.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>She said that the next day at twelve noon, our sister would be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>That stirred up the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The next day before noon, the house was crowded with the saints to see this resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A short time before noon, the tongue-speaking sister came in with two helpers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They all kneeled down and spoke in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After approximately one hour, nothing happened, so she lay down on the dead sister s body, mouth to mouth and arm to arm, and she attempted to breathe life into the dead sister.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Nothing happened.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then she and her two helpers picked this dead body up and tried to get the body to walk on the floor.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Eventually, one of the leading ones charged the husband to prepare a funeral for our sister.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Sometimes the elders try to do the same thing with the saints in their locality.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the attendants are dead bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You try to breathe life into them and nothing happens.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then you try to pick them up and even hold them up, hoping that they will be brought to life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Eventually, everyone gets disappointed with the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Most of the saints like to have a big gathering with a good speaker speaking to them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They feel inspired and edified in this kind of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But mostly they do not appreciate coming together in the way of mutuality with everyone speaking, whether it be in a home gathering or with the whole church coming together.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the situation because all the attendants are like dead bodies, somewhat like the scattered bones in Ezekiel 37.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Ezekiel 37 is a picture of today s Christianity, a picture of scattered bones.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the church meetings what we can see is mostly dead bodies, which is a little bit better than scattered bones.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The elders need to call a conference for two weeks and declare a fast.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The whole church needs to fast and pray for our poor, present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Let all the saints know and realize the poor situation among us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have no ground to criticize other Christian bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What about ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We are dead, cold, and lukewarm.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We need to fast and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then some proper messages need to be given to the saints to edify them, to enliven them, and to tell them that they need to shake the chairs.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I am not promoting tongue-speaking, but we need to fellowship with the saints to stir up their spirit in the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Chair shaking or tongue-speaking is not the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>That would get the saints addicted.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We need to stir up the saints in seeking such a spirit that is exercised to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Quite often in our meetings the one who is speaking will have to be told by some other saints to speak louder.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The reason why this person is speaking in such a way is because his spirit is not exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When we exercise our spirit there is a big difference in the way that we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The person giving a testimony must be told to speak louder because he is a carcass.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>A carcass is something dead with no spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>For the meeting of the entire church and for the home gatherings we all have to exercise our spirit, so we need to exercise our spirit in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Especially a half hour before meeting time we should exercise our spirit to get ourselves prepared for the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The members of an athletic team get themselves prepared for the game by warming up.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It would be a joke to think that they would come to play a game with a tie and a suit on.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But most of the saints come to the church meeting in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>One brother might ask another who is going to speak in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When he hears that there will be no speaker but that everybody will speak, he feels that this is too bad.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When he hears that Brother Lee is coming to speak, he gets excited and stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This shows how terrible the situation is among us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We say that we are in the recovery, but meeting-wise we still remain in Christianity, we still practice Christianity, and we still repeat Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The first thing needed is for the leading ones to call a conference and declare a fast.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Tell the saints for what purpose we have to fast for the deadness, the coldness, the lukewarmness, the indifference, and the spiritless situation.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We need to fast and we need to stir ourselves up.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We hate to repeat the history of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We do not promote chair shaking or tongue-speaking, but we like to see what is taught and revealed in 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We like to have the proper prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Again I want to say that prophesying is speaking for God with our spirit and speaking forth God with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>First Corinthians 14:1 tells us that we need to have an earnest desire to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Then verse 3 says that prophesying builds up, encourages, and consoles people.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Since to prophesy, to speak forth the Lord, ministers Christ to people, it builds up people and gives them encouragement and consolation.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Only prophesying can fulfill this three-fold duty to build up, to encourage, and to console the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This is what we need, so we have to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>First Corinthians 14:31 says, you can all prophesy...</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>God desires that each of the believers prophesy, that is, speak for and speak forth Him.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>In Numbers 11:29 Moses exclaimed to his helper Joshua, Would God that all the Lord s people were prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Even in Old Testament times, God wanted every one of His people to speak for Him and to speak forth Him.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>How much more should this matter of prophesying be with all the believers in the New Testament age!</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>I am concerned that even though I have given a message concerning this see The Divine Speaking pp.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>14-18 , and you may have heard this, you have not promoted it.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Everywhere the elders have to promote the prophesying of all the saints, including the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>According to 1 Corinthians 11:5 women can prophesy, and the book of Acts gives us illustrations of sisters being prophets 2:17-18; 21:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The Bible, however, does not allow sisters to teach with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Sisters should be silent in the meetings in the sense of teaching with authority 1 Cor 14:34; 1 Tim 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Both the sisters and the brothers are all privileged to speak for God and to speak forth God see note 34 2 in 1 Cor 14 Recovery Version .</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>For years I could not understand why in 1 Corinthians 11 a woman was allowed to pray and prophesy with her head covered, but in 1 Corinthians 14 Paul said that in the church meeting the women should be silent.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Eventually I realized from the Scriptures that sisters are privileged to prophesy even in big public meetings, but in any meeting sisters are not permitted to speak as a teacher to define certain doctrines with authority as the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The Lord never gave this portion to the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>All the sisters, however, are privileged to speak for God, to speak forth God.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>When they speak, they need some covering.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>This covering is not merely a piece of cloth, but it means that the sisters have to speak under the covering of the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>We all must see that whenever we come together either in a big gathering or in a small group the principle is the same we have to exercise our spirit that we may speak for God and that we may speak forth God.</S>
