<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 7:1-32, 37-52</h1><h2 class=head1>CHRIST FOR NOURISHMENT AND SATISFACTION</h2><p>The Gospel of John has much to say concerning the Jewish feasts. In chapters two, six, and twelve, we have the Passover; in chapter five, the feast of Purim; and in chapter seven, the feast of tabernacles. We have pointed out that the feast of Passover, the first of the Jewish annual feasts, implies the beginning of man’s life and that the feast of tabernacles, the last feast of the year, implies the completion of life. In the scene in chapter six there is the feast of Passover. In this chapter the Lord presents Himself as the bread of life to satisfy man’s hunger. In the scene in chapter seven there is the feast of tabernacles. Here the Lord says, “If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink” (v. 37). Furthermore, the Lord promised that the one who believes in Him will experience rivers of living water flowing out of his innermost being (v. 38). Here we have the living water to quench man’s thirst.<p>The feast of Passover is related to man’s hunger, and the feast of tabernacles, to man’s thirst. At the beginning of life we are hungry, but at the end of life we are thirsty. Therefore, we need the Lord Jesus as the living bread to feed us and as the living water to satisfy us. The feast of Passover signifies nourishment, and the feast of tabernacles signifies satisfaction. However, both the eating at the Passover in John 6 and the satisfaction at the feast of tabernacles in John 7 are shadows. Christ is the reality of both the feast of Passover and the feast of tabernacles. Therefore, we need Christ for our nourishment and satisfaction. Because He is the living bread within us and also the fountain of living water, He can feed us and satisfy us.<p>The feast of tabernacles, held at the end of the year with the ingatherings of the harvest, was for the people’s full enjoyment and satisfaction. However, those who attended this feast were not satisfied. This was the reason that “on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink” (7:37). The Lord cried out in this way because He realized that none of those attending the feast were satisfied. Year after year, they came to the feast of tabernacles, but they were not satisfied. Hence, the Lord called the thirsty ones to come to Him and drink. The “last day” in verse 37 signifies that all the enjoyment of any success of human life will end. There is a last day to every kind of material thing in human life. But in eternity the feast of tabernacle in the New Jerusalem will never end. That is the only feast that will last forever.<h2 class=head1>A LIFE RESTRICTED FOR GOD’S PURPOSE</h2><p>It is actually quite difficult for us to grasp the thought in chapter seven of John. It is easier to understand chapters three, four, five, and six than it is to understand this chapter. In John 1 we see that the Lord Jesus is the Lamb with the Dove. Concerning Him, John the Baptist said, “Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!” (v. 29). John also testified, “I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He abode upon Him” (v. 32). The fact that Jesus is the Lamb with the Dove indicates that He is the One who redeems us and puts us into the Spirit. In chapter two the Lord Jesus changed water into wine. That was the first of signs (2:11) and signifies life’s principle—changing death into life. In 2:12-22 we see life’s purpose—to build the house of God. Therefore, in John 2 we have the changing of death into life for the building up of God’s dwelling place. In 3:14 and 15 the Lord said to Nicodemus, “And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; that every one who believes in Him may have eternal life.” In this chapter Christ is the brass serpent, having the form of a serpent but not its poisonous nature, lifted up to die for us so that we may be regenerated with the divine life in order to become part of His increase. In chapter four Christ is the fountain of living water and also the reality of all the offerings. In chapter five Christ is the One to whom judgment has been given and the One who gives life. Then in chapter six Christ is the bread of life, the true, living bread out of heaven, to feed hungry people.<p>In chapters three through six we are clearly told what Christ is doing or what He is about to do. The situation is very different in chapter seven. In this chapter we do not have the record of any kind of doing or activity. What we see here is a certain kind of life. Chapter seven reveals a life that is restricted for God’s purpose. In this chapter we see that the Lord lived in such a way that He was restricted from doing anything for Himself. For example, the Lord’s brothers, who did not believe in Him, said to Him, “Depart from here and go into Judea, that your disciples also may see your works which you are doing; for no one does anything in secret and seeks himself to be known in public. If you do these things, show yourself to the world” (7:3-4). The Lord’s brothers seemed to be saying, “Since you are able to do miracles, why not show yourself openly and get a name for yourself? Don’t do things in secret. Go to Jerusalem and do something in public. That will cause you to become a great leader.” The brothers of the Lord followed man’s way, the way of self-glorification. But the Lord Jesus followed God’s way and said to them, “My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready” (v. 6). Although the Lord is the eternal, infinite, unlimited God, He lived here as a man, limited even in the matter of time.<p>In 7:7 and 8 the Lord went on to say to His brothers, “The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me, because I testify of it, that its works are evil. You go up to the feast; I am not going up to this feast, because My time has not yet fully come.” The Lord Jesus seemed to be telling His brothers, “I cannot do things in the way of glorifying man. You may act that way, for you are worldly people living for yourselves. But because I am not a worldly person and I am not living for Myself, I cannot follow that way. Also, I need to be careful because the Jews are seeking to kill Me. But My time, the time of My death, has not yet come.” The Lord knew that what was written in the Scriptures would be fulfilled at the feast of Passover, not at the feast of tabernacles. Hence, it was necessary for Him to be careful until the time had come for Him to be crucified. He knew that He would be put to death on the Passover and then resurrected on the feast of firstfruit. After that, He would become the reality of the feast of Pentecost for His disciples.<p>As the Lamb of God, the Lord Jesus was crucified on the Passover. Then on the third day, the day of the firstfruit, He was resurrected. Following that, He remained with His disciples for forty days, after which He ascended to the heavens. Then the disciples prayed for ten days. This means that after a total of fifty days, there was the feast of Pentecost, and the Lord became the full harvest. The point here is that the Lord Jesus lived a life restricted for God. Living such a restricted life, He knew that He was not to die at the feast of tabernacles, but at the feast of Passover. For this reason, in chapter seven He was very careful about going up to Jerusalem for the feast.
