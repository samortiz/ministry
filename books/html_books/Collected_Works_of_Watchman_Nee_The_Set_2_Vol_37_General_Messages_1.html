Some are words of exhortation and comfort; others are short expositions. Most of these messages were included in a Chinese series entitled Twelve Baskets Full, which consists of twelve books of miscellaneous messages. Four of these books have been previously published by the Living Stream Ministry under the title Twelve Baskets Full, Volumes 1&mdash;4. Since these messages were not originally published as a series under the title Twelve Baskets Full (they were later compiled from various sources by the Taiwan Gospel Bookroom), we have chosen to include them in the Collected Works under the title General Messages (1) and General Messages (2).</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1><h1 class="title">TWO KINDS OF<br />KNOWLEDGE OF THE LORD&mdash;<br />THAT WHICH IS ACCORDING TO THE FLESH<br />AND THAT WHICH IS ACCORDING<br />TO THE SPIRIT</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 20:11-18; Luke 24:13-16, 25-32; John 21:1-14</h1><p>From the Lord Jesus' resurrection until now, there are two kinds of knowledge of Him. One kind of knowledge is according to the flesh, and the other kind of knowledge is according to the Spirit. In 2 Corinthians 5:16, Paul said, "So then we, from now on, know no one according to the flesh; even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him so no longer." In Galatians 1:15-16, he also said, "It pleased God...to reveal His Son in me." These verses show us the proper means by which we can know the Lord Jesus today. Let us see these two kinds of knowledge of the Lord Jesus by considering a few concrete examples from the Bible.</p><h2 class="head1">MARY THE MAGDALENE'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE LORD</h2><p>While Mary the Magdalene was weeping outside the Lord's grave, "two angels in white...said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? She said to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid Him. When she said these things, she turned backward and beheld Jesus standing there, yet she did not know that it was Jesus" (John 20:12-14). It is strange that when she turned and saw Jesus, the One whom she had seen and followed for years, she could not recognize Him. The reason that she did not know the Lord at all, even though she knew Him so well before, was because the Son of God who had been in the flesh had been crucified on the cross and resurrected. The body which she desired to see was gone. All those who knew Him according to the flesh did not know Him any longer after His resurrection. He was no longer the Lord Jesus that she knew. He had become the Lord Jesus that she did not know. He was no longer a historical Jesus; He was living in the Spirit. He was no longer the Lord Jesus in the flesh but the Lord Jesus in the Spirit. She could no longer know Him by the same means that she did when she knew Him in the flesh.</p><p>"Jesus said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking? She, supposing that He was the gardener, said to Him, Sir, if you have carried Him away" (v. 15). Mary's senses were no longer very clear. Formerly, she knew Him by using her ears. Her ears had not changed, but they no longer worked when she tried to identify Him according to her ears. Formerly, her eyes could identify Him. Her eyes had not changed, but they could not identify the Lord Jesus anymore. She had not changed, but Jesus of Nazareth had changed. Mary was still the same Mary, but Jesus of Nazareth had risen from the dead. Her ears, eyes, and understanding had now become useless. According to the old ways it was possible to know the earthly Lord Jesus in the flesh. But it was no longer possible to know the resurrected, spiritual, and heavenly Lord Jesus, who now lived in the Spirit. Mary had not changed. The Lord Jesus had changed. Because the Lord had changed, there had to be a change on Mary's part before she could know the changed Jesus. She had to have a new revelation before she could have a fresh knowledge of the Lord.</p><p>"Jesus said to her, Mary! She turned and said to Him in Hebrew, Rabboni!" (v. 16). It is strange that as soon as the Lord mentioned her name, Mary recognized the Lord. This calling of her name by the Lord is a kind of revelation. What is a revelation? A revelation is not the Lord standing there and saying, "I am Jesus." A revelation is when a person suddenly and inexplicably comes to know the Lord. When the Lord Jesus called, "Mary," she did not come to know that her name was Mary. When the Lord called, "Mary," she realized that this was Rabboni. The Lord did not say anything to her; all He did was call her name, and she became clear within. She received inward knowledge. This is the meaning of a revelation.</p><p>Here we see an important principle. Revelation does not come through the ears, the eyes, or any other power of perception. Revelation is a mysterious thing; it is a knowledge beyond the power of comprehension of the ears and eyes. It is a mysterious kind of knowledge. This is revelation.</p><p>After Mary knew the Lord, she hurried to the disciples to tell them about it. Although the disciples heard it, they were still bewildered.</p><h2 class="head1">THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE LORD<br />OF THE TWO DISCIPLES ON THE WAY TO EMMAUS</h2><p>After the Lord's resurrection, two of the disciples went to Emmaus. On the way they were talking to each other concerning all the things which had occurred, that is, about the things concerning the Lord Jesus which Mary had related. At that moment, the Lord Jesus Himself drew near to them. Yet their eyes were kept from recognizing Him; they did not know the resurrected Lord. They knew the Jesus who was in the flesh. But they did not know the Lord who had resurrected. Resurrection was a mysterious thing to them, and they could not believe in it.</p><p>The Lord conversed with them, taught them, and clearly explained to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself, beginning from Moses and from all the prophets. Yet they still did not know Him. Although they understood the teachings of the Scriptures and were touched and even burning in their hearts, they still did not know the Lord Jesus. This shows us that doctrines and revelation are two different things. They understood the Scriptures, but they did not know the Lord. They knew the teachings about Christ, but they did not know Christ.</p><p>When it was near evening and they were coming close to Emmaus, they constrained Him to stay with them. As they reclined at table, Jesus took the loaf and handed it to them. Then their eyes were opened, and they recognized Him. This shows us clearly that there are two kinds of knowledge of the Lord. One kind of knowledge is from the Bible, while the other kind of knowledge comes when the Lord opens men's eyes. Some are very familiar with the Scriptures and can even speak to others about them, but they do not know the Lord Jesus. Others know not only the scriptural teachings, but their eyes have been opened by the Lord and they know the Lord Jesus also. These are two very different things. We must realize that Christianity does not have only the Bible but also personal revelations. It is true that without the Bible, there would be no Christianity in the world. But we have to remember that without revelation, we do not have a personal Christ.</p><p>One problem among God's children is that much of their knowledge is "transmitted" knowledge; it is transmitted from one's mouth to another's ear. One man understands with his mind and transmits it into another man's ear. Everything is transmitted, and hence everything is just a doctrine and teaching. We must remember that it is useless to have Bible knowledge without knowing the Lord. The two disciples that were on the way to Emmaus knew the Scriptures already, and while the Lord was talking with them and explaining the Scriptures to them on the way, their hearts were burning. Yet they still did not know the Lord. The only true knowledge of the Lord is inward knowledge. Do you have such an inward knowledge of the Lord?</p><h2 class="head1">THE SEVEN DISCIPLES' KNOWLEDGE OF THE LORD</h2><p>One day, "Simon Peter and Thomas, called Didymus, and Nathanael from Cana of Galilee and the sons of Zebedee and two others of His disciples were there together. Simon Peter said to them, I am going fishing. They said to him, We also are coming with you" (John 21:2-3). It is strange that they were good fishermen, yet once they had followed the Lord, they could not catch anything when they went back to fish. They caught nothing during the whole night. Even more strange is the fact that as the morning broke, when Jesus stood on the shore, they did not recognize Him. The resurrected Lord Jesus cannot be recognized by human eyes. Peter, John, and James had been with the Lord all the time. Nathanael was one of the earliest ones who knew the Lord. As for Thomas, the Lord even purposely manifested Himself to him in order to remove his disbelief of His resurrection. Yet now, they all failed to know Him. They needed another experience and another power before they could know Him. "Then Jesus said to them, Little children, you do not have any fish to eat, do you? They answered Him, No. And He said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some. They cast therefore, and they were no longer able to haul it in because of the abundance of fish" (vv. 5-6). Then what happened? John, the disciple who reclined on the Lord's breast, recognized that it was the Lord, and he said to Peter, "It is the Lord!" When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put his outer garment around himself and threw himself into the sea. A minute earlier they heard Him and saw Him, yet they did not know that it was the Lord. Now suddenly they knew; they knew in a mysterious way. This knowledge is Christianity. This knowledge is unshakeable; it is an inward seeing, an inward knowledge, and an inward strength. This knowledge gave Peter renewed strength.</p><p>"When they got out onto the land, they saw a fire of coals laid there, and fish lying on it and bread. Jesus said to them, Bring some of the fish that you have just now caught" (vv. 9-10). None of the disciples dared to ask who He was, knowing that it was the Lord. Do you not feel that this word is quite ambiguous? If they knew that it was the Lord, they no longer needed to ask Him. They were not without questions; they were just too afraid to ask. They dared not inquire of Him. This means that they did not know, yet they dared not ask because they were afraid. Yet it says that although no one dared to inquire of Him, they all knew that it was the Lord. They did not know it outwardly, but they knew it inwardly. Outwardly they were still wondering who this man was. Yet inwardly, they knew that it was the Lord. They may have said, "I do not know Him when I see His face. I do not know Him when I hear His voice. In my mind, I want to ask Him who He is. But in my heart I do not need to ask Him because I already know that He is the Lord." Have you ever had this experience&mdash;on the one hand, you do not know anything, but on the other hand, you are very clear? This is the experience of many Christians. We are not clear about many things and are bewildered about many things. But at the same time, we are very clear. This is the meaning of revelation. Revelation makes a person clear within; it is knowing something within. Blessed are those who walk according to revelation! Blessed are those who know the Lord according to revelation! Only they have power before the Lord, and only they know what the Lord can do.</p><p>Outward knowledge cannot replace inward revelation. We must have an inward knowledge of the Lord. Once we have inward knowledge, no one can shake us. May the Lord open our eyes to realize what we cannot realize otherwise. With our mind and our senses, we can only know Jesus in the flesh; this knowledge is not that useful to us and does not give us any strength. May the Lord truly reveal His Son in us so that we can be clear within, have inward knowledge and understanding, and have no doubt whatsoever within us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class="title">BLESSINGS THAT CAN BE ENJOYED TODAY</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Isa. 49:10; Rev. 7:9-17</h1><p>These two passages mention a few kinds of blessings: (1) not hungering or thirsting, (2) not having the scorching heat nor sun strike them, (3) being guided to springs of water, and (4) God wiping away every tear. The first three blessings are mentioned in both passages, while the fourth is mentioned only in Revelation.</p><p>Revelation records a great multitude which no one could number standing before the throne and before the Lamb. John did not understand who they were. Later, one of the elders asked him, "These who are clothed in the white robes, who are they, and where did they come from?" (Rev. 7:13). John answered, "My lord, you know" (v. 14). The elder then said, "These are those who come out of the great tribulation, and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb" (v. 14). He also told John the four kinds of blessings these ones have.</p><p>Revelation 4:2 says, "There was a throne set in heaven." The throne is in heaven. To say that these people are standing before the throne means that these ones are in heaven. How do they move from earth to heaven? Who are they? These ones are "clothed in white robes" with "palm branches in their hands." Palm branches signify victory. Hence, they are the overcoming believers who are raptured to heaven.</p><p>"These are those who come out of the great tribulation." The "great tribulation" here is not the great tribulation of the three and a half years but the "affliction" referred to by the Lord when He says, "In the world you have affliction" (John 16:33). It is called the "great tribulation" because the twelve apostles, Stephen, Paul, and all the ones who came after them suffered the same tribulation.</p><p>These overcoming believers will enjoy a few special blessings. They stand before the throne of God; this means that these blessings are eternal blessings in the heavenlies. It is obvious that Revelation 7:16-17 speaks of the condition in eternity.</p><p>Apparently, the blessings mentioned in Isaiah 49:10 are the same as the ones mentioned here. Actually, there are some differences. What are the differences? Isaiah 49:6 says, "It is too small a thing that You would be My Servant/To raise up the tribes of Jacob/And bring back the preserved of Israel;/I will also set You as a light of the nations/That You may be My salvation unto the ends of the earth." Has this verse been fulfilled yet? Acts 13:47 says, "I have set you as a light of the Gentiles, that you would be for salvation unto the uttermost part of the earth." From this we see that Isaiah 49:6 has been fulfilled. God has made Jesus Christ the light of the Gentiles. This is a picture of today. This is the condition of the age of the gospel.</p><p>Furthermore, Isaiah 49:8 says, "In an acceptable time I have answered You,/And in a day of salvation I have helped You." If we compare this with 2 Corinthians 6:2, we will see that Isaiah 49:8 also refers to the present time.</p><p>Since Isaiah 49:6 and 8 refer to the present time, we can say that verse 10 must also refer to the present time. This is in contrast with Revelation 7, which refers to eternity future.</p><p>God does not expect us to enjoy these blessings only when we reach heaven. He expects us to have a foretaste of heaven even now. Although we cannot have a full taste of it, at least we can enjoy three-quarters of it. We know that when we reach heaven, surely we will not hunger or thirst anymore or suffer the heat but will be guided to the springs of water. Why then do we not believe that we can enjoy these things today? God says that we can enjoy these three kinds of blessings even today!</p><p>These ones "will come from a distance/...from the north and the west/And others from the land of the Sinim" (Isa. 49:12). While they are suffering on the way, God promises that "they will not hunger or thirst;/Neither the scorching heat nor the sun will strike them;/For He who has compassion on them will lead them/And will guide them beside the springs of water." God has given us such wonderful promises. We are these pilgrims; we have left our earthly homes and are on our way to the New Jerusalem.</p><h2 class="head1">THEY WILL NOT HUNGER OR THIRST</h2><p>To hunger and thirst is to have a hope that is not yet satisfied. Who are the ones who will not hunger and thirst? "Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst" (John 6:35). "But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water gushing up into eternal life" (4:14). Christ promises that everyone who believes in Him will be satisfied and receive a satisfying life. It is not us satisfying ourselves with Christ but Christ becoming our satisfaction. The world can only satisfy us temporarily; it can only satisfy us for a moment. It cannot satisfy us forever. "Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever" (vv. 13-14). This is the Lord's word.</p><p>God does not say that we can be satisfied only when we reach heaven. We can be satisfied even today. Do we believe that we will not hunger and thirst today, just as we will not be hungry and thirsty in heaven? Today the Lord Jesus can satisfy our heart as much as He will satisfy us on that day in heaven. The Lord said, "But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever." Once we drink, we are satisfied. This satisfying life can be ours today.</p><h2 class="head1">NEITHER WILL THE SCORCHING HEAT <br />NOR SUN STRIKE THEM</h2><p>Those who live in subtropical lands do not feel the scorching of the heat and the sun. But if one travels to tropical lands, he will realize the intensity of the striking from the heat and the sun. A brother once said that when a man walks out of the house without his umbrella in a tropical country, he will be sick for a few months. Once three people went to a certain land. Two of them died of heat on the way; only one survived. However, if one is inside a house, he will not be hurt by the sun because there is a shelter. Without a shelter, one will be hurt by the heat. The Bible mentions God's overshadowing as a kind of shelter. There is one kind of life that is under God's overshadowing; it is a life that is hidden in God (Psa. 36:7-9).</p><p>Are you sheltered? In spiritual warfare, we have the helmet of salvation (Eph. 6:17). Our life is a hidden life. We are hidden under God's wings on earth today as little chickens are hidden under the wings of their mother. In Psalm 91, we find that those who dwell "in the secret place of the Most High/Will abide in the shadow of the Almighty" (v. 1). The Lord will deliver these ones from many perils. This is a blessed life. We are a sheltered people.</p><h2 class="head1">HE WHO HAS MERCY ON THEM WILL SHEPHERD<br />AND GUIDE THEM TO SPRINGS OF WATERS OF LIFE</h2><p>Springs are with God (Psa. 87:7), while the river of water of life flows from the throne of God and of the Lamb (Rev. 22:1). In other words, we are very close to God; we are right beside Him. God leads us to His presence, and the Lamb shepherds us. To put it another way, it is the Lamb who shepherds; it is Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who feeds the lambs with His experience as the Lamb of God. We can never improve ourselves. We need a Shepherd to feed us all the time. What a restful enjoyment this is! This again is something that we can enjoy today.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD WILL WIPE AWAY EVERY TEAR FROM THEIR EYES</h2><p>Today we can enjoy the three blessings above. But this does not mean that we will have no tears. We have to wait until we reach heaven before our tears will be wiped away. Isaiah 49:10 does not mention this kind of blessing because it records the condition on earth. Our Lord Jesus was completely restful while He was on earth; He could walk through all difficulties. Yet He wept beside the tomb of Lazarus, and He also wept on His way to Jerusalem. Finally, He wept in Gethsemane. Hebrews 5 says that He prayed "with strong crying and tears" (v. 7). This shows that tears are unavoidable in this age. However, our tears are put into God's bottle and recorded in His book (Psa. 56:8). One Christian said that even though tears are bitter, God remembers them; therefore, they are a blessing!</p><p>Although we cannot avoid tears today, if we believe in God's word, we can be satisfied, and we can have God's sheltering and the Lord's shepherding. God has promised that we can enjoy these three items of blessings today.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class="title">GOD'S KEEPING POWER</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Thes. 5:23; Num. 13:25-33; 14:4-10; Josh. 14:6-12</h1><p>It is a distressing fact that some Christians believe in God's saving power, but they do not believe in His keeping power. They have received God's saving grace but have not yet received His keeping grace. They do not realize that He who is the Giver of grace is also the One who maintains us in His grace. Let us see from the Scriptures how we who have been saved by God can be kept by Him.</p><p>Joshua 14:11 says, "I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come in." This is Caleb's word. "To go out, and to come in" refers to everyday life; "for war" refers to life under exceptional circumstances. Caleb's strength was the same as it was in the day he spoke with Moses, in coping with the ordinary demands of daily life as well as with the demands of life under conditions of special stress. Though forty years had elapsed in the interval, he was as strong as he had been in his earlier days. Here we see God's keeping power. Caleb's strength was the same on that day as it was forty years earlier. He was as strong at this time as he was then. He was no less vigorous at eighty-five than he had been at forty. There is only one explanation for this; he had been kept by God. We are totally unable to keep ourselves in the grace of God. There is no guarantee that even five years after we have been saved we will be found in the measure of faith we had in our earlier Christian life. We cannot abide in the grace of God by our own effort; He alone can maintain us in His grace.</p><p>What was the condition for Caleb to experience God's keeping power? Let us consider this matter for a minute. Joshua 14:14 says, "He wholly followed the Lord God of Israel." And how did he wholly follow the Lord? We are told in Numbers 13 and 14. Numbers 13:30 says, "Caleb quieted the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once and possess it; for we are well able to prevail." "We are well able to prevail." A person who wholly follows the Lord is one who believes that the promises of God are trustworthy, that He is with His people, and that they are well able to overcome. Brothers and sisters, do you believe this? Many people believe, but their faith is a vacillating faith. They are very timid. They sing their song of praise, but though the words are right, there is something wrong with the tune. In Caleb's case it was not so; he sang the right words in the right tune. He said, "Let us go up at once." A person who wholly follows the Lord and reckons Him to be trustworthy is one who does the will of God and does it at once.</p><p>What about the ten spies? They looked at the inhabitants of the land and saw that they were "men of great size" and their cities were "fortified and very large." They looked at themselves too, and in their own sight they were "like grasshoppers." Their eyes were fixed on the difficulties before them. Herein lies the reason why so many Christians fail to experience God's keeping power&mdash;difficulties fill their vision. If one keeps looking at his difficulties, he will surely find no hope in the situation. God does not want us to set our eyes on the mountains obstructing our path; He wants us to say to the mountains: "Be taken up and cast into the sea" (Mark 11:23). It is useless to set our eyes on the mountains. The more we look at the mountains, the higher they become. Many people cannot overcome because their eyes are always set on their failures. Many people are prepared ahead of time for their failures. Defeat is certain if we are constantly contemplating defeat. Many experiences of failure come because we anticipate them. We may think that we can deal with other problems but that there is no way that we can deal with one particular problem. In so thinking, we have paved the way for defeat as soon as the problem comes to us. As soon as our eyes are set on ourselves, we will surely fail. If God is to save us, He must first save our eyes from looking at ourselves to looking at His promises. We are courageous only as long as we keep God's promises in view. Once we see His promises, we will see that we can overcome!</p><p>So many of God's people lack the faith that characterized Caleb; they concentrate their thoughts on the seriousness of their illnesses, the intensity of their scars, and the insurmountable nature of their difficulties. Yet how many are there whose eyes are set on God's promises? Those who do not fear "the children of Anak" are "well able to prevail." Caleb requested Joshua to appoint Hebron as his portion; Hebron was a great city among the Anakim, and the great man among the Anakim lived there (Josh. 14:12-15). He was not dismayed by the fact that the Anakim were "men of great size," nor by the fact that Hebron was "fortified and very large"; he overcame them. The whole question in relation to overcoming is: Are we trusting in ourselves, or are we trusting in the Lord? If we are relying on ourselves then of course we have to consider whether or not the Anakim are strong or weak and whether their cities are well fortified, but if our reliance is on God, then the question of human resources does not even arise. If we are trusting in God, there is no ground for fear, and victory is assured no matter how great the men and how high the city may be.</p><p>There is another noteworthy matter in connection with Caleb. In Numbers 14:9 he exhorted the whole congregation of the children of Israel, saying: "Do not rebel against Jehovah; and do not fear the people of the land, for they will be our bread." He told the Israelites that they could go up immediately, they could overcome, and they did not have to be afraid of them, because "they will be our bread." Bread is something to eat. Bread is something that brings increased strength, that makes one stronger after he eats it. The inhabitants of the land were admittedly "men of great size," but in Caleb's eyes, they were food for God's people. He not only honored God's promises, he despised all the difficulties. Everyone who has genuine faith honors God and lightly esteems all difficulties. But this leaves no room for pride, for only those who humble themselves before God will be able to stand upon His victory.</p><p>Every time you meet a difficulty, every time you find yourself in an impossible situation, ask yourself this question: Am I going to starve here, or am I going to eat? If you are relying on the Lord for victory and allow His overcoming life to be manifested in you, you will find fresh nourishment and increased vitality, and you will be fed once again. Bear in mind that people who do not eat well cannot grow into maturity. Our bread is not only the word of God, our meat is not only to do His will, our bread is also the Anakim&mdash;the difficulties that are in our way. Many people take the word of God as their bread and the doing of His will as their meat, but they have not eaten the Anakim. Many eat too little of the Anakim. The more we eat the Anakim, the stronger we will become. Caleb is a grand illustration of this. Because he accepted the Anakim as "bread," he was still full of vitality at the age of eighty-five. His strength was the same at eighty-five as it was at forty. So many Anakim had been assimilated by him over the years that he had developed a constitution which showed no trace of age. This is also true in the spiritual realm. Some brothers and sisters have met few difficulties, but it is obvious that there are many weaknesses in their lives. They are weak before the Lord because they have not consumed enough Anakim. However, there are those who have met and overcome difficulty after difficulty, temptation after temptation; they are full of vigor because they have fed well on Anakim. We have to eat our difficulties and our temptation. Every difficulty and every temptation Satan puts in our way is food for us. This is a God-appointed means of spiritual progress. The sight of any trouble strikes terror into the heart of those who do not have faith, but those who trust Him say, "Here comes my food!" Praise and thank the Lord, all our trials, without exception, are bread for us. Every trial brings in growth after we have eaten of it. As we accept one trial after another, we are more and more richly nourished.</p><p>Let us now look into the practical outworking of this. We must not forget that there is a condition attached to God's keeping power. If we do not trust Him, He is unable to keep us. In order to experience His salvation, and in order to have His keeping power, we must believe wholeheartedly in His promises. If after we have overcome, we doubt whether our overcoming experience can be sustained, we are discrediting His keeping power. We must believe in God's keeping power. Every morning when we rise we should say to Him, "God, I thank You for keeping me yesterday, and today You will still keep me. I do not know what temptations may befall me, and I do not know how I can overcome. I cannot do anything; but I believe You will keep me." First Peter 1:5 speaks of being "guarded by the power of God through faith." God guards those who have faith in Him. We do not have to grapple with temptations and try to overcome them; the keeping power of God will get us through, and we must believe in His ability to save us from giving way to sin. If we implicitly rely on Him, even when we are unexpectedly assailed by temptations, an amazing thing will happen. In a way we cannot account for, something will ward off all the fiery darts of the evil one. It is the shield of faith. It will come in between us and Satan, so that his fiery darts cannot reach us. Instead of hurting us they will beat upon the shield of faith and rebound on Satan himself.</p><p>Paul said, "I am persuaded that He is able to guard my deposit unto that day" (2 Tim. 1:12). Paul did something; he committed himself to the Lord. If you believe in Him, then you must commit yourself to Him. He can only keep those who have handed themselves over to Him. Many people fail to experience the blessedness of His keeping power because they have never put themselves into His care. They have never said to Him, "Lord, I hand myself over to you and commit to You the keeping of my life." Brothers and sisters, have you placed yourselves in His hands? If you truly have, then you will be able to say with Paul, "I am persuaded that He is able to guard my deposit unto that day."</p><p>If your life is truly in His hands, then the promise of Jude 24&mdash;"to guard you from stumbling and to set you before His glory without blemish in exultation"&mdash;will be fulfilled in you. To stumble is to slip and strike against something when we are unconscious of any obstruction in the way. Praise God, He will preserve us not only from falling but also from the slightest slippage. Thank and praise the Lord, His preserving grace operates beyond the realm of our consciousness. Brothers and sisters, if we commit ourselves unreservedly into His care, we will marvel at the way we are kept. When temptation suddenly assails and love is required, we will find love spontaneously welling up from within. When a sudden temptation demands patience, without giving it a moment's thought, our patience will rise up to meet the need. Praise God, as the life we received from Adam spontaneously expresses itself, so also does the life we receive from Christ. We inherited our bad temper from Adam, and we can become angry without the slightest effort of will. We inherited pride from Adam, and we can become proud without any deliberate decision. In the same way, those who have received the life of Christ and committed themselves into His keeping can be meek without making up their minds to be meek, and humble without any effort to be humble. The same spontaneity of manifestation that characterizes the life we have received from Adam also characterizes the life we have received from Christ. To work out what the Lord Jesus has given us does not require any effort on our part. If we trust in His promises and commit ourselves utterly to Him, we will be kept from this day to the day of His return, and we will be kept without blemish. Thank God, we have a salvation which is worthy of our trust and which will withstand every trial.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">PUTTING ON THE HELMET OF SALVATION</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 2:9, 17; 3:6-7; 2 Cor. 1:12; Eph. 6:17; 4:23; Rom. 12:2; 8:5-6</h1><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>In the garden of Eden, there were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God commanded Adam saying, "Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die" (Gen. 2:16-17). This shows us that these two trees are in opposition one to another. On one side, there is the tree of life. On the other side, there is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, a tree that leads to death. We can say that one is the tree of life and the other is the tree of death. When man ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the result was death. The greatest effect on Adam and Eve after they had sinned was that they acquired knowledge. After they ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, they understood good and evil. In other words, the influence of the fall on man's physiological constitution and the first subjective impact it had on man was that man's intellect became bigger than before. Before man fell, he had a mind and an intellect. But after his fall, his mind and intellect became different from what God had intended them to be at the beginning; they were no longer what God wanted them to be. For this reason, Paul said in Ephesians 6:17 that we should "receive the helmet of salvation." This shows that man's "head" needs salvation. After many people believe in the Lord, their life and their living are definitely changed. But with many people their "head" is not yet saved. In spiritual warfare, if our "head" is not saved and covered, we cannot deal with Satan. Therefore, it is important to put on the helmet of salvation; it is important for our "head" to be saved.</p><p>Among God's children, there is a great problem: we can find excellent men, and we can find men with good behavior, but they all have a "head" that belongs to the old creation. In other words, they have the life of Christ, but they still have the "head" of Adam. This frustrates them from understanding God's will. To measure a person's spiritual life, all we have to do is measure his "head." The degree to which a man is saved from his "head" is the degree to which he is saved from Adam and the old creation. The basic difference between living in the old creation and living in the new creation lies in the condition of the "head" before God.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>Second Corinthians 1:12 says, "Not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world." All of us who consider ourselves to be clever, shrewd, and great need to look to God for His deliverance. We need to realize that the principle of the Christian life is to be according to God's will and not according to our wisdom. It is trusting in His grace rather than in our wisdom. This is the one thing that we have to learn.</p><p>Suppose a matter is presented to you, and you do not know whether you should do it, or you do not know how to do it in the proper way. You consider and reconsider, pondering this way and that. You think if you do it this way, you will have this result, and if you do it that way, you will have that result. If you say this, others will answer in one way, and if you say that, others will answer in another way. You think you should be a little more clever in handling the situation. What does it mean to be clever? It means to face the least difficulty and avoid the most opposition in saying or doing something. But you have forgotten that God's children do not live on earth in fleshly wisdom. Being a Christian is a simple thing. All we need to do is ask what God wants.</p><p>We must realize that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil that was in the garden of Eden is still growing among God's children today. Many of God's children are still eating the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil day and night instead of the fruit of the tree of life. They still ask if they should do this or that, and they are still entangled with questions of good and evil. Paul said that it is a simple matter to live before God; we do not live in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God. We are responsible for one thing only, doing His will.</p><h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>Romans 12:2 says, "But be transformed by the renewing of the mind that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and well pleasing and perfect." We must all remember that our responsibility is to obey God's will, while God is responsible for the result of our obedience to His will. We do not have the responsibility of finding a smooth pathway for ourselves. As far as smoothness is concerned, we can say that the Son of God lived the roughest life on earth. He was responsible for obeying God's will, while God was responsible for His "misfortunes." When we say that cleverness is useless to a Christian, we do not mean that we should go and do foolish things. Our cleverness is useless in God's hand, and our foolishness is also useless in His hand. God has no need of our foolishness just as He has no need of our cleverness. We are not saying that foolish things are good; we are saying that whatever is according to God's will is good. We have to differentiate between the two. Purposely saying foolish things or purposely making a blunder does not make a person better. We have to be responsible for obeying God's will. If God wants us to do something, we should do it. The result and effect of that action is God's business, not ours.</p><p>We need to ask God to save us from our "head," so that our "head" has salvation and we have on the helmet of salvation. Whenever we encounter anything, the first thing we should do is confess to God: "Lord, my head and my cleverness are not the principles by which I live my Christian life. As a Christian, everything I do is for the purpose of fulfilling Your will." This does not mean that we have to act foolishly or become a fool. I will repeat again that God does not need a foolish man, just as He does not need a clever man. We should not live in this world according to what our mind thinks; rather, we should prove what is God's good and well pleasing and perfect will.</p><p>Some people have a commercial mentality. Whenever they encounter something, the first thing that comes into their mind is a calculation of gains and losses. They do this in ordinary matters, and they do this also in spiritual matters. This kind of mentality needs to receive a warning. In spiritual matters, the main thing is not whether one comes out on top; it is not a question of personal gain or loss, but a question of God's will. Brothers and sisters, we have to learn that in this world we live by only one principle: trusting in God's grace and doing His will.</p><h2 class="head1">FOUR</h2><p>Ephesians 4:23 says, "And that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind." This means that man's mind needs to be renewed. Romans 12 speaks of the same thing: "Be transformed by the renewing of the mind." The result is "that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and well pleasing and perfect." If our mind is renewed, we will prove what God's will is. Whether or not a man understands God's will has nothing to do with methods; it has to do with the person himself. Many people know methods for finding out God's will, but they themselves are wrong. As a result, they still are unable to know God's will.</p><p>Who will know God's will? Only those who have been delivered by God from their mental strength know His will. Our mind must be renewed before we can prove what God's will is. We have to remember that the strongest part of man's natural life is his thoughts. With some, the strength of their natural life lies in their will. With others, the strength of their natural life lies in their emotion. But with most, the strength of their natural life lies in their mind. As soon as you meet a person who is strong in his mind, you touch his "head." When he comes to you, his thoughts come as well. His thoughts are stronger than his spirit. He seems very clever, and his outstanding feature is his thoughts. But unless the Lord breaks this strength and smashes this power, such a person cannot know God's will. We have to ask God to deliver us from trusting in our mind or our mental ability.</p><p>Many people constantly confess that their flesh is wrong and that their natural life is not proper, yet they still treasure their thoughts, their views, and their natural life. They say with their mouth that they do not trust in these things, but their heart is still full of their own ideas and cleverness, and they still think that their views and ways are better than others. Their cleverness has not yet been broken, and their thoughts have not yet been dealt with. Therefore, they cannot know God's will. Many people are full of God's will in their mouth, yet in reality, they know nothing about God's will. We know that a wrong person will never know God's will. God needs to do a fundamental work in us through the cross. In particular, He has to renew our mind. He has to break our old man so that we will no longer appreciate our own cleverness and no longer think that we are better than others. Once our "head" is dealt with, we will prove God's will, and we will know His will. Our problem is that human thoughts often have replaced God's will. Therefore, our "head" needs to be saved. No one who is ignorant of the cross will know God's will. Hence, the whole question comes back to the cross. Do you know that the cross is here to deal with your natural life? Do you know how God deals with you as a person? One day God will grant you grace and lead you to the point where you realize that your self as well as your thoughts are not reliable. Then you will no longer believe in yourself or treasure your natural strength. Then many things will become clear to you. Whenever your natural life is dealt with by God, you will be clear concerning His will.</p><h2 class="head1">FIVE</h2><p>Romans 8:5-6 says, "For those who are according to the flesh mind the things of the flesh; but those who are according to the spirit, the things of the Spirit. For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace." What is the mind of the flesh? One characteristic of the mind of the flesh is to believe in ourselves, to think that we know everything, and to be confident of everything. The mind of the spirit also has its characteristic, which is to have no trust in ourselves, to be hesitant and fearful in saying or doing anything. The mind of the flesh is always busy and quick; it always considers itself to be very clever. Yet it does not have any rest, and the result is death. The mind of the spirit is not under the control of natural wisdom; it is under the control of God's command. It does not have any confidence in the flesh and does not act according to the idea of the mind. The result is life and peace. Hence, our "head" must be saved before we can be free from the control of the fleshly mind and before we can have the mind of the spirit. Only then will we have life and peace.</p><h2 class="head1">SIX</h2><p>Paul said, "Not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you" (1 Cor. 1:12). Please pay attention to the last phrase "and more abundantly toward you." The Corinthians were very wise. But Paul said that he did not conduct himself in the world in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God and more abundantly toward them. Thank the Lord that the more wise and judicious we are, the more we do not need to use our wisdom. We trust in the grace of God. This is all the more true when it comes to the things of God and the affairs of the church; we do not need fleshly wisdom or fleshly cleverness.</p><p>We have to learn to never bring our secular mind into the consideration of spiritual affairs. I do not know if your secular mind is useful in other things or not, but I do know one thing, a secular mind is definitely not useful in spiritual things. Your secular ways, tactics, strategies, and cleverness may be useful in other things, but they are absolutely useless in spiritual things. In the house of God, it is not a matter of man's ways or cleverness but a matter of God's will. Only one thing counts here; it is not what man says or thinks but what God has said. We need to ask the Lord, "God, what is the pattern that You want to show me?" Other than the pattern that He shows us, we cannot have another pattern. We have to learn to obey God's will and give up trusting in our own wisdom. While we are obeying God's will, we should look to Him to carry us through all the difficulties that we face in doing His will. From now on, we should look to God so that we can conduct ourselves in the world not in fleshly wisdom but in His grace and so we can obey His will.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">THREE MAIN PRINCIPLES OF OUR LIVING<br />IN THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 1:18; 1 Cor. 12:14-26</h1><p>There are many members in the Body of Christ, and the members are one, each having their different function. God has not ordered all the members to have the same function. All the members are different. "For just as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function" (Rom. 12:4). How then can these members with different functions be linked and fitted together harmoniously in one Body? There are three basic principles which are essential for the harmonious functioning of the Body of Christ. The first defines the relationship between the Head and the members, the second, the relationship between the Body and the members, and the third, the responsibility of the members. All three principles are indispensable.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />THE HEAD (CHRIST) AND THE MEMBERS&mdash;<br />OBEDIENCE</h2><p>The meaning of a Christian's absolute surrender is in the words, "I will be obedient to the Lord; I will renounce my freedom and will not disobey authority." The first principle of living in the Body of Christ is to obey the authority of the Head. Both the existence of the Body and the function and activity of the Body depend on authority. Whenever authority has no place in us, the Body is paralyzed. Any part that is disobedient is paralyzed. A paralyzed body does not follow the directions of the head; where there is life, there is authority. If we want to have life, it is impossible to reject authority. Those who are full of life must obey authority. If my hand has life, it cannot resist the direction of the head. To be alive implies that we are being directed by the Head. Therefore, the first principle of living in the Body of Christ is to obey the Head. If we have not yet been dealt with in such a way as to be rendered obedient, what we know of the Body is only a matter of theory, not of life. God must deal with our fleshly life that we may see how blessed it is to be obedient to the Head. We must aim at obedience. Many times, we seek for opportunities to make good progress, to become holy, and to become righteous. We should similarly seek for opportunities to be obedient.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />THE BODY (THE CHURCH) AND THE MEMBERS&mdash;<br />FELLOWSHIP</h2><p>Our relationship with the Head is that of obedience, while our relationship with the Body is that of fellowship. Among the children of God, fellowship is a matter of reality and necessity. The life of the Body of Christ needs fellowship, without which there is only death. What is fellowship? Fellowship implies receiving of assistance from other members of the Body. For instance, I am the mouth; I can speak. But I need the fellowship of the ears in order to hear. I need the fellowship of the eyes to see. I need the fellowship of the hands to take things. I also need the fellowship of the feet to walk. Therefore, fellowship means that I receive a benefit from the special features of others.</p><p>Some Christians do not understand the principle of fellowship. They want to seek spirituality as individuals, to pray by themselves, to do everything by themselves, to be the mouth, the ears, the hands, and the feet at the same time. But those who know the Lord are not so; they need fellowship. Fellowship implies the fact that we are limited, inadequate, and willing to accept what comes from others and take it as our own.</p><p>Fellowship is not a mere doctrine but a reality. In the three hundred and sixty-five days of the year, can we honestly say that we pray well every day? Can we honestly say that we study the Bible well every day? Experience tells us that occasionally on account of poor health or for other reasons we cannot pray or read the Bible well. Then do we fail? Do we fall? No. During the week we can have fellowship with God on Monday and do reasonably well on Tuesday through Friday. On Saturday, we may feel tired and unable to read the Bible or pray well. Yet we are not doomed to failure on Saturday because there is an inexplicable strength supporting us. Saturday need not be any worse than the day before. This is because there is a supply from the life of the Body.</p><p>Many children of God have a similar experience, not once or twice but many times. Though we are weak, God carries us through because the members of the Body can mutually supply the needs of each other. Someone is praying, "May God be gracious to all His children." As life from another member of the Body flows into us, we are sustained. The life from the Body flows into us and carries us through. So we must realize that we live not merely by our own life but through the life that comes from the Body.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RESPONSIBILITY<br />OF THE MEMBERS IN THE BODY&mdash;<br />SERVICE</h2><p>If we see that the life of the Body is a matter of fellowship and mutual supply, we will realize that before the Lord we should not be one who consumes life but one who supplies life. If many members in the Body of Christ need the supply of life and few can afford to give the supply, the strength of the Body will fail. Therefore, we must pray for others. God will supply life to other members through this prayer. Thus, when the need in others arises, such supply will be forthcoming.</p><p>First Corinthians 12:26 says, "And whether one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or one member is glorified, all the members rejoice with it." This verse does not say that when one member suffers, all the members "ought to" suffer with it, or if one member is glorified, all the members "ought to" rejoice with it. With God's Word there is not a question of what "ought to" be done. God's Word says that when one member suffers, all the members suffer; this is a fact. When one member is glorified, all the members rejoice; this is a fact. This explains why there are times when we have inexplicable feelings. Sometimes we feel heavy within. But after two days, it is over. There can be no other reason for this except for the fact that we are related in one Body.</p><p>At the time of the great spiritual revival in Wales, there was a sister living in another place. One day while she was with two or three others praying, there was an inexplicable power of the Spirit overflowing in her, an experience she had never had before. It continued for four or five months. She could quite effortlessly get in touch with God, as if heaven were near at hand. Then one day she read the newspapers and realized that the Welsh spiritual revival had supplied her. When one member rejoices, other members rejoice also. The Body of Christ is a living Body with organic life. Paul said, "I...fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for His Body, which is the church" (Col. 1:24). Because we are in one Body, we can fill up the needs of other members.</p><p>This is not only a matter of suffering or rejoicing; it is a matter of life. Some members can supply the Body with life, while others must receive life from the Body. We should have both aspects. We truly need the supply of life from the Body, and we should also supply life to the Body. Through fellowship we receive life from the Body, and as members we also supply life to others. When we talk of the Body, it is not a mere doctrine or teaching; the Body of Christ is an absolute fact. It is an absolute fact that God's children are joined together as members of the Body. Therefore, we must gladly receive help from others, and we should also endeavor to help other brothers and sisters.</p><p>In summary, we should yield obedience to the authority of the Lord, enjoy the life of the Body, and supply life to others. These are the three main principles of our living in the Body of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1><h1 class="title">THE FUNCTION OF THE ANOINTING</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Lev. 8:12, 30; Luke 4:18-19; Acts 10:38; 1 John 2:27; Psa. 133:1-3</h1><h2 class="head1">THE ANOINTING BEFORE GOD&mdash;CONSECRATION</h2><p>Leviticus 8 speaks of Aaron being anointed and chapter nine refers to his offering of sacrifices. Before becoming king, David was also anointed by Samuel, and then he began to serve God according to the ministry which God had bestowed upon him (1 Sam. 16:12-13). This shows us very clearly that ministry follows anointing. A person who has a ministry before God must have first received an anointing before God. This is true even of the Lord Jesus. He said, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to announce the gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to proclaim release to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to send away in release those who are oppressed, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, the year of jubilee" (Luke 4:18-19). We can see from the Word of God that a person who is useful in the hand of God must have first received the anointing before Him. One who has not received the anointing before God cannot serve or work for Him.</p><p>Having the anointing can very easily become an outward matter among the children of God. We are prone to link the anointing and power together. It is true that they are associated with each other because God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. The Holy Spirit and power do go together, and the Holy Spirit is the power of God, but the Holy Spirit becoming power upon man is just the result of the anointing; this is not God's primary purpose. It is not the thought which God has in mind at the time of anointing people. We should understand that the purpose of receiving the anointing is not to speak with tongues, to perform miracles, or to work wonders. The purpose of the anointing is to be separated and holy before God.</p><p>The anointing is referred to in many instances in the Old Testament. In the Old Testament, however, the anointing is not linked together with power. The anointing had only one significance in the Old Testament: to indicate that the person belonged to God. When I say that this book belongs to me, I affix a seal upon it; when God says that a person belongs to Him, He anoints him. Ointment is for separation as well as sanctification. To anoint means to separate unto Jehovah or to belong to Jehovah for holiness.</p><p>This kind of absolute belonging to the Lord constitutes the primary requisite for the ministry. Anyone who has a ministry before God is separated unto Jehovah. Only those separated to Jehovah can have the ministry; only they can participate in the work. Whenever consecration ceases, the work will also cease; whenever there is a change in consecration, there will be a change in the ministry.</p><p>After the Holy Spirit descended upon the Lord Jesus, God's acknowledgement, "This is My Son, the Beloved" (Matt. 3:17), came before the Lord began to work. This was God's speaking. Therefore, the anointing indicates God's ownership. Here is a person whom God can claim to be His own, and here is someone whom He can send or use. After the anointing we see power, spontaneous power. As a result the gospel was preached to the poor, sight was restored to the blind, those in bondage were delivered, and men heard of the year of jubilee, in which God accepts man.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ANOINTING TO OTHERS&mdash;POWER</h2><p>God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power before the Lord Jesus went about doing good and healing those who were oppressed by the devil. God anointed Him with ointment. What is this ointment? It is the Holy Spirit, and it is also power. It is very wonderful and precious that the Holy Spirit is ointment on us and power to others. To others the Holy Spirit is experienced as power, whereas on us, it is ointment. Whenever the ointment is on us, those who come in contact with us will touch power.</p><p>If we are separated before the Lord, spontaneously we will be power to others. Power is not first but second. If the problem of consecration before God is settled, spontaneously the question of power to others is settled. Whenever there is a problem with consecration (or, in other words, with separation), there is a problem with power, and there is a problem with the work. Anointing brings in spontaneous power. This is true with David as well as with Aaron.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ANOINTING IN OURSELVES&mdash;TEACHING</h2><p>In learning to serve God, we often come across a fact: when we are going to speak, if we are doing it for God, the anointing will be upon us. We will not need to speak strenuously or painstakingly, for we are conscious of the presence of the anointing upon us. Our words may be rather common and simple, yet we become stronger as we speak and feel the presence of the anointing. When we feel this, others will sense the presence of power. At other times we may also speak, but we feel like a deflated tire; we do not feel that there is any sense in our talking, and others do not sense the presence of power. Herein lies the difference: with the anointing there is power; without the anointing there is no power. The anointing is refreshing to us and power to others.</p><p>First John 2:27 says, "And as for you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things and is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him." The scope of this verse is comprehensive because the anointing teaches us all things. The teaching of the anointing is entirely different from the teaching of men. Human teaching requires much reasoning and many words. As a result things become complicated. But the teaching of the anointing is different. The teaching of the anointing does not tell us many things or many words; it teaches us by means of His presence or absence in us. This is the characteristic of the anointing. If we do something that the Lord wants us to do, we will have the anointing once we move, and we will know that it is right. If it is something that we should not do, we will feel like a deflated tire once we do it, and we will know that we are not doing the right thing. The anointing does not instruct us by means of teaching or reasoning. If it did, our minds would have to be changed because the faculty of our mind falls far short of God's mind, and we are unable to comprehend His reasons.</p><p>Therefore, whether we are right or wrong is based on the presence or absence of the anointing; it is not based on the presence or absence of reason. All of God's children should learn one lesson, that in following God, we should not reason with Him; rather, we should see whether or not we have the refreshing of the Holy Spirit. Many times when we consider whether or not we should do something, we find good reasons for it; but when we are about to start, we feel that we are doing it alone, and the presence of the Lord is not with us. There is no anointing, and this indicates that we are wrong. For instance, if we are talking to someone and we do not have the anointing, the more we talk the more impotent and inwardly empty we will feel; we will feel dry and be like a deflated tire. However, if we have a heavy burden within, the more we speak, the more we will have an "amen" within and the more relaxed we will feel. We will know what God wants us to do. Therefore, no child of God should move if he does not feel the presence of the anointing. Once he moves, he will find that he is finished. When we are without the anointing, the more we act outwardly the colder we become inwardly, and others cannot touch anything in us either. When we feel the presence of the anointing, others feel power flowing from us. This anointing is both teaching and knowledge to us and power to others.</p><p>Many brothers seek power the same way that others seek life, but the Word of God tells us that death operates in us while life operates in others (2 Cor. 4:12). Those seeking life for themselves will not get it. When death operates in us, life operates in others. Similarly, we do not need to try to see whether or not we have power; we only need to ask whether or not we have the anointing. If the anointing is upon us, power will be in others. If we seek power in ourselves, I am afraid the power will not come; we may instead get something outward, which may be marvelous or somewhat sensational, but it is not the spiritual power spoken of in the Word of God. It is a pity that some of God's children seek for some kind of sensational power. They seek for power that they can sense and be sure of. They may think that if they have such power they will be able to help others, but this is entirely wrong. What we should pay attention to is not power but the anointing and whether we are abiding in the Lord according to its teaching. If we do not do as the anointing teaches, other people will not touch life. We may speak many words which people like to hear or consider meaningful, yet if there is no anointing, there is no spiritual reality and life. When we have the anointing before God, others will spontaneously receive help, touch life, and contact the Lord Himself.</p><p>There is another thing which we should take notice of, that the anointing is not for individuals but for the Body. It is not something that we experience as individuals. The precious ointment that was poured upon Aaron's head ran down upon the beard and went down to the skirts of his garments. In this condition one sees how good and how pleasant it is. Therefore, we should seek not only the teaching of the anointing within us but also for the teaching of the anointing in the Body of Christ. We should be guided not only by the anointing in us but the anointing in the Body of Christ. In many things the Lord is sovereignly ordering everything and leading us, and we should not act contrary to the anointing.</p><p>Let me give you an illustration. A certain brother, who was supposed to conduct a meeting, felt very empty inwardly and void of words. Therefore, he asked another brother to speak in his place. While going to the meeting, the latter felt that he should give a testimony when he spoke. He was not usually disposed to do this, but the anointing in him urged him to and so he presented his testimony. There were two people at the meeting who had been there several times to listen to the preaching. They had never understood very much, and they were not very interested in what was spoken in the meetings. In fact, they had not been to a meeting in a long time, but that night they were compelled by friends to attend. Other brothers were praying for them, asking God to give them the appropriate words. The testimony of the brother that evening turned out to be exactly what they needed. This is the guidance of the anointing within us, and this is the working of the anointing in a meeting. We should bear in mind that we can never serve God beyond the leading of the anointing within us. However much the anointing is in us, we should serve God to that limit. Going beyond our limit hinders others and damages them. Therefore, we should keep within the limits set by the Lord.</p><p>It is after we truly know the anointing that we begin to know what is meant by the ministry of the word or what serving by means of God's word is. When the anointing is upon us, we have the word. Therefore, it is through the anointing that we serve God. It is God who turns our attention to what He pays attention to, and it is God who furnishes us with the word by which we serve Him and minister to His children.</p><p>Lastly, we hope the brothers and sisters will sincerely consecrate themselves to God because all service is based on separation. The anointing which God has bestowed on us certifies that we are His. Once we have the anointing, we will sense that we belong to God and that we are the Lord's own! Once we have the anointing, we will be conscious of what the Lord wants us to do. When we act according to the teaching of the anointing, others will sense the power. This power is not the kind of power we imagine in our mind; it is not manifested in loud voices from the pulpit or in miracles and works of wonders; it lies in the fact that while we are serving, others touch life. This power is nothing other than the anointing. May God bless us so that we may truly abide in the Lord, according to the teaching of the anointing.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">DEEP CALLS UNTO DEEP</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 42:7; Mark 4:5-6; Isa. 39:1-6; 2 Cor. 12:1-4; Acts 5:1-5</h1><p>Psalm 42:7 says, "Deep calls unto deep." Only a call from the depths can provoke a response from the depths. Nothing shallow can ever touch the depths, nor can anything superficial touch the inward parts. Only the deep will respond to the deep. Anything that does not issue from the depths cannot touch the depths. Others can respond deep within to only what issues from deep within us. When we go to a certain place and listen to a message, the only thing that touches us is something that has issued from the depths of others. If nothing comes from the depths, the help we receive is just superficial. We have to see the importance of the depths. Anything that is not from the depths will never reach the depths of others. If we have never received help or benefit in our depths, we will never have anything issuing from our depths. If we want to render spiritual help to others, something must issue from our depths. If we do not dig deep, we can never gain others. Unless our utterance is from the depths, we will not touch the depths in others, even though we gain their emotions and thoughts and make them cry or be happy or excited for a while. Only deep calls unto deep. Superficial expressions will not touch the depths of others.</p><h2 class="head1">DEEP ROOTS</h2><p>One principle in preaching and receiving the word is found in the Lord's parable of the sower. While the sower sowed, some seeds fell beside the way, some on the rocky place, some into the thorns, and some into the good earth. This shows us four different ways for man to receive the word. The Lord Jesus tells us that among these different conditions, one is the rocky place. There is a little earth on the surface, but underneath there are rocks. When the seed falls into this kind of ground, it springs up quickly, but as soon as the sun comes out, it withers because of the lack of root.</p><p>What is a root? It is growth that occurs beneath the soil. What are the leaves? They are growth that occur above the soil. In other words, roots are the hidden life, whereas leaves are the manifest life. The trouble with many Christians is that, while there is much apparent life, there is very little secret life. In other words, there is the lack of a hidden life. You have been a Christian for a number of years, have you not? Then let me ask: How much of your life is hidden from view? How much is unknown to others? You stress outward works. Yes, good works are important; but apart from that manifest expression of your life, how much of your life remains hidden? If all your spiritual life is exposed, you do not have any root. Are all your virtues before God manifested before man, or is there something more that is unknown to man? If all your experiences are manifested, then all your growth is upward; there is no downward growth. If this is the case, you are a person who has only leaves without root, and you are on shallow ground.</p><p>In our Christian life it is necessary that we learn the meaning of the Body of Christ; we must learn to have a life of the Body. On the other hand, we must learn that the life given to each member of His Body by the Lord is distinctly individual. The measure that has been given to you personally by Him needs to be guarded; otherwise, it will lose its specific character and will be of no particular use to God. If that which has been specially committed to you is exposed, it will wither.</p><p>The discourse of the Lord Jesus on the Mount was most remarkable. On the one hand He said, "You are the light of the world. It is impossible for a city situated upon a mountain to be hidden" (Matt. 5:14). It is open. On the other hand He said, "When you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your alms may be in secret;...when you pray, enter into your private room, and shut your door and pray to your Father who is in secret" (Matt. 6:3-4, 6). On the one hand, if you are a Christian, you must come right out into the open and make a public profession; on the other hand, there are Christian virtues which you should preserve from the public gaze. The Christian who parades all his virtues before men and who does not have anything in the depth of his being has no root; he will not be able to stand in the day of trial and temptation.</p><p>We have been the Lord's children many years; may the Lord open our eyes and show us the extent to which our experiences have been hidden from public view. How much would be left if what is known by man was taken away? May God work in us so that we can take root downward.</p><h2 class="head1">DEEP EXPERIENCES</h2><p>Writing to the Corinthians, Paul said, "To boast is necessary, though indeed not expedient" (2 Cor. 12:1). He admitted that it was "not profitable" (Gk.) for himself to write what he wrote in 2 Corinthians 12. But for the sake of others he had to do it; he was obliged to speak of "visions and revelations of the Lord." Brothers and sisters, this should be our attitude also. Many of us cannot stand the test of visions and revelations; as soon as we have a little experience, we blow the trumpet, and everyone knows about it. Paul knew that it was of no profit to himself to mention the Lord's visions and revelations. Why then did he mention them? He was forced to do so because some doubted his apostleship, and there were problems concerning the foundation of the Christian faith.</p><p>Did Paul disclose all his revelations? Far from it. He wrote, "I know a man [who is himself] in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body I do not know, or outside the body I do not know; God knows) such a one was caught away to the third heaven" (v. 2). He did not divulge this experience until fourteen years later. What depth there was in Paul! It would be a wonder if we could hide away something we received from God for seven years. But for fourteen years Paul never divulged his experience; for fourteen years God's church knew nothing of it; for fourteen years not one of the apostles had heard of it. Paul's roots were deep beneath the soil.</p><p>Some people would be inclined to say, "Paul, let us hear all about that experience of yours fourteen years ago. Tell us about your experience in the third heavens. It would be most helpful for us to know the whole story." But he said, "I know such a man (whether in the body or outside the body, I do not know; God knows), that he was caught away into Paradise and heard unspeakable words, which it is not allowed for a man to speak" (vv. 3-4). To this present day this experience of Paul's has not been uprooted; still no one knows about that experience.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, this matter of root is a matter of extreme importance. If you want to have Paul's work, then you need to have Paul's "root"; if you want to have Paul's outward conduct, then you need to have Paul's inner life; if you want to have Paul's manifest power, then you need to have Paul's secret experience. The trouble with Christians today is that they cannot keep any spiritual thing or any special experience undisclosed. As soon as they have a little experience, they have to tell it abroad. They live their lives before men; nothing is hidden within them. They do not have any root. May God show us Paul's experience, and may He lead us into having depth!</p><h2 class="head1">SUPERFICIAL LIVING</h2><p>In Isaiah 39 we are told that when the news of Hezekiah's sickness and recovery reached the Babylonian court, messengers were dispatched with letters and a present for Hezekiah. Hezekiah had been a recipient of the grace of God, but he was unable to stand the test of grace. God's Word says, "And Hezekiah was glad for them and showed them his treasury, the silver and the gold, and the spices and the precious oil, and his whole armory and everything which was found among his treasures" (v. 2). Hezekiah could not overcome the temptation to display everything. He had just been wonderfully healed of his sickness and no doubt felt self-important and thought there were few people in the world who had had such a remarkable experience as he. After all, how many had been given such a marvelous sign at the time of their healing as the shadow on the dial of Ahaz going back ten degrees (Isa. 38:8, KJV)? In his elation Hezekiah displayed all his treasures. This means that he had not passed through the dealing of the cross. His natural life was not dealt with. It was apparent that all his roots were exposed. Whatever Hezekiah knew and whatever he had were known to the Babylonians. Because of this exposure, Isaiah said to him, "Hear the word of Jehovah of hosts: Behold, the days are coming when everything which is in your house and which your fathers have laid up as a treasure unto this day will be carried away to Babylon; nothing will be left, says Jehovah" (39:5-6). The measure in which we display things to others will be the measure of our own loss. The measure in our life that we exhibit before others will be the measure we give up in ourselves. This is a solemn matter, and it demands our attention.</p><p>Alas, so many people cannot forbear disclosing their experiences! They have to speak to their heart's delight. This is like Hezekiah opening up his treasures to others. A brother once said, "Many of the brothers fall sick, and when they recover, they give their testimonies. I wish I could develop some sickness&mdash;but not a fatal one&mdash;and that God would heal me; then I would have something to say at the next testimony meeting." This brother's motive for healing was to be able to give a testimony. He sought an experience in order to have something to talk about. Oh! This superficial kind of living brings grave loss to us; it rules out the possibility of spiritual progress.</p><h2 class="head1">TESTIFYING WITHOUT EXHIBITING</h2><p>Then should we not bear testimony? Yes, we should. Paul did so, and multitudes of God's children from generation to generation have done so too. But bearing testimony is one thing; delighting in exhibiting one's experience is quite another. What is our object in testifying? Is it that others may profit or that we may have the pleasure of talking? The love of hearing one's own voice and the desire to be helpful to others are two totally different things. We testify because there is a problem, and we have to speak about it. A testimony is not an after meal conversation piece. Many times while we gossip, spiritual riches leak away. When the Lord so leads, we should testify because we want to render help to others. Paul testified in 2 Corinthians 12, but he did not lightly disclose his experience fourteen years earlier. He hid his experience for fourteen years, and no one knew about it. Even when he talked about this experience, he did not disclose everything. He only mentioned the experience; he did not relate the whole story. He only mentioned the fact that he received a revelation and heard unspeakable words. He did not tell others the words that he heard. Even today, the third heaven is still a mystery, and we still do not know what it is like.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, what are our treasures? What are our gold, silver, spices, precious ointments, and precious things? What is our armory? We have to remember that gold is everything that is of God and silver is anything that is related to the redemption of the cross. Spices are the results of our wounds, precious things are the things that relate to the kingdom, and armory is the Lord's work that we have received from God and from the Lord. All these are not doctrines, biblical teachings, or theology. These are the things we have acquired through our fellowship with the Lord. When we fellowship with God, communicate with Him, and are dealt with by Him, we pick up many things. It is wrong to speak about them loosely. This does not mean that we should not testify. But we must realize that many experiences need to be hidden. Brothers and sisters, this is a crucial matter in the Christian life. Many spiritual experiences need to be hidden away and should not be exposed.</p><p>The Lord Jesus sometimes gave His testimony, but He was never talkative. It is one thing to give a testimony and another thing to be talkative. The Lord healed the sick and insisted that the story of the healing be kept secret. This charge is repeated again and again in the Gospel of Mark. Once the Lord told a certain person, "Go to your house, to your own people, and report to them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how He has had mercy on you" (5:19). We may speak of the great things the Lord has done for us, but we must not publish these things abroad as items of news; this only exposes ourselves as being without any root. To be without root is to be without any treasure; it is to be without any hidden life or hidden experiences. It is essential that some of our experiences remain covered; to uncover everything is to lose everything.</p><p>Let us also remember that if we display all our treasure, captivity cannot be averted. Death and exposure go together, and spiritual dryness and exposure also go together. Even if we have to give a testimony, we must be like Paul, who boasted out of necessity "though indeed not expedient" (2 Cor. 12:1). Satan's attack often comes at the time a man is exposed. Any kind of exposure opens us up to loss. Many people are healed of their sickness, and they testify for the glory of God. But many testimonies of healing are not for the glory of God but for the glory of one's own faith. As a result, the sickness comes back. After these ones give their testimony once, they are attacked by the same thing again. This shows us that God covers those who cover their roots, and God does not protect those who disclose their roots; they will be exposed to attacks. If God wants us to testify, we still have to do it. But there are many things that ought to be hidden away. God protects what we hide before Him, and we enjoy it.</p><p>The same applies to our work. By His grace and mercy God has accomplished something through us, but remember that what He has accomplished is not a matter for advertisement or material for propaganda. If we expose the work of God, we will find that the touch of death comes upon it immediately; and the loss will correspond to the extent to which we expose ourselves. As soon as David numbered the children of Israel, death set in (2 Sam. 24). May God deliver us from this kind of exposure.</p><p>Whatever secrets we have with the Lord must be preserved. We can only move according to God's instruction within us. Only if He moves within us to reveal something, dare we reveal it. If He wants us to share some experience with a brother, we dare not withhold it, for that would be violating a law of the members of the Body of Christ. One law of the members of the Body of Christ is fellowship. Once we suppress this law, the flow stops. We must be positive, not negative, and minister life to others. But if we are engrossed all day with ourselves and with our own things, this talkativeness and exposure opens us to assault from the enemy. I trust we shall learn what the Body of Christ is and what the flow of life among the members is; but I trust we shall also learn the need for safeguarding the hidden part we have before the Lord, the experiences which are not known to others. No root should be exposed.</p><p>As we extend ourselves deeper and take root downward, we will discover that "deep calls unto deep." When we can bring forth riches from the depths of our inner life, we will find that other lives will be deeply affected. The minute our inner being is touched, others will receive help and be enlightened. They will know that there is something beyond their knowledge. When deep touches deep, deep will respond to deep. If our life has no depth, our superficial work will only affect other lives superficially. We repeat yet again&mdash;only "deep calls unto deep."</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">TWO KINDS OF OFFERINGS</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 3:7, 21; 2:15; 4:1-8; Rom. 8:6-8; Phil. 3:3-4</h1><p>Genesis 2&mdash;4 are very familiar to us. We often preach the gospel from them. But what God says to His children in these chapters is actually more than what He says to the unbelievers. Through these few chapters of the Bible, God shows us the way He has established for us to walk in.</p><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>After Adam sinned, he immediately employed a way and a method to save himself: He used fig leaves to sew himself an apron. The fig leaves were grown from the ground, and they were the result of Adam and Eve's dressing and keeping of the garden of Eden. In other words, they tried to use what they produced themselves to cover their shame. Man realized before God that he had fallen and sinned, so he quickly devised ways to remedy the situation. The first act of man after his fall was to improve his behavior.</p><p>When we first believed in the Lord, we did not realize the depth and extent of man's works. We thought they just stemmed from man's wish to do good to save himself. Actually, man's work implies that, after his fall, he wanted to satisfy God with the best that he could produce with his own effort. He realized that he was naked, that he was shameful, and that he was not acceptable before God. Hence, he devised a way to cover himself. He wanted to do good to satisfy God's heart.</p><p>While man was struggling with his own ways, God gave him a revelation by making coats of skin to cloth them. This signified that not only did the redemption of man require blood and the death of another but also that man's own works could not cover his shame before God or satisfy God's heart. Since man has sinned, there is only one way of obtaining salvation, and that is through the cross and through death.</p><p>Coats of skin signify not only the death of the Savior but also the death of the sinner. Second Corinthians 5:14 clearly says, "One died for all, therefore all died." It does not say that since one died for all, then all do not need to die. It says, "One died for all, therefore all died." In making coats of skin for Adam and Eve, God was pronouncing death upon them. At the time of the Passover, the blood of the Lamb was put on the two doorposts and on the lintel of the houses. God said, "When I see the blood, I will pass over you" (Exo. 12:13). By clothing Adam and Eve with coats of skin, God showed that salvation not only requires the forgiveness of sins through the death of the Savior, but also the death of the sinner.</p><p>Salvation involves not only resolving the problem of our sin but also the termination of us as a person. God dealt not only with sin but also with our person. Adam and Eve ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; this was sin. They sewed aprons of fig trees; this was their good work. We must realize that God rejected not only the eating of the fruit but the sewing of the aprons as well. If a man sins, he displeases God. If he performs good works by his own effort, he also displeases God. Man's need consists not only of blood but also of death.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>If we understand Genesis 3, we can readily understand chapter four. After Adam sinned, he sewed aprons with the result of his labor&mdash;the fig leaves&mdash;to cover himself. Cain, the son of Adam, followed the same principle. He offered the produce from the land, the results of his own cultivation, unto God. Cain did exactly the same thing as Adam. The only difference was that Adam's work was for himself, while Cain's work was offered to God. Adam wanted to cover himself with his works in the hope of making himself a good man, whereas Cain offered God the produce from the land in the hope of pleasing God. In principle, their works were the same.</p><p>While this was occurring in Genesis 3, God clothed Adam and Eve with coats of skin, signifying that the cross must be upon them and that death must work upon them. This was God's revelation to Adam. In Genesis 4, Abel took God's way. Abel offered unto God the firstling of his flock and of their fat. What was so special about Abel was that he understood the need of the cross. He realized that man had sinned and had to die and that without his death man could not please God.</p><p>What were the results of the offerings of Cain and Abel? The Bible tells us that "the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering: but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect" (vv. 4-5). God accepted Abel and his offering, but not Cain and his offering because Abel pleased God in accordance with the way of salvation established by God, while Cain tried to please Him through his own flesh.</p><p>Cain's offering implied that even though man had sinned and was fallen, he did not need to die; rather, he could work on his own and use the labor of his work to please God. Man thinks that the leaves he cultivates can cover his shame and produce from the land can be offered to God to please Him. Cain relied upon his works to come before God; he had not passed through death. He thought he could please God by his own effort. But God did not look upon it and would not accept it.</p><p>Abel's offering seemed to say, "O my God, the skin You have ordained enabled me to be a proper man. I now offer You the fat under the skin to please You. The skin is for me and the fat is for You." Both the skin and the fat are the results of death. Only through death could Abel obtain skin to clothe himself, and only through death could he obtain the fat to offer to God.</p><h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>Romans 8:7 says, "Because the mind set on the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, for neither can it be." The man who minds the flesh is the natural man, the original man, the man who is according to his natural birth. This man is not subject to the law of God, neither can he be. Yet the Word of God tells us not only that the fleshly man sins but also that the fleshly man attempts to do good, because verse 8 says, "And those who are in the flesh cannot please God." This obviously indicates that the man of flesh attempts to please God. No matter how hard he may try, in the end he still cannot please God. Regardless of how man serves God through his flesh, the result is always the same&mdash;he cannot please God. His offering, like that of Cain, can never be accepted by God. Only one offering is acceptable to God: our cross and our death. This is like the fat&mdash;a sweet-smelling offering before God.</p><p>Therefore, our greatest service to God is not how much we can do for Him or how much we can accomplish for Him but how much we can die. But this is not acceptable to many self-righteous men. Man often measures everything by his own work, thinking that if he can have fruit, if he can help others repent and believe in the Lord, he can bring all these offerings to God. But we should know one thing: We cannot serve God according to our work. Man's greatest offering to God is to be on the altar, which is death. Was there ever an offering accepted by God which did not pass through the altar? Was there ever an offering that passed through the altar and still lived? All offerings to God must go through death.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, perhaps your emphasis is revival, the repentance of many, and many great works. We acknowledge these as being important, yet they are not the primary need; they are secondary needs. The first thing we should do is confess before God: "Lord, I know I am useless, I am weak, and I am unclean. I know I am full of the work of the flesh. Therefore, Lord, I only look to You. I want to please You; I am willing to lay myself on Your altar as a burnt offering."</p><p>As an offering, Cain brought success and fruit, instead of the knowledge of the cross. Cain was successful, and he bore fruit. Yet death is the only condition that enables God to accept man's offering, and Cain's offering lacked death. God's Word says that a man of flesh cannot please God. You may try, but it will be in vain. Cain could offer his offering, but it was not acceptable to God. The pursuit of God's pleasure to many is just an activity of the flesh; there is no mark of the cross or any sign of death in it. However, there are some brothers and sisters who truly know the cross. When you touch them, you discover that they are broken and bruised and have the wound of the cross; we can sense the presence of subjective experience and the result of blows upon them. God desires this kind of person; He desires this kind of mark in a man. Therefore, work, zeal, or the fruit of work is not acceptable to God. Everything must come from the Holy Spirit. God cannot accept the fruit of man's labor for Him; He only accepts the fruit from man's reliance upon Him. We can only prostrate ourselves before Him and say, "I am only a channel, Lord. I pray that You pass through me." If we do this, we will see blessing, and we will see God's acceptance.</p><p>Paul said, "For we are the circumcision, the ones who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh" (Phil. 3:3). At that time there were people who worshipped God in the confidence of the flesh. It is possible for man to worship God in the flesh, as Cain did; however, God cannot accept man's worship in the flesh. God can only accept man's worship in the spirit.</p><p>Our mistake is to infer God's acceptance of a thing by its merit or demerit. But God does not ask whether a thing is good or bad. He asks whether it comes from Him. The goal of many children of God is for Him, but their strength is from themselves. They have a heavenly purpose, but they employ earthly strength to achieve it. The purpose of Cain's offering was not improper, because he wanted to please God just as Abel did. The difference between Cain and Abel was in what they offered. It would be a gross error for us to presume that as long as our purpose is to serve God, to please Him, to do His work, and to bring about spiritual revival among His children, we can employ whatever means there are. We may not say it this way, but this is a fact. If we serve God with our own strength, it is the flesh. The flesh is man's own strength, the strength he has originally. If we serve God with this strength, it is the same as Cain's offering.</p><p>Do not think that Abel had a loftier goal than Cain. Both of them had the same goal, that is, to make an offering. Abel was accepted not because he had a loftier goal than Cain but because what he offered was better. Abel's offering signifies the fact that man has no place before God, that man can do nothing, that man must die and not live, that man should tremble before God, and that man should have no confidence before Him. Abel's offering seemed to say to God, "God, I know that whatever comes from me is not acceptable. I cannot serve You. I can only trust in Your life and Your Spirit. I can only depend on the law of the Spirit of life." Abel's offering was made under these circumstances, and this became a sweet-smelling offering to God.</p><p>Therefore, brothers, in serving God it is not how much you have done for God. Your work may not be for the service of God, and the service of God may not need your kind of work. In serving God, the most necessary thing is the cross. The crux of the matter is this: "We are...the ones who serve by the Spirit of God...and have no confidence in the flesh" (Phil. 3:3). These are Paul's words. You may have heard this many times, but, brothers, what is your standing today? Where do you stand? What kind of an offering are you making? I am not asking whether you have offered something up. I am asking what you have offered. An offering acceptable to God must go through death. Anything that has not gone through death cannot be counted as an offering. An offering that has not gone through death can never be acceptable to God.</p><h2 class="head1">FOUR</h2><p>However, this does not mean that we only have to adopt an attitude of looking to God, believing in God, and waiting and trusting in God, when we come before Him. Our attitude alone cannot replace God's work. Perhaps after some brothers and sisters hear a message on the cross, they change their attitude. They may say, "In the future I have to learn to be more humble and gentle before God. In the future when I work, I have to learn to rely on Him more." Even this does not mean they have the sign of death. We need to realize that the cross is God's work upon us. One day the Lord will enlighten us in His mercy, and through this enlightening, we will be crushed and an eternal mark will be left upon us. From that day on, we may still move, but every time we move, we will feel the pain and the absence of strength. A day will come when the cross does its work on us, and we will no longer please God according to our flesh.</p><p>Therefore, it is useless to have a mere change in our attitude; what is needed is the true experience of the cross. A person may try to change his attitude, but it will not last long, and he will soon forget the change. When something happens he will become bold in himself again. When others say a few words of praise to him, his face will shine again. When his work is making good progress, he will feel as if he is treading on the clouds again. Have you seen this? What is the use of having just a change in attitude? It is useless to have the attitude of the cross without the experience of the cross. There must first be the experience of the cross before there can be the attitude of the cross. Paul said, "And I was...in weakness and in fear and in much trembling" (1 Cor. 2:3). He was a person who knew the cross, so he could have the attitude of the cross. If we pretend to be in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling, this will go away in a few days and be forgotten even by ourselves. It is easy for us to have the right attitude and the right message, without the experience of the cross. When this happens, we will easily forget about the whole matter after some time. Once a brother said, "I used to preach the cross, but for some unknown reason I have not touched this subject for the last ten months." Is this surprising? No. If it is only a subject, it will soon be forgotten. If God has done a work on me and touched me, I will spontaneously become a weak person. I will not have to try to be a weak person; I will be weak. I will not have to imitate Paul and be in fear and trembling; I will be in fear and trembling. There will be a sign of the cross on me, and I will be changed into another person. This is having an offering before God, and this is pleasing to God.</p><p>This was the experience of Jacob at Peniel. He limped because his thigh was crippled, and he remained this way for the rest of his life. Yet many Christians do not suffer a wound after falling. They fall repeatedly, but after getting up they can still run. Before they fall they are one kind of person, and after they rise up they are still the same kind of person. But when the cross does its work on such a person, he will fall and not be able to get up again. When he finally gets up, no matter how hard he tries, he will not act the same way as before; there will be an indelible mark on him. From that point on, even if he wants to be great, he will be unable to try. A Christian who is truly touched by God finds no heart for his own idea; he cannot be proud even if he tries. God has done a work in him, and he makes his offering through this work. This is the meaning of death, and this is the meaning of the cross.</p><p>In conclusion, we must repeat that the cross is not a mere doctrine or teaching; it is God's enlightenment. Once God enlightens us, we can no longer live as we did before. This is the cross. Men like Peter, John, and Paul in the New Testament and Job, Jacob, Daniel, Isaiah, and Ezekiel in the Old Testament all experienced a one-time intense enlightening from God. After they saw the light, they could no longer live as they did before, and their lives could never be the same. This is the cross. When God's light exposes the self, we will no longer live the same way. This is the cross. We will realize that nothing from ourselves pleases God and that we can only prostrate ourselves before Him. This is the cross. Then we will serve God according to this cross, not serving by the flesh and not trusting in our own works; we will serve by the Holy Spirit and trust in God's life. May the Lord deliver us from mere doctrines, and may the cross truly work on us so that we may make an offering which is acceptable to Him and become a person who is acceptable to Him.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1><h1 class="title">IDLE WORDS LEAKING LIFE</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Prov. 13:3; 15:4; Matt. 12:34, 36-37</h1><p>If a water container has a hole, the water inside will leak away. It is not a question of whether or not there is water in the container but whether there are holes. Some brothers and sisters greatly desire to know about the cross and, at times, are very willing to bear the cross. Such ones should be full of life. Yet it is strange that even though they are so seeking, desirous, and willing to bear the cross, they do not touch any life in them. Instead, they touch death, because all the life that they have gained has leaked away.</p><p>Proverbs 13:3 says, "He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life:/but he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction."</p><p>We are not sure whether Solomon was referring to physical life or spiritual life when he wrote this proverb. But let us consider spiritual things based on this principle. A seeker of the Lord, who has life and wishes to supply the church with life, must be careful with his words. If we are not careful with our words, life will leak away. Why are some people not very useful in the hand of the Lord? They are not useful because life has leaked away. One only touches death in them; one does not touch any life in them because the life has leaked away through their words. Therefore, we have to guard our mouth, even keeping a close watch on it. Many stories testify that nothing leaks away life as much as idle words. This does not mean that sin is better than idle words. However, it does mean that next to sin the most debilitating thing for our life is our idle words.</p><p>Matthew 12:36 says, "And I say to you that every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment."</p><p>Does it say "every filthy word"? No. Does it say "every blasphemous word"? No. Does it say "every evil word"? No. It says "every idle word." Idle words are redundant words, incongruous words, unnecessary words, and gossiping words. "Every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment. For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned." This is what the Lord Jesus said. We have to realize that not only are blasphemous words serious but loose words are also serious. It is a serious thing to speak idle words as well as filthy words. We have to realize that we can make recompense for certain sins, but we cannot make recompense for other things and sins. If we offend anyone through idle words, there is no way to make a recompense for this. We can confess to others, and we can retract our words, but the sound has reached others' ears, and we cannot take it back. It is possible to make a recompense if we have stolen from others. But it is impossible to make a recompense if we have offended others with idle words. This sin will have to go before the Lord. Therefore, the Lord said, "Every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment. For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned."</p><p>Proverbs 15:4 says, "A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: /but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit."</p><p>To be wholesome is to be temperate, mild, and moderate. When a man speaks too much, his tongue becomes hot, and when his tongue is hot, the tree of life is gone. A wholesome tongue is a tree of life. A wholesome tongue is a tongue that is not quick, foolish, or excessive. Such a tongue is like a tree of life. One cannot smell the flavor of Christ in a Christian who loves idle words. Those who love idle words cannot supply life to others. Idle words are a big hole which leak away one's life.</p><p>Idle words leak away life. What then should we do? In order to keep our mouth, we must first deal with our heart. The Lord says, "For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks" (Matt. 12:34). When the heart has something, the mouth speaks it out. If we have something in our heart, sooner or later, it will come out of our mouth. If we do not speak it here, we will speak it elsewhere. If we do not speak it in this house, we will speak it in another house. Whatever is in the heart, the mouth will speak out. Therefore, in order to learn before the Lord to stop our idle words, we must start by dealing with our heart. If we do not deal with our heart, our mouth can never be dealt with properly. It is the heart that is first filled with all kinds of things before the mouth speaks of them. Never think that a word can be said in a heartless way. The Lord's Word shows us that there is not such a thing. As long as there is a word, there is a heart for it. Because there is a heart for something, the mouth speaks. Hence, in order to deal with idle words, we must first deal with the heart.</p><p>Paul exhorted the Corinthian brothers who were in trouble to "all speak the same thing." How can this be? He continued by saying, "That you be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion" (1 Cor. 1:10). The life of the church is like the life of an individual. The life of an individual can leak away through idle words. The life of the church can also leak away through idle words. Because we have the same life, we should be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion. Once we are attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion, we can speak the same thing, and we will not have idle words. Therefore, to deal with idle words, we must first deal with the heart.</p><p>James 3:11 says, "Does the spring, out of the same opening, gush forth the sweet and the bitter?" If a spring cannot gush forth two kinds of water, a mouth cannot speak two kinds of words. A spring can only gush forth one kind of water. In the same way a mouth can only speak one kind of word. We must deal with idle words before the Lord in a definite way. If this leakage is not stopped, undesirable things will keep pouring in, and things that should not leak away will continue to leak away. The loss will be immeasurable. We have to stop this leakage at any cost. We need to ask the Lord, saying, "Lord, deal with my mouth so that I can be preserved by Your grace."</p><p>You must deal not only with your own mouth but also with others' mouths. You have to help those who love idle words, gossip, and idle reports. Some people like to come to you with idle words. You should not allow them to start. You can say to them, "Brother, let us pray." You should not allow them to speak idle words. You should lead them to pray or recite Scripture verses. You should lead them to the proper path. You can even be more blunt by saying, "Brother, we have to learn to speak words that edify others. It is better that we do not speak any idle words."</p><p>If we want to be one who stops the leakage, we must first ask God to deliver us from our curiosity. We should learn to fear God. Many Christians are curious; they like to hear novel things and even filthy things. Their ears are like a garbage can which takes in all kinds of things. If we are delivered from this, we will save ourselves from many sins and help many brothers and sisters from many sins. If our ears are not itching and if we do not afford others the opportunity to speak idle words, we will preserve our mouth from leaking life and help others to stop their leakage.</p><p>May the Lord deliver us from idle words that leak life. Other than sin, idle words leak life the most. If we are preserved in our words, we will be able to preserve life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1><h1 class="title">A POOR MAN</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 3:17</h1><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>Among God's children, there is a problem of a Laodicean attitude and a Laodicean heart. A man who thinks that he is rich but, in reality, is poor has a Laodicean attitude and a Laodicean heart.</p><p>In spiritual matters, the matter of having or not having is easy to resolve, but the matter of being poor or being rich is not as easy to resolve. Those who have nothing can easily see God, but those who have a little do not easily see God. Many people have nothing before God, and they often meet God. The worst kind of people are those who have a little; they understand a little of this and a little of that. But do they really know? Do they really understand? No. They speak a great deal, but they have not moved a single inch or advanced a single step. They are poor ones indeed.</p><p>The biggest problem with poverty is that a man will not easily admit that he is poor. Those who have nothing readily admit that they have nothing. If they have something, they say so, and if they do not have something, they also say so. This is very simple and clear. But poverty is something relative. If Mr. A is worse off than Mr. B, it means that Mr. A is poorer than Mr. B. But Mr. B can be worse off than Mr. C, which means that Mr. B is poorer than Mr. C. It is easy to make a judgment when one has nothing. It is not so easy to make a judgment when one is poor.</p><p>The first time a child has some money, he thinks that he is the richest man in the world. He does not know his poverty. If he does not have any money, he easily understands that he has nothing. But if he has a little money, it is more difficult to show him that he does not have enough money for certain things. In spiritual matters, God can deal with those who have nothing. Those who are poor, however, are hindered by the little that they possess. They think that they have something, and they become proud and self-sufficient.</p><p>Someone may have obeyed God only three times during the past ten years, but he never forgets that he has obeyed God. While he is talking about obedience, others who have truly learned the lesson and who are sensitive almost have to stand up and shout to him: "Do you really know what obedience is?" Those who talk about obedience in this way are poor men, truly poor men.</p><p>Many people constantly talk about the cross. One may say that what we need before the Lord is the cross. Another may say the same thing, but those who truly know the cross almost have to say: "Brothers, do you know what the cross is?" Just because God has dealt with you a few times does not mean that you have been thoroughly dealt with before the Lord. God dealt with you on the day that you were saved, but this does not mean that you have learned a deep lesson. You are still very short! Those who do not know the cross, yet who talk glibly about it, are indeed poor!</p><p>Some brothers say that they are clear that the church is this and that; they say that they did this and that when they saw the Body of Christ. Some sisters say that they are pursuing after the kingdom; they say that they are willing to forsake everything for the kingdom. But those who know them will say that they do not know what the Body or the kingdom is. Many of the things that God's children have are very cheap. They have cheap obedience, cheap crosses, a cheap Body, a cheap kingdom! Actually, they do not know obedience, the cross, the Body, or the kingdom. They are poor men!</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>Poverty is not a hindrance if it does not come with pride. But nothing can be done about poverty when it is in a proud person. Poverty is not the problem. Being like Laodicea is a problem because Laodicea was poor and proud yet thought that she was rich. In the spiritual realm, it is hard to find a person who is poor but not proud. On the contrary, it is often the rich ones who are not proud. It is a pity that many of God's children go around in circles and never advance. The sole reason that they suffer loss is because they think that they have something. Many people talk about the flesh, but actually they do not know what the flesh is. Many people talk about revelation, but they do not know what revelation is. They can say much about obedience. They can say much about the kingdom. They can say much about the cross, dealing with the self, or dealing with the natural life. Yet what they say and how they speak reveal that they are poor and ignorant. They have never touched God. They speak what they do not know and only deceive themselves and those who are like them. In spiritual matters, those who think that they are rich can never make others believe that they are rich. On the contrary, they only expose their poverty.</p><p>The church in Laodicea said, "I am wealthy and have become rich and have need of nothing" (Rev. 3:17a). This does not refer to material riches, but to spiritual riches. She felt that she had something. But God said, "You...do not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked" (v. 17b). Did she have something? Yes, but what she had was of no benefit to her. If she really had something, she should have rejoiced, yet she was wretched and miserable. She did not behave as if she had anything. Her wretchedness and misery tell others that she was poor.</p><p>Poverty is always linked to blindness. Those who are spiritually poor are always blind. The blind ones always think that they are rich. Those who have not seen the cross think that they know the cross. Those who have not seen the kingdom think that they know the kingdom. Those who have not seen the Body of Christ think that they know the church. All those who think that they have something are poor. Whenever we truly see something, we will not dare to boast that we are rich. Whenever our eyes are opened, we will see that we are naked. Only the foolish ones boast of what they have. A Laodicean is poor, but does not see his own poverty. This is a warning to us.</p><h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>What is poverty? Poverty is not just a question of quantity but also a question of quality. First Corinthians 3 shows us the distinction between gold, silver, and precious stones, and the wood, grass, and stubble. Second Timothy 2 shows us the distinction between the vessels of honor and the vessels of dishonor. Such distinctions separate the poor ones from the rich ones. Even when we have something, we still have to ask what it is that we have. If all we have is a pile of wood, grass, and stubble, we are still poor. It is not enough for us to be a vessel; we still have to ask whether we are a wooden and earthen vessel or a gold and silver vessel. It is easy to be proud when we think that we have something. As long as we have something, we think that we are marvelous. Little do we know the kind of material that we have. This is poverty.</p><p>Poverty also means superficiality, childishness, and immaturity. A rich life is a mature life. We have to realize that there is a difference between growth and maturity. A child grows year by year, but after he becomes an adult, the important matter is no longer growth; rather, it is maturity. If one has only a period of growth, his life is not yet rich enough. There must be a period of maturity before there can be riches. Those who take the initial period as the whole period are those who think that they have something; they are Laodiceans, and they are poor ones. Therefore, initial experiences always spoil us from having further experiences, shallow experiences hinder us from having deep experiences, and shallow knowledge hinders us from acquiring deep knowledge.</p><h2 class="head1">FOUR</h2><p>Being rich is not merely a question of having something. It is a question of how much one has, what he has, and to what degree he has it. It is not the initial experiences. It is not a mere understanding of doctrine or something that one claims with his mouth. When God opens the eyes of a person, he begins to enter the land of spiritual riches.</p><p>One brother spent a great deal of time to study the Bible during the first year after his salvation. He concentrated on one subject: the Lord's second coming. He did a clear analysis of the things concerning the Lord's second coming, and he felt quite proud of himself. One day he met a sister who was deep in the Lord. When she talked to him about the Lord's second coming, she did not analyze; her attention was on how one should prepare himself for His coming. On that day, he learned a lesson. While he was talking about the Lord's coming, here was a person who was waiting for the Lord's coming. The one who only talked about the Lord's coming was poor, while the sister who waited for the Lord's coming was rich.</p><p>All those who have truly seen something before the Lord are not presumptuous and do not think that they have something. For example, it may take a person one, two, ten, or even twenty times of revelation before he can really see the truth in Romans 6. The first time he sees the truth in Romans 6, he may feel that nothing more can top this experience. He may say that he has seen it. But the second time he sees it, he will say, "I did not see this before." This means that when the light comes, it will tear down what one originally had. There is a brother who knows the truth about the church very well. Once a few people gathered together and had some light concerning the church. This brother said, "How interesting! I never knew what the church was. But thank the Lord that I see it today." Others may think that if he did not know the church, then no one else would have known anything about the church. But the minute he saw the light, he realized that he had nothing. The shining of the light is also the swallowing of the light; the greater light swallows up the lesser light. All light disappears under greater light. Every time a person truly sees something before the Lord, he will feel that he has never seen anything. This does not mean that he has actually seen nothing; he may have seen something. But after he receives the greater light, he will not think much of what he saw before. On the contrary, he will realize that he had nothing.</p><p>Riches come from enlightenment. When the light shines, we become rich. However, when we are enlightened, we do not have a feeling of increase but one of stripping. Once the light comes, all the former things are shattered, and what we originally had is torn down. It is true that when we are under the light, we have some increase before God. But on our side, we do not feel anything. What goes on before the Lord is one thing, and what goes on in our feeling is another thing. God may give us something once, twice, or three times. If we feel that we have increased, it proves that we have not seen anything. If we truly see something, we will feel as if we are newly saved and just starting out on our journey. It does not mean that we were not saved before this time; it means that in our feeling, we feel as if we were not saved. We feel empty and feel as if we never had a beginning. Hence, those who are rich feel that they have nothing under the light.</p><p>Our God is a rich God. He does not wish to see His children being in poverty. His works are not works of wood, grass, and stubble. The vessels He uses are not vessels of dishonor. He is a rich God, and His vessels are rich vessels. God's riches are deep and profound; they are such that "there is no room for it" (Mal. 3:10). His grace is always such that there is not room enough to receive it! His works in us are always such that there is not room enough to receive them. God does not work in a stingy way. He is not weak or miserly. This rich God can make us rich people. He is always giving us more and more. Every time He gives us something, we feel as if we are receiving it for the first time. This may sound strange, yet this is a fact. May the Lord be merciful to us, so that we truly see something before Him and so that we truly have the light. The proud ones are the foolish ones, and they are always poor ones. May the Lord empty us so that we can enter into His riches.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE PRINCIPLE OF PRAYING THREE TIMES</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 26:44; 2 Cor. 12:8</h1><p>A key to prayer is to pray "three times" to the Lord. "Three" does not refer literally to the number three; it merely signifies multiplicity. The Lord Jesus prayed to God three times in Gethsemane, and when God answered His prayer, He stopped praying. Paul also prayed three times to the Lord, and when he received an answer from the Lord, he stopped praying. Hence, all prayers have to take care of the principle of praying three times. This does not mean that we should pray once, twice, and three times and then stop. It means that we have to pray until we are through and until God has answered us.</p><p>The principle of praying three times is an important principle. Not only must we pay attention to the principle of praying three times in our personal prayer, but we must also take care of the same principle in the prayer meeting. If we expect our prayer to fulfill the ministry of church prayer and accomplish what God wants us to accomplish, we must keep this principle in mind.</p><p>The principle of praying three times means that we have to pray in a thorough way. We have to pray until we get through, until we are clear about God's will, and until we receive an answer from the Lord. In the prayer meeting we must never think that just because a matter has been brought up and a brother has prayed about it we do not need to pray about it more. Suppose a sister is sick, and we pray for her. After one brother has prayed, it does not mean that I do not have to pray more. No, after that brother has prayed, I can still pray, and another person can still pray. This does not mean that every matter must be covered by three prayers. It means that whoever has the burden should pray. Sometimes we need to pray five or ten times. The important thing is to pray until the burden is released. This is the principle of praying three times. This is the key to success in our prayer meeting.</p><p>Our prayer should not be like grasshoppers, jumping from one place to another. We should not jump to a second thing before the first thing is thoroughly prayed over and then jump back to the first thing before the second thing is thoroughly prayed over. This kind of skipping prayer will not release the burden or receive answers from God. Such prayers are useless and do not fulfill the ministry of prayer.</p><p>In order to fulfill the ministry of prayer, we must have a burden to pray before the Lord. We are not setting up a law; we are merely laying down a principle. We have to know that burden is the key to prayer. If a man does not feel any burden to pray for a certain thing, he will not succeed in his prayer. In the prayer meeting, many brothers and sisters mention many things in prayer. But if you are not touched by those things, you cannot pray for them. Every brother and sister must come to the prayer meeting with a burden for prayer before they can pray. At the same time, we should not merely pay attention to our burden but to the burden of the other brothers and sisters as well. Suppose a sister has a husband who is giving her a difficult time, while another brother has incurred a sickness. In the prayer meeting, one brother may pray for the salvation of the sister's husband. After this, another brother may pray for God to heal the sick brother. Then a third brother may remember another matter. These prayers are isolated prayers; they are not according to the principle of praying three times. There has not been a thorough prayer in one matter before going on to another matter. In the prayer meeting, we have to watch to see whether the burden for prayer has been released. If the prayer burden for that sister has been released, we can go on to pray for the sick brother. But if the first prayer burden has not been released, we should not jump to the second or the third thing and pray for those matters. If the burden of the whole meeting is not released concerning a certain matter, we should not insert another prayer according to our personal feelings. We have to sense the spirit of the whole meeting and enter into the feeling of the whole meeting. Some matters are answered after one prayer. Some matters are answered after two prayers. Some matters require three or five prayers before the burden can be released. No matter how many prayers there are, the burden must be released before the prayers can stop. The principle of praying three times is to pray until the burden is released.</p><p>We have to note the difference between personal prayers and prayers in the prayer meeting. When we are praying by ourselves, we only have to take care of our personal burden. But in the prayer meeting, we have to take care of the burden of the meeting, and we must not care for our personal burden alone. Therefore, in the prayer meeting, we have to learn to sense the feeling of the meeting. Some matters only require one prayer; there is no need to pray anymore for them because the meeting has no more burden for it. But some matters require more than one prayer; they need to be prayed about over and over again. If a burden is not released, we should not pray for another matter. We can only change the subject when the burden is released. Only then can we pick up another burden from the Lord to pray. In the prayer meeting, we have to learn that when one prays for a matter, the second, third, fourth, and fifth person should also pray for the same matter. Even if one person can pray by himself or five persons can pray by themselves, when they come together, they may not be able to pray in one accord. The prayer of one accord is something that one learns. One person may know how to pray by himself, and five persons may know how to pray by themselves. But when they come together, they still need to learn a new kind of prayer; they need to learn to pray in one accord. Our prayer in the meeting is something that is learned; it is not something that we know how to do right from the beginning.</p><p>If two persons pray in one accord, God will answer this prayer (Matt. 18:19). This is not a small thing. We have to enter into others' feelings and know what the prayer of the church is. We have to learn to feel whether or not a prayer burden has been released. If we do this, we will know how to fulfill the ministry of prayer in the meeting.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1><h1 class="title">THE GUIDANCE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT<br />IN THE CHURCH MEETINGS</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 14:26-33</h1><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>Ephesians 2:22 shows us that the church is being built together to be a dwelling place of God in spirit. The whole church gathering together is the dwelling place of God. One characteristic of God's dwelling place is the presence of His light. We know that in the temple in ancient times, there was sunlight for the outer court and light from the lampstands for the Holy Place. However, in the Holy of Holies, God manifested His own glory and radiance, and He Himself was the light. When we become God's dwelling place, there must be light among us because God manifests His glory through His dwelling place. If we meet in a proper way, we can look to God to shine forth His light among us, and we can look to Him to speak to us.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>First Corinthians 14 teaches us how we should meet. Verse 26 says, "What then, brothers? Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up." This means that when we meet, some will have a hymn, some will have a teaching, some will have a revelation, some will speak in tongues, and some will have interpretation of tongues. Everyone builds up the church with what they have. Therefore, before the Lord, we must have a very careful understanding of the meaning of the guidance of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit will not guide those who do not have anything to say. He will not guide those who have a hymn to teach or those with revelations to interpret the tongues. The Holy Spirit does not do foolish things. Only foolish people do foolish things. The question of supply at the meeting is not settled at the time of the meeting but in our own house. What we have at home will be what we have at the meeting. What we do not have at home we will not have at the meeting. The "has" in this verse is not the result of personal preference, personal thought, or sudden emotional impulse. What a person receives as he exercises daily before God is what he "has"; they are the things that are constituted in the spirit. This spiritual accumulation is what we have, and it is what we can use to supply the need of the church in accordance with the guidance of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>Hence, those who have a hymn should supply the church with a hymn. Those who have a revelation should supply the church with a revelation. Those with a teaching should supply the church with a teaching. Every one supplies the need in the church with what he has, not with what he does not have. Whatever you have is what you can minister to the church. For instance, you may have a hymn that you want to sing; it keeps coming to you, and you cannot help it. This means there is music in your heart; there is a hymn in your heart. This is your hymn. You do not come to the meeting and look for a hymn. Rather, through the guidance of the Holy Spirit, you supply the hymn you "have" for the edification of the church. There may be a few words which have become very precious to you during the past few days. These are your words. Similarly, you may have a revelation or a teaching; you just supply the church with what you have.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, what has the Lord done or said to you these days?</p><h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>First Corinthians 14:26 tells us that the Holy Spirit guides us by means of what we have, while verses 27 to 33 tell us that the guidance of the Holy Spirit is also in accord with the circumstances. For instance, the evening meeting in the church ends at nine o'clock. The Holy Spirit will not guide you to stand up and give a long talk when it is nearly nine; He will make you realize that time is running out and that you should not call a long hymn or talk too much. While you supply the church with what you have, you must also learn the lesson that "the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets." If you have something, you can bring it to the meeting, but you must consider what others have. In the meeting there may be more than twenty brothers and each one may have a hymn; you also have a hymn. When you realize that two or three have called their hymns, you no longer need to call yours. There is no need for each of the twenty or more brothers to call a hymn; if this happens, the singing will go on until midnight. This is contrary to the guidance of the Holy Spirit. The Lord wants us to do all things becomingly and in order (1 Cor. 14:40). What we have qualifies us to supply others, while the circumstances teach us to be guided by the Spirit. In our meetings we should observe the principle of "two or three" (1 Cor. 14:29). The Spirit will not guide us to supply what we do not have, nor will He contradict the principle of "two or three." If we have something before the Lord, we can be guided to stand up and speak. However, if other brothers have received the same thing, we should hold our peace.</p><h2 class="head1">FOUR</h2><p>There are two difficulties in the church. First, those who do not "have" think that they "have." In many instances, a child of God is not the kind of person he wants to be, yet he insists on speaking as if he were such a one. In reality, God has never said anything to him or worked in him. He has nothing within him, yet he likes to talk, and he likes to express himself. When this happens, the church is not built up. Second, some people are unwilling to follow the guidance of the Holy Spirit. The Lord may have spoken to a brother or a sister, yet he or she waits and holds back from speaking. In this way the church is deprived of the supply it deserves. If you find that you are empty inside, you should keep silent. If you know that you "have" something, you should supply the church. The Holy Spirit dispenses life to the meeting through what you have, making it possible for God's children to touch life. God may put a word within you; the same word may be in you while you are at work and while you are walking on the street. You realize that God has spoken to you. You should realize that this word is not for you alone but also for the church. When you "have" something, you should supply the church with what you have.</p><p>At the time the tabernacle was built in the Old Testament times, the people dedicated their gold and silver to God. The same is true with us today. We should give what we have. Some have a revelation, some have a teaching, and some have a hymn. Let everyone bring what he has. At the time of the building of the tabernacle, the Spirit of God gave wisdom and understanding to men to make fitting utensils out of the gold and the silver and a tabernacle from all kinds of materials. The materials themselves were offered up by the Israelites, while the completion of the tabernacle was brought about through the arrangement of the Holy Spirit. Today we bring in the materials, and the Holy Spirit arranges them. In this way, the church is built up.</p><h2 class="head1">FIVE</h2><p>In our daily walk, we should have constant communion with God and look to Him for His work in us, so that we will "have" something and be able to supply the church with what we have. We should remember that God guides us in the meeting according to what we already have&mdash;a hymn or a revelation. We must first have something that we can share with others. Since we have learned and accumulated something during our daily walk, we can be guided in the meetings and render a supply to others. What we give to the church should not be something that we come up with on the spur of the moment or something that is according to our own good idea but something we have in our daily life, that is, something God has given us during our daily life. During this time, God brings us forward in a certain way, and He makes us a certain kind of person. As a result, you supply others with what you have. Ideas do not count; doctrines are of no avail; what is of value is what we really have. If we supply the church with what we have, the church will be built up, and the brothers and sisters will receive help. If everyone supplies the church with what they have, the result will be living and rich.</p><p>Under normal circumstances in the church, the Holy Spirit will not guide a person to give what he does not have. God used an ass only to deal with Balaam (Num. 22). If we really live a life that befits the children of God, our meeting will become God's sanctuary. Let us pray that we may "have" and that we may use what we "have" to supply the church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">HEART AND LIGHT</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 5:8; 6:21-23; 2 Cor. 3:16; Psa. 73:1, 13, 16-17, 25</h1><p>These passages all speak of the heart and light. Let us consider the relationship between the heart and light.</p><p>Matthew 5:8 says, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God." Seeing is related to light. If you can see, there must be light. Without light, it is impossible to see. This verse also says, "They shall see God." God is light. Therefore, to see God is to see light. The condition for seeing light is having a pure heart; those who are pure in heart can see light.</p><p>Matthew 6:21-23 says, "For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is single, your whole body will be full of light; but if your eye is evil, your whole body will be dark. If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!" This verse again mentions the relationship between the heart and light. Whenever your heart follows earthly treasure, your eye cannot be single; you are in darkness and cannot see light.</p><p>Second Corinthians 3:16 says, "But whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away." What is a veil? A veil blocks a person from seeing. Any time your heart turns to the Lord and is proper, the veil in you will be removed and there will be light.</p><p>Psalm 73:1 declares, "Surely God is good to Israel,/To those who are pure in heart." This is the subject. Then the psalmist said that for a time his eyes were on the prosperity and success of the wicked, and he almost slipped. Yet he did not fall because his heart was still somewhat pure. He did not understand until he entered into the sanctuary of God. He said that before he saw the light he was like a beast, irrational and ignorant. But when he entered into the sanctuary of God, he saw; then he said, "Whom do I have in heaven but You?/And besides You there is nothing I desire on earth" (v. 25). This is the experience of one who sees light after being in extreme darkness. He had not fallen into total darkness because his heart was still somewhat pure. Hence, there was still an opportunity for him to receive God's grace and to receive light.</p><p>These four passages show us that when the heart is pure, one sees God; when the heart is single, there is light within; when the heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away; and when the heart is pure, one does not slip and can know God further. Since there is such a close relationship between the heart and light, it is necessary to deal with our heart in order see light.</p><p>What is meant by the "heart"? What does it refer to? This is not easy to explain. According to the Scriptures, man is divided into three parts. Outwardly there is his body, and inwardly there is his spirit; between the body and the spirit there is the soul. Is the heart in the spirit or in the soul? It is difficult to say; however, we can say that man's heart includes his conscience (Heb. 10:22; 1 John 3:20-21), his mind (John 12:40; Luke 2:35), his emotion (John 14:1; Luke 24:32), and his will (Acts 11:23). Our mind denotes the part with which we think, our emotions denote the part with which we feel, and our will denotes the part with which we make resolutions. The heart is linked to the spirit and also to the soul. We may say that the heart includes the mind, but the heart is not just the mind; the heart includes the emotions, but the heart is not just the emotions; the heart also includes the will, but the heart is not just the will. The heart is something in between the spirit and the soul. The heart occupies an important place in man. The issues of life stem from our heart, and the condition of our heart determines the issues of life (Prov. 4:23).</p><p>What is light? First John 1:5 says, "God is light." Only God is light. It is impossible for us to encounter light without encountering God. God is the Father of lights (James 1:17). God is the source of light. Therefore, when we say that we see the light, it means that we see God; we have met Him inwardly. Because we see God, we have light.</p><p>What kind of heart enables a person to see God? Those who are pure in heart shall see God. What does pure in heart mean? A pure heart desires only God and it is focused on God. It is a heart that is for nothing else in this universe except God. Only those who have such a pure heart can see God and can see light.</p><p>Dear brothers and sisters, have we not seen other saints stumble? Why have they stumbled? The Scriptures give us a principle: Those who stumble must be in darkness. Some may stumble in the daytime, but it is because they do not see the thing that stumbles them. This is the same as those who walk in darkness. Any kind of stumbling proves that a man is in darkness. Brothers and sisters, regardless of how sound your excuses may be, if you stumble, you are in darkness. First John 2:10-11 says, "He who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no cause of stumbling in him; but he who hates his brother is in the darkness." If a man is in the light, he will not stumble. If he stumbles, he is clearly in darkness and not in the light. Is it possible for a man whose heart is only for God and for nothing else to be stumbled? If your heart is for God and nothing else, nothing can stumble you. Even if you are misunderstood, despised, and opposed by everyone, you will still not be stumbled. This is because your heart is not after man's understanding, esteem, sympathy, or praise; your heart is only after God. If you are after man's understanding and esteem, you will surely stumble when others misunderstand or despise you. But if your heart is only after God, you would not be stumbled even if your circumstances were ten times worse. There is only one kind of person who stumbles&mdash;one whose heart is not inclined toward God but rather is seeking and longing for something apart from God. This kind of person lives in darkness. God is like the sun, and we are like mirrors. In order for a mirror to reflect the light of the sun, it must face the sun. Whenever the mirror is misaligned a little, it will lose light. Similarly, whenever our heart is not properly focused, our words will not be properly focused; we will immediately have complaining words, ill-humored words, criticizing words, and gossiping words. This is a very strong proof that we are in the dark and not in the light. Those who are in the light do not stumble. Some brothers and sisters can praise with tears in their eyes. Although their hearts are sorrowful, they can still praise God. They can do this because their hearts are inclined toward God. They live in the light, and nothing can stumble them.</p><p>For instance, if your heart is for God and not for your clothes, you will not become angry or complain when your clothes are spoiled or torn. If your heart is not for God but rather for your clothes, the minute your clothes are damaged, your heart will be provoked, and you will lose your temper and complain. This shows that you are in darkness. Only when your heart is toward God will you not be taken away by your clothes. Only then will you have the light, and only then will you see something.</p><p>Suppose your heart is on your children, and you love them more than God. When you do this you are in darkness. This does not mean that parents should not love their children. It means that if the parents' hearts are captured by their children, if they indulge in their love for them and have more regard for them than they have for God, they will not have any light. Some brothers and sisters are very clear concerning other things, but they are blind with love for their children. For them, it is reasonable even if their children behave unreasonably. These brothers and sisters are in darkness. Their hearts must turn to God before they can be free from the bondage of their children and before they can have light and see.</p><p>With some brothers and sisters, their hearts are covetous for money. They are surely in darkness because the Lord clearly says that "where your treasure is, there will your heart be also." When money is in front of their eyes, they will not see God or any light, and they will definitely be in darkness. But if they free their heart from money, they will receive light.</p><p>Whenever you are about to engage in a dispute with another person, you should first check to see whether you are dealing with this person directly or whether you have first turned to God. Then you can deal with this person while keeping your heart on God. Only when your heart is aimed at God will it be enlightened; only then will it see accurately. Otherwise, you will speak foolishly and debate foolishly. You will insist that the other party is wrong and that you are right. If your heart is focused on God, many disputes will not become an issue at all.</p><p>This is not all. Those who are learning to serve the Lord should be alerted to another thing: not only can man, things, and matters become the source of our darkness, but even our service to the Lord or our gifts and talents from God can become the source of our darkness. Regardless of how useful God makes us and how much gift and power He gives us, these things can easily cut off our relationship with God. If our heart is attached to our work or our gift, the most dangerous time is when our work prospers, because we can fall into darkness easily. This is because none of these things is light; only God is light. There is no light besides God. If we put our heart in anything apart from God, whether it is good or bad, it will prevent us from seeing God. Our heart must not be held by our work; it must not be held by our gift or by the result of our work. Our heart should be toward God. Only then can we have light, and only then will we see.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, our heart must be proper and pure, and it must be toward God. If our heart is not toward God, we will surely be in darkness. It is most pitiful to be in such a condition. When our heart is focused on God, we will see light. Once we have light, all the improper things will spontaneously fall away from us. When the heart is proper, there will be light. Once the light comes, it will deliver us from errors. The more light there is, the more deliverance we will have. If we are free from errors, it proves that we are persons in the light. Therefore, in order to have light, we must first deal with our heart.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE OPENING OF GOD'S WORD<br />GIVES LIGHT</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 4:12; Psa. 119:130</h1><p>Many Christians have an unusual number of problems. If these were merely outward problems, they would not be that important. But many of these problems point to inward darkness and to the lack of spiritual clarity; one should not treat this lightly. Some situations are necessary for a Christian in the course of spiritual progress. However, a Christian should not allow himself to remain indefinitely in darkness and unclearness. It is not God's will that we should constantly have problems; God does not wish to see us remain in darkness. How then can we become clear spiritually? Let us see what the Word of God tells us.</p><p>Hebrews 4:12 says, "For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart." This tells us that when the word of God enters, we will be able to distinguish between what is from the spirit and what is from the soul. We cannot discern the difference by merely asking ourselves inwardly; this will only result in confusion. The more we look inwardly and the more we search ourselves, the more problems will arise and the greater the darkness will become. One question will give rise to ten questions, and ten questions to a hundred questions; the questions will go on. On the other hand, if the word of God enters into us, there will be no need to ask questions; the questions will be gone, and we will become clear. In fact, we will become very clear indeed. For instance, you may meet a man on the street and speak something to him. Although the words may be correct, you feel very uncomfortable afterward. The words were proper and your intention was good, but inwardly you feel otherwise. An hour later you come across a brother and speak to him at length, and the words are helpful to him. This time you feel inwardly satisfied; you feel that a burden has been released and you have rendered a service to God. There is little difference in the words spoken on these two occasions, but there is a great difference in your inward feeling. This difference is very clear to you; it tells you that one is wrong and the other is right. The outward distinction between the two is negligible. Superficially, it seems that the words spoken on both occasions were identical, but inwardly, you perceive a difference. When the word of God is in us, we shall know from within what is from the spirit and what is from the soul. Once we have this inward knowledge, there will be no more questions.</p><p>Psalm 119:130 says, "The opening of Your words gives light, /Imparting understanding to the simple." When the word of God enters into you it gives light; you will become inwardly clear, and you will have assurance. The word of God is not just the written Scripture which you read. It is also necessary for the Spirit of God to make this word living in you. Only the living word is useful, and this word will divide your spirit from your soul. This is not a question of reading a book and finding what way is spiritual and what way is soulish. Even if you follow the way given in the book, the result will still be soulish. But when the word of God enters into you and shines in you, it will separate the soul from the spirit; it will even expose the joints and marrow. You will know what is wrong and what is right. This is an inward knowledge. Such a person will no longer need to ask questions because there is light within him, and he sees from within.</p><p>Some people ask themselves all the time: "Am I living for God or for myself? Is this the will of God or my own?" Indeed, it is extremely difficult for us to distinguish which ideas and opinions are our own because we are very often deceived by our own thoughts and intentions. Nevertheless, as soon as the word of the Lord enters, it sifts through the thoughts and intentions of our hearts and immediately shows us which thoughts are perverse, which thoughts are impractical, which thoughts are selfish, which thoughts come from fear, and which thoughts protect ourselves. Inwardly we will see and become very clear. Self-analysis will not give us light; it will only lead us into self-deception. The more we analyze ourselves, the more we will be deceived and the more the word of God will be hindered from entering into us. When the word of God enters into us, our eyes will be opened, and we will no longer need to ask any questions because we will be able to discern the thoughts and intentions of our heart. Brothers and sisters, whenever we have a problem within, we ought to look to the enlightening of God's word. In this way, we will not be deceived.</p><p>Many of God's children discern right from wrong according to the conscience. However, we should know that the human conscience is still something very shallow. Life is something much deeper than the conscience. Some things often pass the test of the conscience but may not necessarily pass the test of life. Occasionally we do things by way of "trial and error." If our conscience is clear after we have done something, we thank God for it, and if our conscience is guilty, we ask God for forgiveness. We have to wait until the thing is done before we know whether we are right or wrong. But we should realize that we have a life within us. When the word of God enters into us that life will give light, and we will be inwardly clear even before we do anything. The word of God in us gives light and enables us to discern what is from the spirit and what is from the soul. It follows spontaneously that when we touch the spirit, we will realize it is the spirit; and when we touch the soul, we will realize it is the soul. We will know as soon as we touch it; it will become very clear to us.</p><p>The word of God will shine within us and make us clear. It is living and operative. It is not something outward but something inward. We do not discern the spirit from the soul according to outward things; this discernment is the result of inward clearness. Then and only then can we practically know God and recognize the way we should take.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE BASIS OF<br />FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD AND<br />OF RECEIVING LIGHT FROM HIM&mdash;<br />THE MERCY SEAT AND THE CHERUBIM</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 25:10-22</h1><p>Exodus 25:22 says, "And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel." Here two things are clearly mentioned: fellowship and the receiving of light. "There I will meet with thee." This is fellowship. "I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel." This is the receiving of light.</p><p>The one thing that occupied God's mind the most in the Old Testament was His tabernacle, which later became the temple. God has a great expectation, a great goal, which is to dwell with His people. God's desire is to tabernacle among men. The greatest item in God's eternal plan is God dwelling among men. God desires to have a meeting place between Himself and man. Therefore, when the Lord Jesus became flesh, He tabernacled among us, full of grace and truth. His purpose was to dwell among us (John 1:14). The word Emmanuel shows that God dwells among men. But the Lord Jesus was only one man. This could not satisfy God's heart. He desires to build us up through His own Spirit to be the dwelling place of God in spirit (Eph. 2:22).</p><p>The center of the tabernacle and the temple was the ark. Whenever the ark left the tabernacle, the tabernacle was rejected. Whenever the ark was captured and taken away from the temple, the temple could no longer be God's dwelling place. God dwelt with man upon the ark, and man fellowshipped with God through the ark. We will not cover everything about the ark, because that is too great a subject. We will only concentrate on the mercy seat upon the ark and the two cherubim wrought of gold which were upon the mercy seat. God intended to speak and to commune with Moses from the midst of the two cherubim on the mercy seat. We need to realize that God fellowships with man from the midst of the two cherubim on the mercy seat; He speaks to man and man receives light from Him from the midst of the two cherubim on the mercy seat.</p><h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP</h2><p>The mercy seat is the place where God bestows His grace. On the day of propitiation, the tenth day of the seventh month, the blood of the sin offering was brought to the mercy seat (Lev. 16:14-15). The mercy seat is the place for the propitiation of sins. God's grace comes to man only after the propitiation of sin. If man is not propitiated for, he can never receive mercy from God. On the golden mercy seat, there must be the sprinkling of the blood of the sin offering before God can bestow grace to man. There is a human thought that since God has the authority to bestow grace, he can bestow grace any time He wants and grant mercy any time He wants. God does have the goal of bestowing grace. This is the reason He set up the mercy seat. But we must realize that without the day of propitiation every year, in which the high priest sprinkled the blood on the mercy seat, God could not forgive anyone's sin.</p><p>On the two ends of the mercy seat were the cherubim, and God's glory was on the cherubim (Ezek. 9:3; Heb. 9:5). One touches God's mercy on the mercy seat, and one touches God's glory in the midst of the cherubim. God must bestow His grace in such a way that it matches His glory. God cannot have the mercy seat without the cherubim; He cannot bestow grace from the mercy seat without passing through the cherubim. God can be gracious to us, and He desires to deal with us in grace. However, He cannot deal with us through the mercy seat alone; He must also deal with us through the cherubim. We have all sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. Man can no longer come up to the standard of God's glory. If God dealt with us according to His glory, none of us would be eligible to receive His grace. We would only be qualified to be cursed; we could not receive mercy. Therefore, the blood of propitiation must be the sprinkling of the blood of propitiation upon the mercy seat before God can deal with us in glory and upon the mercy seat.</p><p>This shows us that our fellowship with God is based on our compatibility with His glory; it is based on our matching the glory of God. This compatibility comes from the blood. Because of the blood, God is able to bestow grace without sacrificing His glory. God's children need to remember that those who come to God must not fall short of His glory. If you come to God and what you bring in falls short of God's glory, you will not be able to fellowship with Him, and you will not be able to stand up before Him. Since the basis of fellowship is the glory of God, if anyone has a problem with God, it means that he has fallen short of the glory of God. Many brothers and sisters often say that the basis of fellowship is the blood. But we have to remember that the blood is the basis of fellowship because the basis of fellowship is God's glory. Without God's glory, there would be no need for the blood. We need the blood when we fellowship with God because He is a God of glory.</p><p>Romans 3 says that man has fallen short of the glory of God because of his sins (v. 23). At the same time, it says that the blood of Jesus justifies us (vv. 25-26). God is a God of glory. Therefore, all those who come to God must remember that their fellowship with God depends on their relationship with God's glory. Anything that does not give glory to God is a sin, and anything that falls short of God's glory is also sin. Sin takes away our fellowship with God. We do not have to sin consciously to lose our fellowship with God, and we do not have to commit gross sins before our fellowship with God is cut off. As long as we do not actively glorify God in a matter, our fellowship with God is damaged. We must remember that the basis of our fellowship with God is His glory. We must also note that man's fellowship with God is based on glory and also on the blood. God's glory demands that there be the blood. If we had not fallen short of God's glory, we would not need the blood. The reason we need the blood is because we have fallen short of God's glory. Glory is the basis of fellowship, and the blood is there to make up our lack.</p><p>We must realize that fellowship is frustrated when there is sin. But sin is still the negative reason; it has not touched the crux of the issue. The crux of the issue is the glory of God. Whenever we fall short of God's glory, and whenever we cannot attain to God's glory, fellowship is frustrated. Thank the Lord that there is the blood of the cross upon God's mercy seat today. Through the blood, we can look up to God's glory and live in His glory. Thank the Lord that His propitiation has put us in a position where we can behold God's glory with unveiled face. This is the meaning of fellowship. Fellowship is not spending half an hour to an hour studying the Bible or praying. Fellowship is beholding God's glory through the blood and having a life that is totally for His glory.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RECEIVING OF THE LIGHT</h2><p>Second, we have God's speaking, His shining, or His revelation. God spoke to Moses from the midst of the two cherubim. In the matter of fellowship, God stressed the fact that fellowship and communion with Moses was based on the mercy seat. However, He has no intention that we forget the cherubim; He has no intention that we forget His glory. In His shining, God spoke with Moses from the midst of the two cherubim. His emphasis is on His glory. If man can fellowship with Him upon the mercy seat, he is able to hear God's word from the midst of the cherubim. Of course, God has no intention that we forget the mercy seat either.</p><p>God spoke to Moses from the midst of the two cherubim; He led His children according to His glory. Wherever God's glory resides, there is His leading also. God's leading came in the form of the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night. Through the pillar of cloud, man sees God's glory, and through the pillar of fire, man also sees God's glory. The place of God's glory is the place of His leading.</p><p>God speaks and leads according to His glory. When God speaks to us personally concerning a certain matter, that is the time we know that we are glorifying Him. If we see God's glory in a certain matter, we know that we have His leading in that matter. With many of God's children, leading and glory are two different things. But before God, glorifying God and being led by God are not two things but one. Wherever we find God's glory, we find His leading concerning certain matters for us. As soon as we see God's glory, we know that we are in the right place.</p><p>God spoke from the midst of the two cherubim. All those who have seen God's glory have heard His speaking. We do not have to see His glory first and then wait for His speaking. Once we see God's glory in the way of life, this seeing will give us a more profound knowledge than we previously had. Whenever we see God's glory, we understand and know.</p><p>What is right? What is wrong? What is the right way? What is the wrong way? What has spiritual value, and what does not have spiritual value? It all depends on whether or not God's glory is there. Some matters may be small and may not be worth much in man's eyes, but the minute you touch it, you know that you have touched God's glory. Once you touch God's glory, you know that you have the leading, and there is no need to wait for more leading. With some work, the more you engage yourself in it, the more you feel that it is cheap and wrong. With some other work, the more you engage yourself in it, the more shining you become, and the more light there is. You feel that such work is worthwhile and right. It is not a question of a great or a small work but a question of whether or not God's glory is there. If God's glory is not there, it is worthless; if God's glory is there, it is worthwhile.</p><p>When Moses preached God's word, he became a minister of the word in the eyes of the Lord. He ministered to God's people with God's word. All the words which God spoke to Moses and which He commanded Moses to convey to the Israelites were given to him from the midst of the two cherubim. Hence, when Moses spoke for God, he touched the glory of God. In the same way, if we touch the glory of God and see His glory, we will have something to say. Sometimes we feel very good about what we have said, and the arguments seem sound. Yet we feel that it is very superficial and shallow. There is no testimony of the word in our speaking, and there is no ministry of the word. If a matter is of God, we will immediately sense that it comes from the midst of the two cherubim and will know that the glory of God is there. God's glory is not only something objective but something among us and something we can know.</p><p>Many times in our daily life, we touch the glory of God, and we find that there is something that glorifies God. Such a glory becomes our leading. In our work we often touch the glory of God; we find glory in our work. At these times we can say that the glory brings us the leading. If we touch the glory of God while we are ministering a word to the church, we know that we have ministered God's word. Every time we receive a revelation from God, we touch the glory of God. When God speaks from the midst of the two cherubim, we do not merely have words, but we have glory as well. Whenever we have only words without glory, we know that we only have doctrine. Whenever there are words as well as glory, we know that we have revelation. It is strange that every time we see God's glory, our mouth may not be able to articulate it, but we know it deep within us. If anyone asks us how we see, we may not be able to tell him, but the result of the seeing is there. The greatest manifestation of glory is for us to prostrate ourselves on the ground. When we prostrate ourselves on the ground, we do not know what has happened, yet we know that we have touched God.</p><p>The basis of our fellowship with God and of receiving light from Him is this touch of God's glory. If we do not have this basis, everything we have is just doctrine and theory. May the Lord be gracious to us, so that day by day as we live on earth, we may touch God's glory.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE LIFE OF THE ALTAR AND THE TENT</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 12:7-8; 13:3, 4, 18</h1><p>The life of a Christian is the life of the altar and the tent. The altar is toward God while the tent is toward the world. In His presence, God requires that His children have an altar and on the earth that they have a tent. An altar calls for a tent, and a tent in turn demands an altar. It is impossible to have an altar without a tent, and it is also impossible to have a tent without a return to the altar. The altar and the tent are interrelated; they cannot be separated.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LIFE OF THE ALTAR</h2><p>Genesis 12:7 says, "The Lord appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the Lord, who appeared unto him." In this verse we see that the altar is based on God's appearance. Where there is no divine appearance, there is no altar. No one can offer himself to God unless he has first met God. Unless God has appeared to a man, he cannot offer his all to God. Consecration is not the result of man's exhortation or persuasion but of God's revelation. No one can voluntarily offer up all he has on the altar if God has not first appeared to him. By nature, no one can offer himself to God. Even when a man does want to offer himself to God, he finds that he really has nothing to offer. Some have said, "I want to give my heart to the Lord, but my heart will not agree." Man cannot come over to God's side. However, when man meets God, consecration takes place spontaneously in his life. If you catch sight of God just once and touch God just once, you are no longer your own. God is Someone who cannot be touched lightly! Once a man touches God, he can no longer live for himself.</p><p>We need to realize that the power to offer oneself to God comes through His appearance; it comes from His revelation. Those who talk about consecration are not necessarily consecrated themselves. Not everyone who preaches consecration or understands the doctrine of consecration is a consecrated person. Only those who have seen God are consecrated persons. God appeared to Abraham, and the immediate issue was that Abraham built an altar to God. The Lord Jesus appeared to Paul on the road to Damascus, and Paul immediately asked, "What shall I do, Lord?" (Acts 22:10). A turning point in our spiritual life does not come through our decision to do something for God; it does not come as a result of our resolving to do this or that for God. It comes when we see Him. When we meet God, a radical change takes place in our life. We can no longer do what we did in the past. When we meet God Himself, we have the power to deny ourselves. The matter of denying one's self ceases to be optional when we have met God. His appearance makes a person unable to go on by himself; it forces him to not live by himself anymore. God's appearance brings with it inexhaustible power. Such an appearance will alter the whole course of a person's life. For a Christian, the power to live for God is based on his vision of God. Oh! It is not our decision to serve the Lord that enables us to serve Him. It is not our will to build an altar that produces an altar. An altar is built when God comes to a man.</p><p>Thank the Lord that He does not have to say anything when He appears. Yet many times, He chooses to say something when He appears. When God appeared to Abraham, He said to him, "Unto thy seed have I given this land" (Gen. 15:18). God's appearance brings us into a new inheritance. It brings the realization that the Holy Spirit has been given to us as an earnest of the inheritance which we shall later possess in fullness. The part that we have received today in the Holy Spirit will be ours in full in the future. When God's plan is fulfilled, we will enter the full inheritance.</p><p>God appeared to Abraham, and Abraham built an altar. This altar was not for a sin offering but for a burnt offering. A sin offering is for redemption, while a burnt offering is an offering of ourselves to God. The altar here does not refer to the Lord Jesus' vicarious death for us; it refers to the consecration of ourselves to God. It was the kind of altar spoken of in Romans 12:1: "I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service." The mercy of God caused the Lord Jesus to die for us. The mercy of God provided the cross on which we died with Him and on which the devil was dealt with. By the mercy of God we have His life within, and by His mercy, He will bring us into glory. It is on the ground of His mercies that God beseeches us to offer ourselves as a living sacrifice to Him.</p><p>In connection with the burnt offering, we should note that a person of ample resources may have offered a bullock, one with less resources may have offered a sheep, and one whose means were even more limited may have offered a turtledove or pigeon (Lev. 1:3, 10, 14). But whether one offered a bullock, a sheep, or a turtledove or pigeon, the offerer had to offer up the whole. One could not offer half a bullock or half a sheep. God wants everything whole; He does not want a half offering. He cannot accept anything less than utter consecration.</p><p>For what purpose was the burnt offering placed on the altar? It was to be wholly burned. Many of us think that we offer ourselves to God to do this or that for Him, whereas what He wants of us is a burning. He does not need a bullock to plow the field for Him; He wants the bullock to be burned on the altar. God is not after our work, but ourselves. He wants us to offer ourselves to Him and be burned for Him. The altar does not signify doing something for God but living for God. The altar does not mean having busy activities but having a living for God. No activity or work can replace the altar. The altar is a life that is totally for God. Unlike the sacrifice of the Old Testament, which was utterly burned in one act, the sacrifice of the New Testament, as depicted in Romans 12, is the presenting of our bodies as a living sacrifice. Daily we are consumed on the altar, yet daily we are living; we are ever living, yet ever consumed. This is the sacrifice of the New Testament.</p><p>God appeared to Abraham, and Abraham offered himself to God. Once a man sees God, he will offer himself up totally to God. It is impossible for a man to see God and yet be indifferent. The altar is present as soon as a person sees God. Once there is the taste of His grace, the result is the altar. Once a man sees God's mercy, he becomes a living sacrifice. When the Lord's light comes, he will say, "What shall I do, Lord?"</p><p>Abraham had not heard many doctrines about consecration, nor had he been urged by others to consecrate himself. But Abraham had seen God, and when he did, he immediately built an altar to God. Oh, brothers and sisters, consecration is a spontaneous thing. Anyone to whom God has manifested Himself cannot do anything other than live for Him. Once God appears to a person, he will live totally for God. So it was with Abraham, and so it has been with everyone who has met God throughout the two thousand years of church history.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LIFE OF THE TENT</h2><p>The altar has its issue in the tent. Genesis 12:8 says, "And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent." From then on, Abraham lived in God's house&mdash;Bethel. From then on, he lived in a tent. Actually he lived in a tent before, but God did not mention it. Not until he had built the altar does the Word of God bring the tent into view.</p><p>What is a tent? A tent is something movable; it does not take root anywhere. Through the altar God deals with us; through the tent God deals with our possessions. At the altar Abraham offered up his all to God. Was he thereafter stripped of everything, even his clothing and belongings? No! Abraham still possessed cattle and sheep and many other things, but he had become a tent dweller. What was not consumed on the altar could only be kept in the tent. Here we see a principle. Everything we have should be placed on the altar. But there is still something left. These are the things that are for our own use. However, they are not ours, they are to be left in the tent. We have to remember that anything that has not passed the altar cannot even be in the tent. But not everything that has passed the altar is consumed. Many things are burned away by the fire and are gone. When we consecrate many things to God, He takes them and nothing is left behind. But God leaves some of the things offered on the altar for our own use. The things that have passed through the altar and are for our use can only be kept in the tent.</p><p>Abraham's life was a life of the altar. A day came when even his only begotten son was offered upon it. But what did God do with Isaac? He did not take him away. What you place on the altar, God accepts. He cannot allow you to live for yourself, for your own pleasure, or by your own strength. The altar claims your all, yet not everything that is on the altar is burned. Many things that are placed on the altar are like Isaac; God gives them back to you. Yet these things in your hand can no longer be regarded as your own; they can only be kept in the tent.</p><p>Some people ask, "If I give my all to God, do I have to sell all my possessions and dispose of all my money? If I consecrate myself to God, how many chairs and tables may I have in my home and how many garments in my wardrobe?" Some people are truly perplexed over such questions. But we need to remember that we have two lives. We have a life to live before God, and we also have a life to live in the world. In our life before God everything must truly be on the altar, but for our life in the world we still have need of many material things. While we are living in the world, we need clothing, food, and a dwelling place. We ought to consecrate our all to God and live for Him alone; but if He says we may retain a certain thing, then we may retain it. Nevertheless, we must apply the principle of the tent to all the physical things that He permits us to retain, because they have been given back to us to meet our need in the world. If we do not need them, we should dispose of them. We may use them, but we must not be touched by them. We can have them or let them go; they can be given, and they can be taken away. This is the life of the tent.</p><p>May we learn this lesson. We dare not use anything that has not been placed on the altar, we may not take anything back from the altar, and what God gives back must be kept according to the principle of the tent.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SECOND ALTAR</h2><p>Genesis 12:8 says, "And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the Lord." This is Abraham's second altar. The altar led to the tent, and then the tent led again to the altar. With the altar, nothing is ours any longer, and whatever is left from the altar is placed in the tent. Nothing can occupy our heart anymore; our conscience is at peace before God, and we can boldly say to Him, "I have not held back one thing from You." In this way, the tent leads us back to the altar. If our possessions have taken root and we cannot drop them or move them anymore, we become bound by these things, and there can never be a second altar.</p><p>When we offer ourselves upon the altar and consecrate our all to God, He leaves certain things for our use; but we have no choice as to what we can keep in the tent and what we have to take out of the tent back to the altar. Everything must first pass the altar. Whatever God leaves for our use, we can put in the tent. But we must still inquire of God concerning all the objects in the tent; we can only keep those that God allows us to keep. We cannot decide to keep anything for ourselves. Everything has to pass the altar first; we must first check with God about every one of them before we can put them into the tent. What has been placed in the tent may go to the altar again at any time. If at any time God says, "You do not need this thing," we should relinquish it immediately. If we cling to it and say, "This is mine," then in our heart we have forsaken the altar and are no longer consecrated. We cannot return to the second altar and say to God that our life is being lived for Him.</p><p>God demands that everything we have be placed on the altar and that we have placed what He has left for us in the tent. We can only have the second altar when everything is in the tent. The most precious experience is the experience of the second altar. It is easy for us to be stirred up, to become zealous, and to consecrate ourselves. But three or five years after this, we collect many things from the world again, and we cannot go back to the altar anymore. But it is very precious if we can always be tent dwellers and build a second altar. The problem is not with possessions. The problem is with how our consecration stands.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF THE ALTAR AND THE TENT</h2><p>Abraham had his failures. In his history there was a forsaking of the altar and the tent; he went down to Egypt. But there was recovery. How did that recovery come about? Genesis 13:3-4 says, "He went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai; unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the Lord." Recovery is a matter of returning to the altar and the tent. Have any of you failed? Have any of you slipped or betrayed your cause? Have any of you gone down into Egypt, so that now you have your own demands, your own hopes, your own interests, and your own aspirations? If you are seeking the way of recovery, you have to come back to the altar and the tent. God's Word shows us that Abraham's recovery involved his return "unto the place where his tent had been...unto the place of the altar, which he had made." Recovery is to return to the tent and to the altar.</p><p>What happened to Abraham after his recovery? Genesis 13:18 says, "Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the Lord." Hebron is the place of fellowship with God; it is the place of eternal and continuous fellowship. Abraham dwelt in Hebron, and in Hebron he built another altar for God. If we want to be in fellowship with God, we can never forsake the altar. May He be gracious to us and cause us to see the importance of consecration so that we may live a life of the altar and the tent!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE CROSS AND<br />THE WINE MINGLED WITH GALL</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 27:34; Luke 23:33-34</h1><p>When the Lord Jesus was led by man to Golgotha where he was about to be crucified, "They gave Him wine to drink, mingled with gall. And when He tasted it, He would not drink" (Matt. 27:34). At that time the punishment of the cross was the most agonizing kind of punishment; therefore, the law in those days permitted giving the one who was going to be crucified wine mingled with gall to drink. Although wine mingled with gall was not as good as the anesthetics that surgeons use today, at that time it was the substance that best alleviated the pain in one's senses.</p><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>The Lord Jesus was very distinctive here in that He would not drink wine mingled with gall. When others were crucified, they all wanted to drink wine mingled with gall; only the Lord Jesus would not drink it when He was crucified. There was bitter feeling with the crosses of men, so they all needed wine mingled with gall to remove the pain in their senses. But in the cross of the Lord Jesus, wine mingled with gall was refused. If one is crucified and also drinks wine mingled with gall, then it will be a cross of man and not the cross of our Lord. In the cross of our Lord, there is not such a thing as wine mingled with gall; there was no need for it. Man sent wine mingled with gall to His lips. After tasting it, He also knew that it was wine mingled with gall and that it could alleviate His pain, but He would not drink it.</p><p>At this point we should ask the reason for the Lord's refusal. The cross produced a bitter feeling in others, but it did not produce such a feeling in the Lord Jesus. (This does not refer to physical feeling; physically, He also had feeling.) Because others were full of feelings, there was a need for wine mingled with gall. But here was a person who, on the spiritual side, did not harbor any bitter feelings when He was crucified, so He did not need wine mingled with gall.</p><p>According to Luke, when the Lord was on the cross, He prayed, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing" (23:34). This is what is meant by having no need of wine mingled with gall. Here was a man who was wrongfully accused, afflicted, scourged, shamed, persecuted, rejected, judged, and even condemned by men. He was abused by men to the uttermost, but at this point He lifted up His head and said, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." He had no feeling of bitterness within, nor the feeling of being wrongfully accused, nor the feeling of being persecuted; therefore, He needed no wine mingled with gall. A person who has no feeling of bitterness within does not need wine mingled with gall to alleviate his pain.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>Those who harbor a feeling of bitterness, who need wine mingled with gall, are those who will not bear the cross. Many children of God apparently seem to be bearing the cross but are not doing so in reality. Bearing the cross requires no consolation and joy outside of God. But when many bear the cross, the ones living next door know all about it. If those upstairs bear the cross, the ones living downstairs know about it. When it comes to many people, their countenance, expression, and voice tell people: "Look! I am here bearing the cross." We should realize that if the news of the existence of a cross leaks out, it is not a cross. Whenever the news leaks out, there is no cross. The news that leaks out is wine mingled with gall. Human beings are prone to seek comfort, love, and sympathy from others upon suffering even a little pain. We do not know how innumerable are those who thirst for these things, but this is not the cross. A great problem among God's children is that God is not their joy. Therefore, they seek joy outside of God. God cannot satisfy their heart, and therefore, they need to seek comfort outside of God. This is wine mingled with gall. This is not something that belongs to the cross.</p><p>When God's children suffer, there are perhaps three different kinds of feelings. Some react outwardly toward men; some turn inward; and some suppress their feelings. Those who react toward men become angry with others, hate others, and do not forgive them. Those who turn their feelings inward become hurt and pity themselves, supposing that they are following the Lord and that they are suffering very much like the Lord. Those who suppress their feelings become passive. We easily become angry; we easily pity ourselves; and we easily become passive. Some of God's children think that being passive is being victorious. Little do they know that the passive ones, in their feelings, also expect wine mingled with gall. Passivity is another expression of being hurt. Because one is despairing within, he becomes passive; because he expects too much, he becomes passive. Passivity proves that there is no cross; it is only the forcible suppression of one's feelings.</p><p>Among God's children, some do suffer, but there are not many who really bear the cross. When they are suffering, they express themselves in a few different ways. Someone may think that since he is a Christian, he is supposed to suffer. Outwardly he says nothing, and he really looks like a cross-bearing Christian, but secretly he is murmuring. Such persons, who murmur a great deal after they have suffered, still do not know what the cross is because inwardly they are filled with bitter feelings; they need wine mingled with gall.</p><p>Some people do not murmur when they suffer. There is neither spoken nor silent murmuring. Yet they weep. We must realize that the cross is a place where the blood is shed and the body is sacrificed; the cross is not the place of weeping and self-pity. Those who pity themselves and weep are those who do not know the cross. Weeping means that one is not willing to see himself suffer. Only those at the foot of the cross weep; those who are on the cross have no tears. If a person feels hurt after enduring a little pain or suffers after incuring a little loss, he still does not know what the cross is.</p><p>There is also another kind of person who is puffed up with pride and pretends to be an overcomer. This person is not a crucified person either because his kind of reaction is for gaining people's attention. He seems to be saying, "Though I suffer, I can still sing hymns and still give praise; I am a cross-bearer." The purpose of his behavior is to gain man's admiration. This is also wine mingled with gall; this is not bearing the cross either.</p><p>Some do not bear the cross in reality but are very capable of talking about the cross. They consider that this encounter is an experience of the cross, and that incidence is also an experience of the cross. This happening is a cross, and that happening is also a cross. What these persons expect is the pity of men. Their heart is grieved only because no one pities them. Their eyes are always looking around them for some to come and pity them. These persons crave wine mingled with gall; they are not crucified.</p><h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>Then what is the cross?</p><p>The cross is not turning one's feelings toward others; it is not turning one's feelings inward or suppressing one's feelings. The cross is a matter of joyful acceptance; it is for a person to thank God saying, "The path that God has chosen for me is all good. I can be glad, I can give thanks, and I have no problems because I receive from God's hand the cross that He has given me."</p><p>The cross forgives; it does not pity itself, and it is not passive. The only feeling the cross gives us is a feeling of thanksgiving to the Lord.</p><p>The cross is a matter of having a soft heart before God. Whatever God wishes, let it be so. It is a matter of knowing that God is great and that God is also love.</p><p>The real bearing of the cross will only result in others' respect; it will not seek man's pity. Whenever one seeks man's pity and whenever one seeks man's comfort, that is only wine mingled with gall and not the cross. Our Lord was crucified on the cross, and therefore the cross becomes a place where we worship the Lord. The Lord's cross was at Golgotha, and therefore Golgotha becomes the center of our praises to the Lord. If a brother is suffering for the Lord on the cross, we will kiss his hands and his feet for the Lord. But he is not a cross-bearer if he expects this and that while enduring the pain of the cross.</p><p>Our Lord refused wine mingled with gall for the simple reason that He did not need man's help. He did not need man's help because He already had God's joy in Him. The cross means rejoicing within and being able to praise God within. Therefore, a cross-bearer can comfort others. Paul said, "Who comforts us in all our affliction that we may be able to comfort those who are in every affliction through the comforting with which we ourselves are comforted by God" (2 Cor. 1:4). A person such as Paul is one who can comfort other people because no difficulty can touch him. We have seen that Paul and Silas could pray and sing hymns to praise God in their affliction in Philippi (Acts 16:25). These two men needed no wine mingled with gall; they were men who were really crucified on the cross. Stephen could still ask God to forgive the people when he was being stoned (Acts 7:59-60). He did not feel any pain for himself; he needed no wine mingled with gall. He was really a crucified person. The cross means that no matter what pain or difficulty befalls you, you are not touched by it; on the contrary, you can still praise God. If you are always considering how heavy or difficult a matter is, there is no cross.</p><p>May God show us daily what the cross is, and may we know how the cross does not need wine mingled with gall. May God save us from seeking wine mingled with gall and enable us to rejoice and praise on account of Him.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE WASHING OF FEET</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 13:1-14</h1><p>The Gospel of John shows us clearly that water signifies life. John 4 tells us how, after we have received life, it will become a spring in us welling up into eternal life. Chapter seven, in addition, shows us how this water will be like rivers of living water flowing out of man's innermost being. In chapter thirteen water has another function. Water is not just a spring welling up from within us to satisfy us; it does not just add strength to us to flow into others as rivers of living waters; it can also give us refreshment, new feeling, and new help. According to man's mind there seems to be no need for chapter thirteen. Chapters four and seven seem to be sufficient. There are springs within and rivers without. What else do we need? It seems that there is no other need. But let us stop and think for a moment. We have been born again, but do we sometimes still feel as if we were not born again? In theory we know that the water the Lord gives us will become in us a spring welling up into eternal life, but have we not felt that this spring of living water is not welling up constantly? Are we saying with our mouth that we are satisfied and have no more need, yet at times feeling dissatisfied within? Have we not felt some lack, some need, and some dissatisfaction within, and nothing seemed to be welling up or flowing into others? Brothers and sisters, because our spiritual condition inevitably becomes dry and depressed at times, there is need for the water of chapter thirteen.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF THE FOOT-WASHING</h2><p>John 13:1 says, "Having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the uttermost." Verse 5 then says that the Lord washed the disciples' feet with water. It is clear that the motivation of the Lord Jesus' washing the disciples' feet was not because of their sin but because He loved His own, and this love was not an initial love but a consummate love. "Having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the uttermost." Eventually, with the addition of washing, this love was made perfect. Therefore, foot-washing is necessary. If we want to have a proper walk before the Lord, we must know how to receive foot-washing from others and how to wash others' feet. Foot-washing is the expression of the Lord's consummate love and the work of the Lord's lasting love; it is related to the consummation of our Christian life. In other words, we must have the experience of receiving foot-washing from others as well as the experience of washing others' feet.</p><p>The Lord said to Peter, "Unless I wash you, you have no part with Me." Does this mean that if the Lord had not washed Peter's feet that day, He would have had nothing to do with Peter at all? No. Peter had taken his bath already; the Lord already had something to do with Peter. For eternity the Lord will have something to do with Peter. But if the Lord had not washed Peter's feet, Peter would have had no part with Him in His fellowship and would have been detached from Him. We should remember that the foot-washing in John 13 has nothing to do with sin but with life and power; it is a question of freshness of life. In Asia Minor, people rarely wore socks; they wore sandals. Whenever they walked, they would inevitably collect some dust on their feet. After they finished their work and went home to rest, they would go and wash their feet. Their feet became dirty not because of sin but because they had touched the ground; it was inevitable that their feet would be defiled by the dust. The Lord Jesus did not rebuke the disciples for having defiled their feet. On the contrary, He washed their feet because He loved them to the uttermost. The defiling of their feet was not a question of sin. If it had been a question of sin, the Lord Jesus would not have dealt with them this way. He cannot deal with sin so loosely. Those who know God know that Christians should not sin. Yet they also admit that it is impossible for Christians not to defile their feet while walking on this earth. Until we can walk on the golden street in the New Jerusalem, our feet will always be defiled by the dust no matter how carefully we walk or how hard we try to remain undefiled. When our feet are defiled, our spiritual condition becomes dim and not so fresh. Therefore, our feet need to be washed in order for our spiritual condition to be restored. The Lord's washing of the disciples' feet was just to deal with their dimness and lack of freshness; it was not to deal with the problem of sin. In order to deal with sin, it takes the washing by the blood. We must have the blood before we can have the boldness to go before God. But the blood alone is not enough. Although we are under the cleansing of the blood, we do not necessarily have the spiritual freshness; we still need the cleansing of the water. After we are washed with water, we feel refreshed and pleasant, and spontaneously our being is restored. The washing of the blood enables us to stand before God, but the washing of the water refreshes us and makes us feel pleasant and energized.</p><p>Satan's power is based on sin and death. Hebrews 2 shows us that Satan's power is with death. Satan attacks God's children by causing them either to sin or feel deadened. Therefore, we must not only be kept clean but must also be full of life. This does not mean that the life we received at regeneration will die and that we need another one. It means that the life in us may become deadened, as if it were not there. One of our common but serious mistakes is to think that keeping ourselves from sin on the negative side is sufficient. Little do we realize that we fall far short if we have not manifested life on the positive side. Satan's work is either to make us sin or to make us gloomy. He will make us feel as if nothing is meaningful, as if we are cold, far from God, and have a separating veil between us and God. Sometimes we may feel that we have not committed any specific sin, yet inwardly we feel cold, stale, and debilitated. This is death. Many Christians lack spiritual vitality. They do not have any particular weakness or sin, but they always feel apathetic, cold, and debilitated. We need to remember that no gloomy Christian can fight against Satan. Not only will sin disable us from the battle, but gloom will also disable us. Therefore, we need to keep ourselves not only from sin but also from gloom. We can mention some concrete examples of this gloom. How many times do we come to the meetings with life, and how many times are we void of spiritual vitality? In other words, how many times do we come in an active way, and how many times do we come in a passive way? Anything that is not active is death. In the meetings, the listeners as well as the speakers need life. Many people come to the meetings in a gloomy, tired, and weary mood; they have no spiritual vitality at all. If too many people are this way in the meetings, the burden of the meeting will become heavy, and no one will be able to bear it. Hence, whenever there is a meeting, everyone who comes to the meeting should supply the church with life, not just the speaking ones. We cannot be passive for one day. Whenever we are passive in the meeting, we burden the church. Satan's special tool in the church is death. His purpose is just to consume our life and to infect us with death. But the Lord will preserve us and keep us from death.</p><p>Once our spiritual condition becomes sullen, we need to be washed with water. Therefore, the Lord Jesus not only wants us bathed, but He also wants our feet washed again and again. The one-time "bath" enables us to have life. The foot-washing recovers the freshness of life. Once a man is bathed, he has life. Hallelujah! We have all been bathed. If we have not been bathed, we are not Christians yet. One day, the Lord washed me not only with the blood but also with water. I received God's life, I touched God, and I touched the Lord. At that time, a spiritual world opened to me, and I touched spiritual reality. I felt that the Lord's death was not something that happened two thousand years ago; it was something for today. I felt that the Lord's death did not take place only at Golgotha but right where I was. The limitations of time and space were broken, and spiritual reality was present. This is what it means to be bathed. But how many Christians have a continual sense of the freshness of this bathing? Many people say that they will be content as long as they can keep their first love. Many people aspire to return to the condition of their initial salvation. This means that they are not as fresh as when they were first bathed. This is the reason there is the need of foot-washing. Foot-washing brings us back to the condition of being bathed. Foot-washing brings us the freshness of life; it brings us new feelings, new strength, and spiritual revival. These are the things foot-washing brings us. Foot-washing not only cleanses a person but also refreshes him. After a man has his feet washed, he is refreshed and revived. Foot-washing recovers our spiritual freshness and causes us to be full of life. Brothers and sisters, foot-washing is a crucial thing. It is crucial to be recovered in life and in spiritual vitality.</p><h2 class="head1">WASHING ONE ANOTHER'S FEET</h2><p>After the Lord Jesus washed His disciples' feet, He also commanded them, "You also ought to wash one another's feet." This shows us that the church needs to continue the work of foot-washing. We have to wash each others' feet.</p><p>Let me ask if you have had the following kind of experience. On a certain day you felt that your spiritual vitality was completely sapped and you were depressed. You checked with yourself and did not discover any particular weakness or sin within. The only thing you felt was tiredness and a lack of energy. You went to a brother's home. He was a good teacher, and he gave you a good message. But the more he spoke, the colder you became. You left and went to another brother's house. You prayed with him and nothing seemed to have changed. After you left his house, you met another brother who did not preach to you or pray with you; he merely chatted with you a little. However, that little, unintentional time of talking and listening gave you strength and energy. After those few words, you could sing again. When you met him, you were grim. But after you talked with him, you began to say hallelujah. Before you met him, you could talk, but only reluctantly. After you talked with him, the whole situation changed, and you touched life. That brother supplied you with life. He washed your feet. Foot-washing is to supply other members in the church with life.</p><p>After a day's work in a factory or in a school, you often feel very tired and spiritually debilitated. There is not much desire for reading the Bible or for prayer. While you are in this condition, you may meet a brother in a meeting or at your home who knows the Lord. The minute you touch him, energy comes and you feel that you have touched God. He has supplied you with life and has washed your feet. Once you touch life, your spiritual energy is recovered, and you brighten up once more. This is washing one another's feet.</p><p>Among all the things that Christians can do to help one another, there is nothing more precious than washing one another's feet, and nothing is more important than to supply life to another member of the Body. If a Christian with spiritual weariness and weakness comes to a meeting and leaves as tired as he was before, the meeting is a failure. Every time we come to a meeting, we must bring life to it; otherwise, we will increase the burden of the meeting. Everyone should come to the meeting with life so that other brothers and sisters may touch life. As soon as they touch life, their spiritual gloom will be over. They will be shining, and they will be fresh.</p><p>A brother once attended a preaching meeting. When he came in, he felt very dejected. He checked with himself and asked if there was any particular sin in himself. He could not find any. Were there any particularly bothersome matters? No. Yet he could not lift up his spirit. He began to pray, "Lord, I need the supply of life!" Later, another brother prayed, and his prayer supplied the dejected brother, who then brightened up. This is washing one another's feet.</p><p>If anyone comes to the meeting in a passive way and does not care for anything but simply sits there without expecting anything to happen or helping anyone, he is not washing others' feet. To wash one another's feet means that we want to help others when we come to a meeting and that we want others to receive benefit. We do not need to consciously try to do anything; all we need is a heart to help the brothers. Most importantly, we must not burden the meeting. Sometimes we really feel we are short of strength, and our spirit can hardly be lifted up. At these times, we can open ourselves to the brothers and sisters to wash our feet, cause us to touch God, and render us spiritual help. But we must be careful not to always bring a burden to the meeting. If four hundred out of five hundred brothers bring their burdens to the meeting, this is too heavy for the meeting to bear. Whether or not a meeting is worthwhile before the Lord and whether or not one touches life depends on whether there is more life or more burden. This responsibility rests on every brother and sister. If many spirits are open, the meeting will have no problem at all, and many will spontaneously be revitalized spiritually. But if too many people sit back in a cold way, the meeting will become too hard to bear. Passivity is the heaviest burden to a church. No one can come to the meeting without praying or preparing for it. Everyone should pray and spend time before the Lord. Everyone should render help to the meeting with life. In the church meetings we should help one another, and then we will all be helped. To help one another is to wash one another's feet.</p><p>The Lord said, "If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet." We must remember that the work of foot-washing has been committed to the church. This does not mean that one cannot obtain freshness by coming to the Lord, but it means that the Lord has commanded that we wash one another's feet. If we want to wash others' feet, we ourselves must be fresh first. If the Lord constantly does a new work in us, we always will have a new supply for others. It is a pity if others contact us and find us to be the same as we were five years ago, without anything new to offer. It is a pity if others have to wait a few years or even a few months before they can find something new in us. We need to be aggressive and active before the Lord and not stay still.</p><p>A certain sister, who had received special dealings from the Lord, bore a particular characteristic. Every time others touched her, they could sense God's new work in her and touch the newness of life in her. When others were out of touch with the presence of the Lord and felt spiritually tired, all they had to do was go to her and sit in front of her for a few minutes, and the tiredness would disappear. Something would come out from her, and one would sense the supply of life.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, you need to aspire to be ministers of life to others. Do not ever be disappointed that you are not as eloquent as others, or that you do not have as much Bible knowledge as others. As long as you live in life, you will be able to supply life to other members. Some people begin to pray in the prayer meeting right after they are saved. Their prayers may be very awkward, but when others touch them, they receive light and supply. Yet after these ones have been Christians for a period of time, the life supply in them becomes less and less. Having lived the Christian life for a few years, they pick up much knowledge and many doctrines, yet there is a lack of the supply of life. The supply of life is not a matter of knowledge but a matter of freshness. It is better to have less knowledge and less doctrine than it is to lose the supply of life. We should ask the Lord to deliver us from our inability to supply life and should pray that we live before Him in a genuine way. If we live before the Lord and are in touch with life, we will supply others with life and wash their feet every time we contact them. They will receive the freshness of life and be recovered spiritually.</p><p>We must also remember that foot-washing is a mutual matter. We should learn before the Lord to supply others, and we should also learn to receive the supply from others. The reason we need to be humble is so that we can receive help from others. We need to wash others' dark spots, and we should be willing to let others wash our dark spots. Through this mutual foot-washing, mutual serving, and mutual supplying we can be built up, helped along, and run the race before us.</p><p>Acts 18:5 is a very precious word, "And when both Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was constrained by the word." This shows us that Silas and Timothy supplied life to Paul. Silas and Timothy did not preach to Paul. Their coming was sufficient to cause Paul to be constrained by the word. Paul had been preaching and reasoning in the synagogue and laboring for the work, but upon the arrival of Silas and Timothy, Paul began to be constrained by the word. He was energized because he had received new supply from the two. Indeed, when we contact some people, the mere touch will bring life to us.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, before God we should pursue being used by Him as a minister of life to others. The basic requirement of one who always ministers life to others is to be one who always receives the dealing of the cross. Our natural life must be broken by the Lord. If we do not have the inner working of the cross, we can only minister knowledge or eloquence to others; we cannot minister the Spirit or the life of Christ to them. If our knowledge and eloquence are greater than our spirit, the impression we give to others will be of our knowledge and eloquence rather than of our spirit. We must continually live before the Lord, contacting Him and fellowshipping with Him, before we can minister life to others. We must remember that the supply of life is spontaneous rather than artificial. It is true that we need to wash with water, but this water is not pumped up by human efforts; rather, it flows from the source of life. If we live in life, we will spontaneously have the supply of life and will automatically wash others' feet with life. Others will touch the Lord just by one contact with us; they will feel the Lord's presence and will become more intimate with Him. We need to pray that the Lord grants us grace to reach this goal.</p><p>Note: This chapter is on the spiritual significance of foot-washing. There is, of course, the literal application of foot-washing as an act as mentioned in Genesis 18:4, 19:2, and 1 Timothy 5:10. The latter is an expression of love and humility.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINETEEN</h1><h1 class="title">IN REST SHALL BE YOUR STRENGTH</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Luke 10:38-42; Isa. 30:15; Phil. 4:6-7; Matt. 11:29</h1><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>One day as our Lord came to a certain village, a sister named Martha received Him into her home. She loved our Lord and wanted to do many things for Him in order to please Him. She did this and that; she prepared this thing and that thing. She did many things, but then she became disturbed. Not only was she disturbed, she also worried about many things, and her mind was troubled. Martha, like those who are ill at ease, sought to blame others by going to the Lord and saying, "Lord, does it not matter to You that my sister has left me to serve alone? Tell her then to do her part with me" (Luke 10:40). But the Lord answered, "Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things; but there is need of one thing, for Mary has chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her" (vv. 41-42). Oh, the Lord said that only one thing is needed! Martha did many things, but the Lord said that there was need of only one thing. We plan one thing after another and do one thing after another. It seems that we have planned many things and done much, yet there is need of only one thing! There are not many needful things; there is only one thing which is needful!</p><p>Brothers and sisters, what is the one thing that is needful? It is nothing other than Christ Himself&mdash;this is what Mary chose. We can have this needful thing only by sitting quietly before the Lord as Mary did. Every Christian should work, and it is wrong if anyone does not work. The Bible tells us that the man who will not work should not eat (2 Thes. 3:10). We should work diligently. However, we often find no rest within when we work; we may even feel that we have forgotten the Lord. Sometimes we are so busy from morning till evening that we do not find time for prayer or Bible reading before the Lord. When we labor, do some spiritual work, or give assistance to a brother or sister, our motive is for the Lord, yet eventually we become distracted; our heart is disturbed. The problem is that there are too many things that cause us to forget the Lord and let Him go. Let us listen to the Lord, who is telling us that only one thing is needful! This very thing is to have rest in the Lord and to be content in Him.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>How can we live a peaceful and unperturbed life? Let us see what the Lord said. He did not say that one should not work, nor did He say that one should spend half of his time working and the other half dealing with spiritual things. He did not say to Martha that it was wrong to do many things, but He reminded Martha not to let these things enter into her and disturb her. The Lord Jesus did not say that she had done too much; He said that she had considered too much. He did not say that she had taken up too many tasks; He said that she had taken up too many worries. You may work from morning until evening, but you should not be disturbed by it. Many people do not have much to do outwardly, yet they are very busy inwardly. Some people have already spent five sleepless nights worrying about work that needs to be done five days from now. For instance, you only need one hour to visit a friend tomorrow, yet you spend four hours thinking about it in your bed. This kind of thinking is too much! The Lord did not tell us not to work. He said that we can work as much as we need, but that our heart should not be disturbed about it. The Lord will not say that we have done too much; but He will say that our heart should not be disturbed.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, this is the Christian life. We should work and not be lazy. It is necessary to work and to be occupied, but we should be at peace within. There should only be one thing within us&mdash;Christ. This is what the Lord shows us. The Lord asks only one thing of us&mdash;that we remain untouched by whatever circumstance we are in. Outwardly, we may be very busy doing many things, but inwardly there should be only one thing that we do not let go of by any means. Although we may be busy outwardly, we should maintain our fellowship with God. Thank God that there was not only a Martha but also a Mary. Mary chose the best portion&mdash;fellowship with the Lord. The Lord wanted Martha to learn the way of inward rest from her sister, not the way of work. It is all right for us to be a Martha outwardly, but inwardly we should be like Mary, who was in complete union with the Lord. Although outwardly we can be very busy, inwardly we should fellowship with God and be at rest. This is a most precious experience.</p><p>Brother Lawrence had to prepare meals for many people each day. If we were in his place, we might become so busy that we would lose contact with God. However, Brother Lawrence's inner fellowship with the Lord was not disturbed by external things at all. He was indeed a man who knew the presence of God! Although he was outwardly very busy all the time, inwardly he was sitting at the feet of the Lord all the time. Despite the many outward things he did, he was not distracted by them at all.</p><p>This is a most blessed way of life. Every one of us can live this kind of life, which is not in the physical realm or in our feeling but in the depth of our being. Then we will be in constant fellowship with the Lord, living a peaceful and serene life in His presence. We must remember that God has not asked us to be lazy and do nothing. Rather, the Lord wants us to shoulder outward activities on the strength of His indwelling. Although we may be busy from morning until evening, no person or thing should deprive us of our inner peace and rest. We should be busy outwardly but peaceful inwardly. Brothers and sisters, we must not allow the outward things to come and touch us; we have to resist these outward things and not allow them to affect us. However many things there are, we should not let any of them enter into our being. Within us there should be only one person&mdash;Christ. Inwardly, our only occupation is to have fellowship with Christ; if we allow other things to come into us, our inner peace will flee away.</p><h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>The tabernacle in the Old Testament was divided into the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies. Within the Holy of Holies was the ark in which God dwelt. In the Holy Place, there was the showbread, the golden lampstand, and the golden censer. In the outer court, there was the altar and the laver. Between the Holy of Holies and the Holy Place, there was a separating veil; between the Holy Place and the outer court, a curtain. Only the priests and the Levites could enter into the outer court, and only the priests could go into the Holy Place. Finally, only the high priest could enter into the Holy of Holies once a year with the blood.</p><p>In the New Testament, God speaks through His servant declaring that we are the temple of God (1 Cor. 3:16). The Christian life is likened to God's tabernacle or temple. The outer court was very busy indeed; thousands of Israelites made their offering there, and many Levites spent their days slaying thousands of oxen and sheep. While there were many in the outer court from morning to evening, there was no one in the Holy of Holies. The curtain outside the outer court could be lifted again and again; many people could go in again and again, but the veil over the Holy of Holies remained undisturbed, and no one could enter in. It might have been noisy in the outer court, but the Holy of Holies remained serene and quiet; it might have been very busy in the outer court, but the Holy of Holies was not affected at all. This is the life of a Christian. We may be in contact with thousands of people, but inwardly we should remain undisturbed. Although we may be busy outwardly, we can be undisturbed in spirit and have uninterrupted fellowship with the Lord inwardly. This is what it means to have peace and rest in our human spirit.</p><p>Christians should live in a state of continuous prayer. This is not a matter of praying ten minutes or half an hour, or a brief prayer in the morning which ceases as we go to work. As we live before the Lord, we must maintain our fellowship with Him even though we are outwardly busy. We should have a regular time for prayer and Bible reading, but apart from this time, our inner life should continue to have fellowship with the Lord.</p><p>Remember that the strength of our life depends upon the fellowship of our innermost life with God. Our innermost part should not be controlled or affected by outside factors. When we are quiet inwardly, our outward actions can be made subject to our inward being. Although there is no lampstand, censer, or showbread in the Holy of Holies, it guides all the action of the tabernacle. Therefore, if we live a life of peace and rest in the Holy of Holies, external things cannot touch us; neither can the environment shake us. When we live in the Holy of Holies, we will see that God saturates everything; we will have an intimate and uninterrupted fellowship with God which no outside forces can sever.</p><h2 class="head1">FOUR</h2><p>Brothers and sisters, the one failure in our life is inward disturbance whenever we have outward activities. Many times, even before outward activities come, we are already disturbed within, and this disturbance deprives us of the strength to deal with outward activities. We should know that the strength of our living comes from rest, quietness, and trust. God's Word says, "In returning and rest you will be saved;/In quietness and in trust will be your strength" (Isa. 30:15). Anyone who is easily irritated cannot have strength before God; the same is true for anyone who is disturbed in heart. We should remember that our strength depends upon inner quietness and trust.</p><p>There is an eye in every hurricane. Although the wind turns furiously around the eye, the eye itself is very quiet. Our strength lies in a life that revolves around a stable center. Outward activities may be blowing like furious winds, yet within we can be most peaceful. "In quietness and in trust will be your strength." Our thoughts must not be disturbed because of the multitude of outward activities. If we were disturbed, we would not be able to control our environment. Consider the sea. Although there are high waves, strong winds, and the surface of the sea may be in great turmoil, the depths of the sea have no movement at all; everything is very peaceful below. Those who study marine life on the ocean floors are convinced that there has not been movement for years. The life of a Christian should be characterized by quietness and trust. We cannot expect to be idle, but we can expect peace and quietness in the midst of a busy daily life. There can be much activity outwardly, yet there is peace and quietness inwardly. The peace that we seek is inner peace. When there is inner peace, we will not fail. No matter how circumstances change, we should live before the Lord as if nothing has happened. We should realize that the Lord within wants us to live a peaceful life.</p><p>Our Lord was never affected by the outward circumstances. On one occasion, the people in the synagogue persecuted Him and wanted to push Him over a precipice. If it had been us, we would have run away. But the Bible says that the Lord Jesus went His way, passing through the midst of them. These people wanted to kill Him, but He was not concerned and went His way (Luke 4:28-30). When a storm raged, the Lord was fast asleep, but the disciples cried, "We are perishing!" Why did they cry? They had no rest. But the Lord remained unaffected (Matt. 8:23-27). When the band of soldiers and officers came to arrest Him, He asked them, "Whom do you seek?" They answered Him, "Jesus the Nazarene." Jesus said to them, "I am." When they heard this, they drew back and fell to the ground. Those who tried to make an arrest were scared by the One they sought to arrest (John 18:2-6). Oh, the Lord deserves our continuous praise. He was never moved by outward events but lived according to His inner being.</p><h2 class="head1">FIVE</h2><p>How can we have this inner peace? The following Scriptures tell us two conditions.</p><p>First, Philippians 4:6-7 says, "In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses every man's understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus." The first thing that enables us to have peace is to bring all our matters and requests to God. Our work, our need, and the difficulties we encounter should all be committed to the Lord. We should say to the Lord, "Lord, I commit all these things to Your hand." We can commit to the Lord whatever we encounter through prayer, petition, and thanksgiving, and the peace of God will keep our heart and mind. God will keep us. All we need to do is make our request known through prayer and petition with thanksgiving. As soon as we encounter any matter, we have to commit that matter to God immediately. Once we have made such a commitment, God's peace keeps us. Whenever we make our commitment to God, His peace will come. As a result, we will be free from outside influence all the time. Regardless of how great the difficulty or how numerous the activities, the peace of God in us will guard our hearts.</p><p>Second, Matthew 11:29 says, "Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls." The first condition is faith, and the second condition is obedience. God allows many things to come upon us. If we reject what God wants for us, if we do not accept His will, or if we have other desires, we will lose our rest within. We should realize that rest comes from consecration. Therefore, when any difficulty arises, we need to take His yoke and learn from Him. Although we may not be able to act according to our own wish and may have to suffer, we will have rest. We will have rest if we say to the Lord, "Lord, whatever You want me to do, I am willing." However, if we are not willing to obey, if we choose our own pathway or our own way of life, or if we cherish our own desire, we will lose the rest. All of our personal desires and dissatisfactions will deprive us of our peace within. Peace will fill our heart when we say to the Lord, "Lord, everything that You give me is the best. I am willing to take Your way, choose Your will, and set aside my own wish."</p><p>May the Lord grant us grace to believe that He can bear all our burdens and difficulties and make us willing to yield to His will for us. May we be able to respond to all of God's demands on us by saying, "I am willing." Oh, may the Lord show us that rest only comes from faith and obedience in Him. Rest cannot come as long as unbelief and self-will exist. If we believe in God and obey Him, no outward event can disturb us any longer. Our constant fellowship with the Lord will enable us to bear all outward things. May we all see that in rest shall be our strength.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY</h1><h1 class="title">THE CONTINUATION<br />OF THE BOOK OF ACTS</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 28:30-31; Rev. 1:11-12, 20</h1><p>There are sixty-six books in the Bible. When we come to the end of many of these books, we can say that the book is finished. There are fifty chapters in Genesis, and when we come to the end, we sense that we have come to the end. The Gospel of Matthew has twenty-eight chapters. When we come to chapter twenty-eight, we feel that we have come to the end. When we come to the Romans 16, we also feel that this is the end. When we read Revelation 22, we also feel that this is the end.</p><p>But there is one book in the Bible which does not have an end. All the other sixty-five books have an end. But one book does not have an end. This book is the Acts of the Apostles. Why does Acts 28 end the way it does? When you read Acts 28, you feel as if the book has not yet concluded. This book does not have an ending. The Acts of the Apostles is a book without an ending because this book is still being continued. Perhaps the acts of the first century apostles have ended, but the book of Acts as a whole has not yet ended. Until now we still have the Acts of the Apostles with us. This book has not yet ended.</p><p>The Lord said, "My Father is working until now, and I also am working" (John 5:17). This shows that since the rebellion of Satan and the fall of man, God has been working until now, and the Lord is also working. What is the book of Acts? The book of Acts is not a record of the work of Paul or a record of the work of Peter or John. The book of Acts is a record of the work of God. Who can say that God has done no work after Acts 28? Who can say that God's work stopped after Acts 28?</p><p>The book of Acts does not have an ending. After chapter twenty-eight, many of God's vessels are still carrying on with His work. His work is continuing and has not stopped. Everything was not over after Paul worked in Rome for two years. Paul lived in Rome and was later martyred. None of these things are recorded in the book of Acts. Peter, Paul, and John are three important persons, yet none of their endings were recorded. How can we say that the book of Acts has ended? God's testimony can never be finished. We could say the same thing even if there was a twenty-ninth chapter, or a thirtieth chapter, or even a hundredth chapter. If one wanted to write more, new things could always be added. This is why Acts stops at chapter twenty-eight. Although the written record no longer continued after chapter twenty-eight, God's work has been going on. The work in the first century was not the peak. For four thousand years, God has been working. If we say that Acts 28 was the peak, we must be at the bottom of the hill; we must have come down from the peak. This is not true because the Lord said, "My Father is working until now, and I also am working." We should not assume that God's work reached its peak at the time of Paul, and we should not consider that God's work reached its peak at the time of Martin Luther either. No, the first century was not the end of God's work, nor was the sixteenth century the end of His work. Even last century was not the end of God's work. His work will go on until the kingdom and even until the new heaven and the new earth. God is always advancing; He never stops. If we know this and believe in this, we will praise our Lord.</p><p>Man always has a misconception that his age is the worst age of the church. At the time of Martin Luther some thought this way. At the time of John Wesley some thought this way. We consider Martin Luther's time a marvelous age and John Wesley's time a marvelous age also. While we consider their ages marvelous, some who come fifty years after us will say that we were at a marvelous age. We are afraid that man will stop. But God never stops. Every year, He knows what He is doing, and He knows how much He will work. Every year, He does what He wants to do. He is a God who goes on day by day; He is always advancing. Hallelujah! God is a God who keeps on advancing!</p><p>Every time God advances, He finds some vessels. In the book of Acts, God found some vessels. At the time of Martin Luther, God found a vessel, and at the time of John Wesley, He also found a vessel. Every time there is a spiritual revival, God finds some vessels. Where is God's vessel today? It is true that the Father is working until now. But who is continuing to work together with Him? Who can say, "I also am working"? This is the crucial question.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, if God grants us light and if we see God's truth, we will admit that God is after the same vessel today that He ordained at the beginning. This vessel is the church. In other words, God is not after an individual vessel today, but a corporate one. Since God is after a corporate vessel, His children must be brought to the awareness of the Body of Christ and the Body life. Otherwise, they are useless in His hand and can never fulfill His goal.</p><p>Revelation 1 tells us that the churches are golden lampstands. God does not simply say that the churches are golden; He says that the churches are golden lampstands. If the churches are just golden, they cannot satisfy God. God says that the churches are golden lampstands because golden lampstands shine and enlighten. God desires the church to be a shining vessel, a vessel of testimony. From the beginning God has ordained that the church be a lampstand. The church, not individuals, is a lampstand before the Lord. It is not enough just to be golden, and it is not enough just to be of God. There must be the shining for God and the testimony for Him before the church can be considered the lampstand.</p><p>Hence, the church exists for God's testimony. Anything that is not golden is not the church, and anything that is not a lampstand is not the church. Anything that does not have life within is not the church, and anything that does not have the testimony within is also not the church. The church must realize what God is doing and what He is after in this age; it must realize what God's testimony on the earth today is. Only then can the church be considered the golden lampstand.</p><p>Simply put, God's work is always advancing. He is still seeking this vessel. His vessel today is the same vessel He intended to have at the beginning; the church is this vessel, not single individuals.</p><p>Some may ask: What does it mean that the overcomers come out of the church? It is true that there needs to be overcomers that come out of the church. But even the testimony of the overcomers is maintained on behalf of the corporate whole; it is not for individuals alone. The overcomers are not men who consider themselves extraordinary, better than others, and who put everyone else aside. The overcomers work on behalf of the whole church. They do the work, while the whole church gains the benefit. The overcomers are not for themselves; they stand on the ground of the church, and they are there to bring the whole church to perfection. They stand on the ground of the church and maintain their stand on behalf of the church. Even the victories of the overcomers are corporate victories.</p><p>The vessel God is after is a corporate one. Therefore, we have to learn to live the Body life. In order to live the Body life, we have to deny the natural life and be judged and dealt with by God in a deep way. We must learn obedience, and we must also learn fellowship. In this way, we will have the chance of becoming God's vessel.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">THE SEED OF GOD</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 13:3, 19, 24, 37; John 12:24-26</h1><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>Of the seven parables in Matthew 13, the first two are the parable of the sower and the parable of the good seed and the tares. In the first parable, the Lord told the disciples that the seed sown by the sower is the word of God, which is the word of the kingdom. In the second parable, He told the disciples that the sower is the Son of Man, and the good seeds are the sons of the kingdom. In the first parable, the seed is the word of the kingdom, which is the word of God. In the second parable, the seeds are the sons of the kingdom, who are the ones begotten of God. When the Lord sowed the seed, He was sowing not only the word but also men. When the Lord came to the earth, He did not just preach the word, He also sought a group of people and sowed this group of people as seeds. What He sowed was people.</p><p>In the Bible, the words that come out of God's mouth are called God's word, but the Son sent by God is also called God's Word. John 1:1 says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." This Word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth. We know that this refers to the Lord Jesus. The word of God as revealed in the Bible sometimes refers to the words which God has spoken and sometimes to the Word whom God has begotten, that is, the Son of God. He is the Word, the living Word, the Word of life. When you hear Him, you hear the Word. When you see Him, you see the Word. When you touch Him, you touch the Word. This is what 1 John 1:1 tells us.</p><p>Our Lord Jesus is the Word of God. He is also the seed of God. John 12:24 says, "Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit." This refers to the Lord Jesus. He is the one grain of wheat, and from this grain, many grains have been produced. First Peter 1:23 says, "Having been regenerated not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible, through the living and abiding word of God." The Lord Jesus is the Word, and He is also the seed.</p><p>We have to praise Him because He is not just the Word but also the seed. Our God sent His Son to the earth and sowed Him as a seed. The Lord Jesus did not come to preach but to be the Word. The Lord was not just the One speaking the word; He was the Word itself. The Lord was not just the sower; He was the very seed. God did not just sow a few words; He sowed a man. The Lord Jesus was truly the seed, the real seed.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>Suppose someone comes from a far country and invites us to go to preach the gospel. If we have zeal and are for the gospel, we would surely be very willing to go. But we have to realize that it is not enough just to have someone speak the word and preach the gospel. God has to sow us, the person, as a seed among them. Do we see this? God is sowing us; we are the seed that is being sown. God works through His own words within man. When we preach the word to others, we are sowing the word of God into them, and we expect to have a harvest. But if we only see the seed as the words of God, and not as people, we cannot work for God. If we only care for the words we preach and if we presume that as long as we are right in our fundamental belief and pure in our biblical exegesis, we can go forth to sow, we are wrong. God's work often suffers loss because the seed in our hand is merely objective truths. These truths have not brought about a subjective change in our being yet; they have not made us sons of the kingdom yet. The great question is what kind of person are we? God's seed is not just words but also us as people. The good seed is not just the word of the kingdom; it is people, that is, the sons of the kingdom. I would like to ask how many of us can be God's seed? What a pity that most of our seeds are objective; we lack subjective seeds! Brothers and sisters, whether or not we can be seeds of God is a big question. The Lord has no intention of sending out a group of evangelists or a group of people to teach the Bible. His intention is that some become seeds. The Lord wants to sow those who are His as seeds. If the Lord sows us as seeds, what will be the result of this sowing? Whatever a man sows, he will reap. Those to whom we render some help often become like us. Putting it the other way around, our reaping proves what we sow; it proves the kind of people we are.</p><p>Therefore, we should never bemoan the fact that no one has listened to our preaching or say that we cannot do anything just because others' ears are dull of hearing God's pure word. The question is: Who are we? The good seed is not only the word of the kingdom but also the sons of the kingdom. God is sowing us, but what will come out? Do we preach something that is far away from us in another world, or is it a fact that is present in us? Do we speak directly from a passage of the Scripture, or do we first touch a spiritual reality and then confirm it with a passage from the Scripture? We have to realize that there is a great difference between these two things. Many words are only opinions. Only the words of those who know God are seeds. It is not a matter of coming up with all kinds of things and doctrines through our own wisdom and then telling others about them. When we know something and see something before the Lord, we sow it into others with our words. In conveying God's word, it is not a question of how much we can say with our mouth but how much constitution is in our life. Are we merely preaching an objective doctrine, or are we speaking something because we have first acquired the subjective experience of it? Many people can only preach objective doctrines; however, objective doctrines will not produce any effect in others. If, in addition to speaking God's word, we have become the very word ourselves, others will receive help from us. It is not enough just to understand God's word with our mind. If it were just a question of understanding doctrine, wise Christians would have an advantage over foolish ones, and wise ones would be better Christians, while foolish ones would not be such good Christians. But God does not classify men according to whether they are wise or foolish. When God's word comes to us, it must be tested. When a potter paints a picture on porcelain-ware, it must pass through fire before the picture becomes non-erasable by hand. The porcelain must pass through fire before it will withstand any washing by water. Many have doctrines that are erasable by hand. But if God is gracious to us and if He works in us and does some burning work in us through the environment and through revelation, the result will be something firm and permanent. God may do this once, ten times, dozens of times, and even a few hundred times. One day the words will become words that have passed through the fire; they will be wrought into us. Then our person will become the word. The discipline and revelation of the Holy Spirit will sear a word into a person one, ten, or even a hundred times. In the end, the person will become the word. When others see him, they will not say that this person is capable of speaking the word; they will say that this person is the word itself. He will become the seed of God, and God will be able to propagate such a word. Otherwise, the word will merely be passed on from head to head, and the church will become more and more superficial, lifeless, and void of spiritual reality. The question then is whether or not we can be the seed of God. Which part in us can be the seed of God? If God sows us, what will grow up? Whatever a man sows, he will reap. There can be no exception to this. If the only fruit we bear for others is a greater understanding of doctrine, without any touch of the Lord's life, what we have will be very poor.</p><h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>God sows with the purpose of reaping a harvest. Let us now consider the principle of God's harvesting.</p><p>John 12:24 says, "Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit." This word refers to the Lord dying for us and dispensing His life into us. The pathway to a harvest is through death. One must pass through the cross. God sows with the goal of gaining some fruit; His goal is for the one grain of wheat to bear many grains. God did not send one prophet or many prophets to men to expound the word clearly. In sending His Son, God made Him the one grain. Only when this one grain fell into the ground did many grains come forth. Fruit-bearing does not come through a clear exposition of the word or through the hard memorization of the Scriptures. When the seed falls into the ground many grains are brought forth. This is the work of the cross.</p><p>The cross is a fact; it is not a doctrine. If there is indeed death, there will indeed be fruit. If there is no death, there will be no fruit. The measure of death determines the measure of life. The number of blows one suffers determines the measure of the outflow of life.</p><p>No doubt verse 24 refers to the Lord Himself. But in verse 25, He gives us a word of explanation. His word speaks of a principle that not only applies to Himself but also applies in general. "He who loves his soul-life loses it; and he who hates his soul-life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life." This word is for everyone. Verse 26 says, "If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me." This makes it more clear; everyone who serves Him has to go through the same experience. The falling of the grain into the ground to die does not refer to redemption (in which we can never have a part) but to the removal of the self-life. The principle is that death brings in life. This is what Paul meant when he said that death operated in him and life in others (2 Cor. 4:12).</p><p>Hence, it is not enough for us to be a seed; we must know the way to bear fruit. The way to bear fruit is not by preaching or teaching; the way to bear fruit is by sowing. God did not send His Son to the earth to preach the word; He sowed His Son as a seed into the ground. Today He is also sowing us here and there as seeds.</p><p>A seed must fall into the ground to die before it can bear much fruit. Before a grain of wheat falls into the ground, it has an outward shell. This shell protects the grain from any harm, yet it also frustrates it from bringing forth many grains. If the outward shell is not broken, the life within will not be released. When the grain is put into the ground and the water and the soil act on it organically, the shell soon breaks and decays, and the life within is released. The Lord is the one grain that fell into the ground and died. When this grain died, it brought forth many grains. From death unto life&mdash;this is the way with the Lord, and this is the way with us. Fruit-bearing through death&mdash;this is the way with the Lord, and this is the way with us. Hence, the principle of fruit-bearing is not preaching but death. Once we touch a person, we immediately know whether or not he has fallen into the ground to die. In order to know whether or not a person has died, we only have to find out whether the shell still remains. Much of our hardness is natural hardness, and much of our softness is natural softness. Whether it is hard or soft, as long as it is a shell, it frustrates the outflow of life and prevents men from touching the life within. Only the work of the cross will remove the outer shell from us. It is very difficult to touch a person who has not been broken. After one speaks to such a person for an hour, he still feels that there is a great distance between them. With him, there is a shell. But a person who has been smitten, stricken, and broken by God will have his natural and soulish elements shattered. When others touch him, they will touch life. Only those who have fallen into the ground and died will bear fruit! Only those who have passed through death will bear fruit before the Lord. Without passing through death, there cannot be fruit. There may be hundreds and thousands of people following you, but you may still have no fruit before the Lord. The principle of fruit-bearing is to die and then to bring forth many grains. If one does not die, he remains one grain. If a grain of seed has not passed through death, it will not bring forth any fruit.</p><p>May the Lord be merciful to us so that we can become the seed of God and fall into the ground and die, and so that He can gain fruit in us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">HE HAS FILLED THE HUNGRY<br />WITH GOOD THINGS</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Luke 1:53; Matt. 5:6; 2 Kings 4:1-6</h1><p>Christians have two great deficiencies before God. One is the failure to know themselves, and the other is the failure to know the riches of the Lord. It would be wonderful if a Christian knew himself and knew the riches of the Lord. If he does not know himself or the Lord's riches, he is doomed to failure. All shortcomings, failures, and things that do not glorify God in the Christian life can be traced to one of these two deficiencies. These two matters are the roots of all our failures. On the one hand, the Lord's work on us shows us what we are and, on the other hand, what He is. If we knew ourselves and if we knew Him, all spiritual problems would be solved.</p><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>At this point I would like to bring one thing to our attention. What is the necessary condition for experiencing the Lord's riches? In other words, what is the necessary condition for receiving God's blessing or the working of the Holy Spirit? This is something we must see; it is a condition which we must fulfill. If we do not meet this condition, we cannot expect to receive anything from the Lord. This necessary condition is being empty before God. If we want to be filled with the Lord's riches continually, we have to be emptied continually. The emptying experience is an ever-deepening experience. Therefore, we can never say that we are completely empty or that we cannot be emptied any further. Brothers and sisters, we need to be emptied day after day, month after month, and year after year. We may be empty now, but after some time we will need a further emptying work. We should not think that once we are emptied, we will be empty forever. We also should not think that once we are filled, we will be filled forever. We should have an ever-deepening knowledge of ourselves, and we should have an ever-deepening knowledge of the riches of the Lord.</p><p>Luke 1:53 says, "The hungry He has filled with good things, and the rich He has sent away empty." This verse shows us that God's grace is reserved for one type of person&mdash;a hungry one. If a person comes to the meeting only for the purpose of observing and listening, he will not see anything or hear anything. If all that a person wants is some Bible knowledge, his real spiritual problems will not be solved. Only those with a pressing inward need and those who are determined to meet God will receive His blessing. We must realize that spiritual progress is based on our hunger. Matthew 5:6 says, "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied." Those who hunger and thirst will be filled; they are the ones who are blessed.</p><p>According to the Word of God and the experience of many saints, the first thing the Holy Spirit does within a person (which is the same work He does within everyone) is to create a longing heart in him. All spiritual progress begins when God initiates a good work in a person through the Holy Spirit by creating a longing within. Every time there is any spiritual progress, the Holy Spirit has initiated it. The Holy Spirit makes us feel dissatisfied with our present condition; the Holy Spirit makes us feel that our present condition is wrong and that our spiritual life is too shallow. The first work of the Holy Spirit is to give us a sense of dissatisfaction and to create in us a desire to be better. Brothers and sisters, if we want to have any spiritual progress, we must first become dissatisfied with our present spiritual condition, and we must seek for something better. This is the beginning of spiritual progress. Putting it another way, all failure and decadence is the result of self-complacency. The beginning of failure is self-complacency. Our feelings of dissatisfaction with ourselves indicates the Holy Spirit has begun His work in us and that is the time for us to go forward. Whenever we are ignorant of our poverty and deficiency, we have come to a standstill. Decadence comes from self-complacency, whereas progress comes from hunger. This is a fact, and it is true throughout our Christian life. Invariably the Holy Spirit first creates a desire in us for more, and then God comes in to satisfy us and fill us. In order to perform His filling work, He must first carry out His emptying work. When we are empty, God will fill us.</p><p>Some brothers and sisters have a genuine desire before the Lord and are genuinely conscious of their deficiencies and shortcomings. They earnestly hope to live a better and fuller life. However, they do not know how they can achieve this, and they do not know how they can have an abundant life. Brothers and sisters, if we have such a feeling, we can rest assured that this life will be ours. This is because the desire does not originate from ourselves but from the work of the Holy Spirit in us. We should realize that God Himself fills up whatever He has emptied. God will not leave us empty forever; His purpose is to fill us. Since God has emptied us, He will surely fill us. If He did not want to fill us, He would not have emptied us in the first place. Emptying is merely the means; filling is the goal. Therefore, God never empties anyone without filling him again. If there is a longing heart in us, it proves that we are already under the operating power of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit never engages Himself in a fruitless work. The only question is whether or not there is some hindrance within us. If there is a genuine desire within us, we will certainly receive what we desire. Please bear in mind and be deeply impressed that once the Holy Spirit begins His work, He always finishes it. He will never stop until the job is done. Therefore, we may rest assured that when we are empty, He will fill us.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>It is an amazing thing that in our experience the Holy Spirit can empty us. Many genuine Christians have passed through such an experience. When we first became a Christian, we considered ourselves to be rather good and capable in everything. But after some time we noticed that the life we were living was short of the Christian standard; we realized that we had failed and could not go on anymore. Consequently, we felt dissatisfied, and we prayed for God to fill us up and make us obedient. God then ordered some unbearable and distasteful circumstances to come upon us. Yet by the grace of God, we eventually overcame them. Then we had something to testify about, and we were be able to say that we overcame. We were able to say that we overcame a certain particular matter and that, at a certain point in time, God filled us. We may have even thought that we would be an overcomer from that point on. But surprisingly, after some time, the victory was lost, and failure came back again. We thought that it was very easy to overcome, but it seemed as if all strength was gone, and new obstacles were before us again. There seemed to be a wall in front of us; we could not find any way out, and there did not seem to be any way to bypass it. Consequently, we said that our previous victory was lost, and we were no longer filled with God.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, have you ever had such an experience? What is the significance of this kind of experience? You should bear in mind that in God's eyes the Christian life should be an ever-deepening life. A Christian should become emptier and emptier, and the Lord's riches to him should become fuller and fuller. After passing the first hurdle, you may think that there can be no higher life than what you have experienced; you may think that you can advance no further and that you have reached the summit. The Lord knows your condition. He does not want you to think that you have abundant life already. Therefore, He allows new difficulties to come upon you, and He places impossible things before you. Based on your past experiences, you may think that you will overcome again. But you fail at your first attempt. You may attribute your failure to the lack of vigilance and effort, and you may take greater care and exert more energy in tackling the situation the second time. Yet you fail again. You may think that your vigilance and effort is still too short and that you ought to exercise greater care and exert more energy. Yet the result again falls short of your expectation, and you fail once more. Eventually, you will find that you cannot overcome this hurdle; there is no way to handle the matter. You will be at a loss as to why you cannot overcome. You will wonder why you still fail and why the initial power of obedience is gone. At the same time, you will realize that it is not right that you repeatedly fail, and you will agonize over these failures. But God has only one reason for doing this&mdash;to lead you on further and to dig more deeply into you so that you may receive more filling. This is why new difficulties are in front of you all the time. Unless you have fresh filling, you will not be able to overcome these fresh difficulties. You should bear in mind that the further you go forward, the more difficulties there will be. All your difficulties are ordered by the Holy Spirit for the purpose of creating a stronger craving and hunger in you for Him.</p><h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>The victory at Jericho can never be applied to Ai. Although Ai is very small and Jericho, which is huge, has been taken, if we attack Ai by applying our past experience, we will fail. This means we cannot apply our past victory to tackle our spiritual difficulties today. The past has become history, and new power is needed to deal with new spiritual difficulties. God puts new difficulties before us in order to make us sense new needs. We must never expect to have a once-for-all victory. Our eyes must be opened before God, and we must realize that the only way to have a continual filling is to have the continual working of the cross. Unless the Holy Spirit continues His work in us, we cannot continue to overcome. When any trial confronts us or any difficulty is placed before us, no past history or experience will do any good; we need new strength to go on.</p><p>Let us bear in mind that everything ordered by the Lord in our circumstances is intended to create a need in us and make us realize that we cannot overcome by past experience. Past victories remain unchanged, but trying to overcome new difficulties by means of past victories never works. Many people look at their past victories and wonder why they cannot overcome now. Brothers and sisters, we have to realize that God does not want us to have yesterday's manna. With each new difficulty there comes a new need which we have never realized before. Brothers and sisters, we cannot go on without new knowledge of the Lord and a new vision of Him. Whenever He brings us to our end and whenever we find ourselves crying, "I cannot make it!", our progress has begun. Then God is able to easily create a desire for Him in us. Is it not clear to us that our hunger begins from this kind of experience?</p><p>Thank God that everything we have is the result of His work; even the heart that seeks after Him comes from Him. If it were up to us, I wonder how long we would have to wait before we would seek after Him? Of course, there is a condition: we must be conscious of our weakness and inability as well as the hindrance and pride of the flesh. If we persist in our self-reliance, presume that we are already rich, and do not forget our Jericho victory, it will be impossible for God to give us a seeking heart even if He wants to. If we cannot forget our past victory, we will never make any progress. If we think that we can overcome with our first experience, we have been defeated already. Past victory can never be our present strength. We should remember that God gives difficulties to us in order to dig more deeply in us so that He can fill us more with Himself.</p><h2 class="head1">FOUR</h2><p>Living faith never imitates past deeds. The Bible never tells us to imitate the deeds of others' faith even though it tells us to imitate others' faith (Heb. 6:12; 13:7). To imitate faith and to imitate the deeds of faith are two entirely different things. We should imitate the faith of the apostles, but we should not imitate the deeds of their faith. Their shadows, handkerchiefs, and aprons were capable of healing the sick (Acts 5:15; 19:12), but this does not mean that we can do the same. Even if we do the same thing, the sick will not be healed because we would only be imitating the deeds of the apostles' faith and not their faith. Sometimes a person suffers from a certain illness and God heals him. But this does mean that we can be sick with the same illness and expect God to heal us. God never allows us to imitate the deeds of others' faith. We often travel a long way before we find out that we are imitating the deeds of others' faith instead of imitating their faith. We often have to pass through many difficulties before we find out that imitating the deeds of faith is a dead end. When we cannot make it and realize that we have come to the end of the road, our prayer will become real and genuine. Only then will we really seek after God. Up to that point, our prayer will merely be mindless words, habitual and unintended. But when we reach that point, our prayer will become genuine. We will become genuinely empty, and we will confess, "I am useless. Even the victory I had before cannot help me now." When we compare the difficulty God has given us with the strength we now have, we will realize that there is no way we can overcome. Then we will genuinely seek after the Lord and be conscious of our uselessnes. We will not need someone to tell us to be humble; we will spontaneously be humble. Our humility will not be a thing taught by others but something that swells up within us spontaneously. Then we will truly know that everything we have is vanity, and we will understand the meaning of "apart from Me you can do nothing" (John 15:5).</p><p>Brothers and sisters, God desires to see you seeking after Him in a genuine way. Therefore, He places trials and difficulties before you. When these things are before you, you should honestly seek after Him. When you really need His power, you will realize that you can do nothing apart from Him. It is true that when you do things according to your own design, you apparently can do quite a bit. But when you have to do something according to God's design, you will find out that you need His power. Without His power we cannot do anything. Brothers and sisters, we must realize that God has ruled us out on the cross already! We have often overestimated ourselves. In reality, we have been ruled out by God on the cross already. Golgotha is where we were ruled out. We ourselves no longer exist. Brothers and sisters, whenever we become empty, the Lord will fill us up. The Word of God plainly promises: "The hungry He has filled with good things" (Luke 1:53a). Therefore, He will certainly make the hungry satisfied with good things. Brothers and sisters, has God brought us to this point? Have we ever felt that we cannot make it? Those who feel that they have nothing at all are blessed because they will certainly be filled. Only these persons can receive God's blessing; only these ones will be filled. If you think that you are rich and feel that you are good in everything, you can only expect to be sent away empty. Only one class of people will be filled before God: those who are empty in hand and empty in spirit. Brothers and sisters, are you truly empty? Have you really reached the point where God can bless you? Can you say, "I am useless in the service of God, and I can do nothing at all"? If you are truly empty and if you are truly seeking after God's word, He will work and operate in you.</p><h2 class="head1">FIVE</h2><p>The story in 2 Kings 4 shows us an important spiritual principle.</p><p>What did the woman and her sons have? They only had a pot of oil. This same pot of oil was later poured into many empty vessels. The little bit of oil that she had at the beginning was crucial. In the Bible oil represents the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit works only on those who already have the Spirit abiding in them.</p><p>The widow's problem was that she had too few vessels. Elisha told her, "Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbors, even empty vessels; borrow not a few. And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full" (2 Kings 4:3-4). What did the woman do? "So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out. And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed" (vv. 5-6). She had to borrow empty vessels&mdash;this speaks of the need for empty room within us for the Holy Spirit. She was to borrow not a few&mdash;this means the more the better. There should not be only one empty room but many empty rooms. One empty space is not enough; there needs to be many empty spaces. The more empty spaces there are, the more fullness there will be. This is a principle which the Lord has shown us: spiritual progress is a matter of being continually emptied out and continually filled up. The work of the Holy Spirit is not "once empty then forever full" but "always empty and always full." Therefore, brothers and sisters, do not think that as long as we have been emptied once, we will not need any more emptying. The work of the cross in us is ever-increasing and ever-deepening.</p><p>Another very important thing is the place where the oil was to be poured. It was to be poured in the house and with the door shut. To shut the door means to confine the woman, her sons, and the oil within the door. This indicates that we have to deal with the Holy Spirit directly ourselves. Everything should be between us and the Lord. Difficulties and victories are all personal. If there is something wrong with us, we must not bear a grudge against anyone nor blame anyone. We should shut the door, which means we should deal with the Holy Spirit within us alone. Our relationship is with the Holy Spirit alone. It is up to us and the Holy Spirit to decide whether we should live a rich spiritual life or a poor one. As long as we have settled everything with the Holy Spirit, all will go well.</p><p>We should consider another very precious thing: "And he [the son] said unto her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed." The Holy Spirit will fill every empty vessel, even the very last one. If there had been more empty vessels, there would have been more oil. We must bear in mind that the reason the oil stayed was because there were no more vessels. It was not the oil that first stayed, but the empty vessels that were first exhausted. When there were no more empty vessels, the oil stayed. The oil did not exhaust itself; it was the empty vessels that were exhausted. Brothers and sisters, God is waiting for us to empty ourselves. If there is an infinite emptiness in us, the Holy Spirit will grant us an infinite filling. Whether or not we will receive the blessing of the Holy Spirit depends on whether we have empty vessels. It depends on whether or not we have reserved room for the Holy Spirit and whether or not we have provided Him a place to work in us.</p><p>We need to pray and ask the Lord to dig more deeply in us and make more room in us so that the Holy Spirit can fill us. The filling of the Holy Spirit depends on our emptiness. I will repeat: our emptiness ought to be a continuous state. If we cannot empty ourselves, God cannot fill us. The Holy Spirit is waiting for empty rooms within us. The more empty rooms we give to Him, the more He will fill us. If there is empty room, it means there is more filling by the Holy Spirit to come. Therefore, we need not seek for the filling; all we have to do is to empty ourselves. The Holy Spirit alone is responsible for the filling; our responsibility is to empty ourselves. If we can empty ourselves, we will have the filling. We may not be conscious of the filling, but the fact of the filling will certainly be with us.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, God wants to fill the hungry with good things. If God has already created a seeking heart within us and if He is digging and emptying us, we ought to believe that He will certainly fill us. God will only send away empty those who think they are rich.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</h1><h1 class="title">SPIRITUAL PROGRESS</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Luke 14:26-27, 33</h1><p>Every Christian should have spiritual progress, but what is spiritual progress? How can one progress spiritually? What are the manifestations of a Christian making good spiritual progress? This is a big question, and we cannot cover everything here. We can merely treat it very briefly. According to the record of the Bible and the experience of the saints, spiritual progress is the increase of the element of God in us. God is Spirit, and if the Spirit of God dwells in us, we are in the spirit (Rom. 8:9). Spiritual progress is the increase of the element of God in us. Suppose the element of God was a hundred units at the time we were saved. If we have made any progress in spiritual matters, then the element of God has increased in us. If the element of God in us becomes two or three hundred units, it means that we have made some spiritual progress.</p><p>In the beginning when God created man, He made man His vessel. The eternal purpose of God is to enter into man, to mingle Himself with man so that man may be full of Him. The failure of Adam and Eve was that they did not allow God to fulfill this purpose. On the contrary, they were alienated from God. What does it mean to be alienated from God? It means that man does not yield the proper place within himself to God. What does it mean to not yield the proper place to God? It means certain things within have occupied a person's being. When Adam and Eve ate of the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, God's command did not occupy them; rather, they were occupied with how the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was good for food, how it was pleasing to the eyes, and how it enabled man to have wisdom. These usurped the place of God in them. As a result they fell. As long as there is one thing, one event, or one person that takes possession of you, you have fallen from the presence of God.</p><p>We should ask ourselves what our condition today is. From the day we were saved until now, how many things, events, and people are still occupying us and depriving God of His rightful place? We need to consider ourselves. Dear brothers and sisters, if God's Spirit opens our eyes a little from within, we will immediately see that many items within our whole being are occupying the place that belongs to God alone.</p><p>A brother once said that man's heart is like sticky gum; it sticks to anything that comes across its way, whether it is clothing or a table. Sometimes we are stuck to an easy life, and at other times, we are attached to personal ambition. Once we are attached to something, we cannot love God properly anymore. We attach ourselves not only to what we have, but also to what we do not have. We can become attached to our difficulty, imagination, or vainglory. No matter what our heart is attached to, as long as there is one thing usurping God's place in us, we have fallen. Whenever God's place in us is usurped, we become fallen people. A person may have been saved for ten years. During the first five years he may have done well, but during the next five years there was something in his heart usurping the place of God, and he became fallen. Although he continued to come to meetings, pray, and serve God, inwardly he has fallen. Brothers and sisters, God's goal is for man to become His vessel. As long as we are occupied by something other than God, and as long as we do not yield the proper place to God, we are fallen.</p><p>A brother may say that another brother loves his son too much and that his son has usurped God's place, but that his own son has not usurped God's place because his son is not that lovable. Actually, both are wrong. If your son is too lovable, he may usurp God's place. If he is not very lovable, he can also usurp God's place. You may fail to love God because your son is too lovable, and you may not love God because your son is not lovable. Whether or not something is occupying God's place in you is judged by whether you love God.</p><p>Therefore, it is very easy to find the meaning of spiritual progress and the ways and means to spiritual progress. We have mentioned the positive aspect of spiritual progress, which is the increase of the element of God in us. Now let us look at the negative aspect of spiritual progress. Spiritual progress on the negative side is the shedding of certain things from us, that is, from our inner being. As soon as something is shed from us, we have spiritual progress. When something that usurps God's place is shed from us, we have spiritual progress.</p><p>Suppose a person is preoccupied by his excessive talking. Every time you meet him, he incessantly talks like a chatter box that never shuts its lid. He never stops talking. If this man wants to make any spiritual progress, his excessive talking must be removed. Real progress for him will occur when his excessive talking stops. Spiritual progress is the increase of the element of God in us. It is also the removal of things other than God within us. We must not think that we can make progress by simply attending a meeting, hearing a message, or understanding a message. Spiritual progress for us is not only addition but also subtraction. Having eight or ten messages in us is not progress; it can well be a hindrance. Spiritual progress is the increase of the element of God and the removal of everything else. Brothers and sisters, what is spiritual progress? Is it listening to a few messages? No. When we listen to a message, the message reaches our mind, but this is not progress. When something is removed from us there is progress. If something is removed from us, we have progress. If God's element increases in us, we have progress.</p><p>Many Christians are delivered from the pleasures of sin as soon as they are saved. Yet it is not enough to be free from sin alone. Spiritual progress is being free from everything that usurps the place of God. Brothers and sisters, we must not only be clean but also pure; we should not be occupied by anything other than God. Whenever God's work removes something from us other than God, we have spiritual progress. We must continually ask ourselves whether we are shedding things. We must remember that if nothing is removed from us, we have no spiritual progress. If nothing has been cast off from us for a month or a year, we have had no progress during that month or year. Brothers and sisters, spiritual progress on the positive side means the increase of the element of God, and on the negative side, it means the decrease of ourselves. A Christian who makes great progress is one who decreases daily. Today he may see that vanity has no place in him, and he decreases. Two days later, he may see that pride has no place in him, and he decreases some more. After the fifth day, he may see that gossip has no place in him, and he decreases still more. After seven days, he may see that his impatience should not have any place in him, and he will decrease some more. Some people find it very difficult to remove the love of money from themselves. Others find it very difficult to remove their temper. Still others find it very difficult to remove their lethargy. Some things can only be dropped a little at a time. They may need ten years before they are completely dropped. This dropping is a kind of dying. Dying to money means dropping money; dying to temper means dropping our temper. On the positive side, spiritual progress means the increase of God's element within us. On the negative side, it means the dropping of many things from within us little by little.</p><p>How can these things be dropped? Simply put, the love of God first operates within a saved person. When this person is constrained by God's love, his heart turns towards God, and the Spirit of God is then given a chance to work and operate within him. When this happens, he is enlightened and sees something. Once he sees something, the Holy Spirit intensifies His work. The believer will obey the Spirit, and something will drop from him. One day God's love will inexplicably constrain you, and your heart will be turned to God, and you will say, "O God, I love You." When this happens, the Holy Spirit enlightens you. Once the Holy Spirit enlightens you, something is seen. Once you see something, the Holy Spirit intensifies His work, and you will immediately obey and say amen. This obedience results in something falling off. The degree to which things fall off will be the degree of your spiritual progress. The Lord said to the disciples, "Everyone of you who does not forsake all his own possessions cannot be My disciple" (Luke 14:33). Some people forsake all things, only to pick them up again shortly. When the Lord Jesus spoke of forsaking all, He meant for it to be accomplished by the Spirit in us. Consequently, the work of the cross can only be executed by the Holy Spirit in us, and only then will things drop off. How does the Holy Spirit execute the work of the cross? As long as our heart is open towards the Lord, the Spirit will execute the work of the cross in us. On the cross the Lord Jesus stripped away everything for us already. Now the execution of this stripping work by the Holy Spirit is based on the degree to which our heart is turned towards God.</p><p>We must reiterate that spiritual progress on the positive side is the increase of the element of God, and on the negative side it is the decrease of things usurping God's place. The extent of this decrease depends on the degree to which our heart is turned towards God. How we wish that something would be removed from us daily! This is dying daily. Whenever we do not find anything dropping off, our progress has stopped.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 8:32</h1><p>Nineteen hundred years ago, Pilate asked, "What is truth?" (John 18:38). Many people have also asked this question. We cannot explain the biblical meaning of truth according to our concept. We have to consider what truth is according to God's Word.</p><p>The word truth in Greek means "absolute reality." Hence, truth is not a theory but a reality. We do not know the theory behind many real things, yet we can touch the fact and the reality of them.</p><p>According to John 1:17, the law was given through Moses, while grace and reality came by Jesus Christ. Grace is not an attitude of God, but a work of God. Grace is the work that Jesus of Nazareth, the Son of God, has accomplished for us. God's Son has been crucified on the cross and shed His blood to accomplish God's work of redemption. There is no need for us to do anything by ourselves. By trusting in Him, we are saved. Without the work of the cross, God had no way to dispense His grace to man. Through Moses, He was only able to give man the law. Grace comes to us only because of the work of the cross. Therefore, grace is the work of God. Both grace and reality are in the same verse. Grace came through Jesus Christ, and reality also came through Jesus Christ. When God gave the world His only begotten Son, He intended that He be reality as much as grace. Through the work of His Son, there was grace. Through the work of His Son, there was also reality. Without the work of the Lord Jesus, there could not be grace today. The Lord Jesus had to accomplish grace before this grace could be dispensed to man; millions of Christians believe this. The Lord Jesus also had to accomplish the reality before this reality could be dispensed to man. Ephesians 4:21 says, "The reality is in Jesus." God has accomplished the truth in the Lord Jesus. The truth is in Him; it is His work.</p><p>The Lord Jesus said, "I am...the reality" (John 14:6). The truth mentioned in the Bible refers to nothing other than the reality. What is reality? It is what we really are before God as a result of the Lord Jesus' accomplished work. This is truth, and this is reality. The Lord Jesus has shed His blood to redeem all those who belong to Him. This is a fact. Because of Him, I am a redeemed person before the Lord. This is the truth. The truth is what I am as a result of the facts accomplished in the Lord Jesus. I can only have the truth through the work that the Lord Jesus has accomplished. If the Lord Jesus had not worked, I would not have any truth or any reality before the Lord. I was a dead man and a sinner before God; I did not have any standing or anything before Him. But now, thank the Lord, through the work of the Lord Jesus, I have the reality before God; I have gained something solid and real. This real and solid thing is the fact that I am now a redeemed person. We must remember that the truth mentioned in the Bible is not doctrines preached on a platform, but a fact before the Lord. A doctrine is man's explanation of something, while the truth is what we have become in the eyes of God through the accomplishments of the Lord Jesus. Through the work of the Lord Jesus, God has made me another person. This is a truth; it is a reality. We must remember that in God's eyes, the work of Jesus Christ is finished. The truth is what we have become as a result of this work. Truth is Christ; it is the Lord Jesus Himself because all the realities are in Christ. All the facts that we have been speaking of are in Christ. We can say that two plus two equaling four is a truth, but it is not the truth that we are speaking of here. The truth that we are speaking of here is just Christ Himself.</p><h2 class="head1">TRUTH SETTING US FREE</h2><p>Do we not have the truth already? Yes, but a question immediately arises. Why is there a vast difference in what we are before the Lord and what we are in the world? The work of the cross is finished, but we are still not victorious. The Lord Jesus has changed us into one kind of person, yet on earth we still appear as another kind of person. This means that our condition does not match the truth that we hold onto before God. This is our problem. We often do not know what the truth is. We come to God according to our own feelings and experiences rather than according to God's truth. We must realize that God's truth is contrary to our feelings and experiences. The one issue we have to resolve is which of the two is real. Is the Lord's accomplishment for us before God more real, or are our own feelings and experiences more real? Which of the two is more real? This is the question.</p><p>We are often bound because we do not see what is real, what is reality. Once we see the truth, the truth sets us free; it liberates us. Let us mention a few things to illustrate what it means for the truth to set us free.</p><p>We will begin with salvation. Suppose someone hears the gospel and realizes that the Lord Jesus has died on the cross and shed His blood to forgive his sins. He believes in the Son of God for the forgiveness of his sins, and he receives the Lord into him. When others ask whether he belongs to the Lord, he says, "Yes." He is bursting with joy within. However, three or five months later, he may feel a little sick, and troubles and difficulties may arise in his family. Then his joy is gone; it seems as if joy has departed far from him. He feels as if he is no longer saved and is no longer a child of God. If others ask him whether he is a Christian and whether he is saved, he may answer, "I am quite bothered. I have lost my former joy. I do not know where the Lord Jesus is anymore. I do not know what to say about this." What would you say to him at this time? If you know God's truth, you would tell him, "You may feel that you are not saved, but in fact you are saved. In reality you are saved."</p><p>From what side are you looking at the matter? If you look at it from his side, you may feel that he is not yet saved. But if you look at it from the side of the Lord's work, you will say, "Brother, there is no change; you are still saved. You are saved when you feel hot, and you are still saved when you feel cold. Your feeling may change, but the work the Lord has accomplished for you and what God has given you will never change. You have to look at it from His end." The Lord says, "You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free." When a man's eyes are opened to see that he has obtained reality and truth before God through the work of the Lord, he will be free and he will be liberated. We must remember that we are not freed according to our feeling. Only one thing frees us: the reality which is before God.</p><p>There was a brother who had definitely repented to the Lord and was a regenerated believer. After awhile, however, his inward feelings became different; he felt quite grievous, and he thought that he would surely perish. Another brother came along and said to him, "How do you know that you are going to perish?" He said, "I am not the same as before. I feel cold within. Neither my prayer nor my reading of the Bible is doing me any good." The other brother said, "That is the condition on your side, but let us consider a few questions from God's side. Has the work of the Lord Jesus been discounted?" "No." "Has the Lord's work changed from what it was before?" "No." "Has His work been annulled before God as if the new covenant were dissolved?" "No." "All right, we are sure that there is no change on His side. Therefore, according to truth and according to reality, you have not become unsaved before God. What has changed is your own feeling. You may feel that you are saved, and you may feel that you are not saved, but when God says that you are saved, will He change? You have to remember that salvation is a question of truth; it is not a question of feeling." When he heard this, he responded with tears, "It does not matter how confident I am; whatever I say or feel means nothing. If God says that I am saved, then I am saved." This is the truth setting us free. Spiritual reality liberates a man from his own feelings; it frees him.</p><p>Let us go one step further to see how the truth sets us free. God's Word shows us that when the Lord Jesus died on the cross, He bore our sins, regenerated us, and saved us. God's Word also shows us that when the Lord Jesus died on the cross, He put us into the Lord Jesus, and our old man was crucified with Him. The Lord's death was not the death of an individual; it was a corporate death. When He died on the cross, we died in Him also. Through His accomplishment, we became dead. This is truth, and this is reality.</p><p>However, before we see this truth, we are bound. When we look at ourselves, we still find our temper. When we touch our feelings, we still find our weaknesses. All the undesirable things we have from head to toe are still with us. The question now is: Are our experiences and feelings more real, or is the Lord's work more real? Many people are weeping as if nothing is more real than their bondage. But God's Word shows us that only one thing is real, that is, the accomplishments of His Son Jesus. Our old man is crucified with the Lord. This is truth. If we do not see this truth, we will become a slave to our temper and will be bound by our experience and feelings. What can set us free? Only the truth can set us free. Only reality can set us free. If we live by our feelings and experiences, we will fail again and again. But if we see the fact of our crucifixion with the Lord, we will be set free.</p><p>Let us consider another matter: the victory of the Lord Jesus. There was a brother who was under Satan's attacks for a few months in body and in mind. He tried all he could to pray and resist them. He even exhausted himself in prayer and resistance. Yet for three months straight, despite his resistance and prayer, he was still under the attack. One night he prayed to the Lord, "I cannot resist any longer. My power of resistance is exhausted. I cannot pray anymore, my strength to pray is gone. Lord, show me where the root of the problem lies." God opened his eyes and gave him a word. He had heard that word before, but when he had heard it previously, it was like seeing men as trees. Now he became clear. The word was: "Is Satan worth such resistance from us?" He had never before thought that one could be wrong for resisting Satan. On that day, he saw the reality. What is the reality? The reality is that the Lord Jesus has overcome. When we are joined to Him, we also overcome. It is not that the Lord Jesus is about to overcome, and we cheer Him on. The truth is that He has overcome. It is not that Satan will be defeated, and we pray for the Lord to defeat him. Thank and praise the Lord that Satan is already defeated. It is done; it is not something to be done. Once that brother saw this truth, the attacks stopped. Everything became quiet, and all the problems were over. This is the reality setting men free. This is the truth setting us free.</p><h2 class="head1">TRUTH AND LIGHT</h2><p>In order to see the truth, we need God's enlightening. Psalm 43:3 says, "Send forth Your light and Your truth." What is the purpose of God's light? It is for enlightening the truth. This is very important. We know God's truth through the light. Truth does not come from the preaching of the word; it comes from God's light. Today if you ask the brothers and sisters, "Have you died in Christ?", many will say, "I am dead. Yet I do not know why it is not producing any effect on me." This is because they have only heard the doctrine; they have not seen the truth. Whoever sees the reality has received the light. A brother said that when God opened his eyes to see Romans 6, he saw Ephesians 6 as well. He saw that his death was a fact, the Lord's victory was a fact, and his participation in the Lord's victory was also a fact. In the past, he was only hoping for it; now he knew that he had it. In the past he was only hoping that the Lord would overcome; now he could praise the Lord for having overcome. He testified that this way of living was totally different from his former way of living. Formerly, everything was in the way of yearning and hope. Now everything was reality. He was no longer trying to grasp onto something; everything was in his hands already. When the light comes, a person has to jump up and say, "It is finished!"</p><p>Every Christian has been enlightened at least once when he was saved. When a person is saved, he sees that he does not have to hope to be saved or hope to receive eternal life. He does not have to hope to receive these things in the future. Instead, he thanks and praises God for accomplishing all these things in Christ. Once the light shines on the truth, a person becomes a Christian. Every Christian becomes a Christian through the light shining on the truth. All spiritual realities come through the shining of the light upon the truth.</p><p>Therefore, when a truth is being preached without the accompanying shining of the light, it becomes a doctrine. When truth is preached, and God's light is upon it, the truth becomes revelation. To receive a revelation is to receive the truth. Those who receive a doctrine are merely filled with ideas in their mind. Only those who have received a revelation receive reality and life.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH AND THE WORD OF TRUTH</h2><p>When God's light shines, the Holy Spirit brings us into the spiritual reality of what the light shines on. On the one hand, there is the Spirit of truth; the Comforter is the Spirit of truth. On the other hand, there is the Bible, which is the word of truth. There are first the facts of truth&mdash;the things that God has accomplished in Christ. When the Bible tells us these facts of truth, and we believe in the words of truth, the Holy Spirit brings us into the truth itself, that is, into the spiritual reality itself. The Lord Jesus is the reality, and God brings us into the reality through His Spirit. In this way, we no longer have a doctrine or a theory; we do not have to live in our feelings or our experiences anymore; instead, we can live in Christ's accomplished facts.</p><p>Hence, the main question is whether or not we have revelation. When we have revelation, we will not think of our own experiences or our own feelings. We will believe that everything on God's side is real. Many Christians consider that their old man is still living, that it is a reality. They dare not believe that they were crucified with Christ. But if they see the revelation, they will change. The revelation will show them that their old man is surely and undeniably dead. We must remember that only those who receive the revelation of the Holy Spirit enter into the reality. The Holy Spirit gives us revelation and shows us what is real before we can ascertain what is real and what is not.</p><p>When God accomplishes something and we see what He has accomplished, we have the real experience. Praise and thank the Lord, when we see what God has accomplished and when we say yes to whatever God has said yes to, we have the real experience. May the Lord open our eyes to see the truth. If we truly see the truth, the truth will set us free. Our liberation comes from the truth. Our freedom comes from the truth. We should all seek after the truth, which means that we should all seek after reality. May God lead us into all reality.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">THE DIVIDING OF THE SOUL<br />FROM THE SPIRIT</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 4:12-13</h1><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>The dividing of the soul from the spirit is a very important thing. It has to do with the growth of the Christian life. If a Christian cannot tell the difference between the soul and the spirit, how can he seek after that which is spiritual? He will often take soulish things for spiritual things, always live a life in the soul, and not seek after that which is spiritual. God's Word mentions many times what the soul is like and what the spirit is like. The Bible mentions some people who grieve in the soul and some people who grieve in the spirit. It mentions some people who rejoice in the soul and some people who rejoice in the spirit. Some draw the conclusion from these verses that the spirit must be the same as the soul because they have similar functions. However, this is like saying that you are me since you can eat and I can eat. Hebrews 4:12 says, "For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit." Since the soul and the spirit can be divided from each other, it is clear that the spirit is the spirit and the soul is the soul.</p><p>Genesis 2 shows us that when God created man, He breathed the breath of life into his nostrils. When this breath of life came in contact with the human body, the soul was produced. Verse 7 speaks of man becoming a living soul. This means that the outstanding feature of man is his soul. The breath of life is the spirit of man; it came from God. The spirit has a God-consciousness; it responds to God's voice and is able to fellowship with God. But after Adam fell, his spirit became dead towards God. Thereafter, Adam's spirit (as well as his descendants' spirit) was dominated by the soul. In the end, the spirit and the soul were mixed together. At the time man is saved, his spirit becomes alive to God once more. Yet because of the long period of mixture with the soul, the spirit now needs God's word in order to be divided from the soul.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>Although the spirit and the soul are similar in function, they belong to two different realms. They have two different sources. You may be happy today, but your happiness may be from the soul or from the spirit. In both cases it is happiness, but there is a distinction between the places from which the happiness comes. You may be sad today, but your sadness may be from the soul or from the spirit. In both cases it is sadness, but there is a distinction between the places from which the sadness comes. God is concerned about the source from which a thing comes. For example, Abraham was about to beget a son. At that time he was very old, and there did not seem to be much hope. He waited for a long time without seeing God's promise being fulfilled. Then his wife came up with a plan; she suggested that Abraham marry Hagar. Eventually Ishmael was produced. Fourteen years later God gave him Isaac through his wife Sarah. If we only read Genesis 15&mdash;17 and 21, we will not know what Isaac and Ishmael represent. In Galatians 4, we find out what Isaac and Ishmael represent. Paul said that one was born according to promise, while the other was born according to flesh. Do we see the distinction here? Man thinks that as long as one has a son, everything is all right. But God asks where the son comes from. We think that as long as we have a son, be it an Isaac or an Ishmael, we will be satisfied. But God's Word says that Ishmael represents the flesh, while Isaac represents the spirit. Ishmael represents what man acquires through his own wisdom and strength, while Isaac represents what man receives from God and what is of God.</p><p>Then what does it mean to be soulish? Being soulish is doing things by the self. What does it mean to be spiritual? Being spiritual is doing things by God. These are two entirely different things. A person can do things without waiting on God and without trusting in Him. This is soulish and fleshly. He can also speak and move only when God tells him to speak and move, looking to God, waiting on Him, and trusting in Him. This is what it means to be spiritual. We have to ask whether everything we do is done in the Holy Spirit. This is a crucial question. We often do the right things, yet something within us still condemns them. We condemn them not because they are bad but because they do not originate from God and are not the result of the operation of the Holy Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>First Corinthians 3 mentions the matter of the building, which refers to one's work. Some build with gold, silver, and precious stones in their work, while others build with wood, grass, and stubble in their work. What kind of work is considered gold, silver, and precious stones, and what kind of work is considered wood, grass, and stubble? In the Bible, gold, silver, and precious stones refer to things that are of God. Gold represents glory, which comes from the Father. Silver represents redemption, which is the Son's work. Precious stones are compounds produced out of heat under the earth; they represent the work of the Holy Spirit. There is the eternal glory of God, the cross of the Son, and the edifying work of the Holy Spirit. This is the gold, the silver, and the precious stones. Wood, grass, and stubble refer to things that are of man. Man's glory is like grass, his nature like wood, and the result of his work like stubble. Hence, gold, silver, and precious stones symbolize things that are of God, while wood, grass, and stubble symbolize things that are of man. Gold, silver, and precious stones are not things that grow on the surface of the earth. One can only find these things by digging deep. Wood, grass, and stubble all grow on the surface of the earth and can be easily found. Hence, anything that is from the depths, conceived in the hidden parts, is part of God's work, while anything that the flesh accomplishes is of man and is not worth anything. Anything that one can do easily, that one can learn easily, rarely has any spiritual value because it originates from outside. Only things that issue from the depths, that are of God, have spiritual value.</p><p>This distinction exists in our preaching as well as in our evangelistic work. Some preach the gospel by waiting before God, looking to Him, and picking up a burden from Him. It seems as if their work is born out of an inward impregnation. This is the work of gold, silver, and precious stones. Others preach the gospel according to their quick mind, powerful eloquence, or sharp memory. The minute they stand up, they can speak. They may be very busy with their work, but before the Lord this work is wood, grass, and stubble; it does not have any spiritual value at all. A brother was preaching once in a certain place. Outwardly, in man's eyes, the situation was very encouraging, and he should have been rejoicing. Yet strangely, the more he worked, the less spirit he had. Outwardly, he appeared very energetic, but inwardly he became hungrier and hungrier, and dry and parched. When he was finished with his work, he had to confess his sins before the Lord. He had to confess that he was working by himself. Therefore, it is not a matter of outward condition; the matter of importance is who is doing the work.</p><p>This inward distinction has nothing to do with words spoken outwardly or results produced superficially. The only distinction lies in the source. Because of this distinction, some who pick up the same words and who speak the same messages as others just give everyone the impression that they are clever. Others who use the same words and speak the same messages give everyone the impression that they know God. When we meet some people, we can only bow our head and say, "God is here!" But when we meet other people, we can only say that they are clever and eloquent. If we have touched God, we can cause others to touch God. If we have touched the soul, all we can do is cause others to touch ourselves. The two things are entirely different.</p><h2 class="head1">FOUR</h2><p>This is true not only in our service to the Lord, but in our personal life as well. Once a Christian went to speak to a servant of God. He was afraid of being criticized; therefore, in his conversation he tried his best to be humble. He struggled to be humble in his attitude and in his speaking. But while he was practicing this humility, others felt a tremendous strain. If a man is genuinely humble, there is no place for such a great strain. This man was acting out his humility; therefore, his humility was so strenuous. Could one say that he was without humility? Others had to admit that there was some humility. But it was artificial humility. It was soulish. If God works in such a one, his humility will be very spontaneous. He will not feel that he is being humble, yet others will see God's work in him. Those who put cosmetics on their faces look in the mirror all the time, but Moses, whose face shone, did not see the shining himself. Some become what they are through the work of God within them. This is spiritual. Others are performing; they are struggling. As a result, they strive hard to be a Christian. Actually, one does not need to strive hard to be a Christian. For us, as long as the outward appearance is good, nothing else matters. But in God's eyes, the sources of two things may be entirely different; one may be of God, and the other may be of the energy of the flesh and may be an imitation. The more some endure, the more we feel sorry for them. Others, however, are not conscious at all that they are enduring, yet we have to bow down and say that God has done a marvelous work in them. We can tell that one is of God, and the other is of man. The distinction is not based on outward appearances, but on the source.</p><p>This does not mean that anything spontaneous is of the spirit; some things that belong to the natural life are quite spontaneous also. Some are born meek. But they will find one day that natural meekness and the meekness from the Lord are two entirely different things. Some are born with a love for others. But one day they will find that an inborn love is totally different from the love that comes from the Lord. Some are born humble. One day they will find that the humility from the Lord is absolutely different from the humility which they have in themselves. Natural virtues can replace spiritual things more readily than acquired imitations. One often replaces the Lord's work with man's natural endowments. Actually, anything that comes from the soul has nothing to do with God; only that which is from the spirit is related to God. The meekest one will find one day that he faces more temptation because of his natural meekness. One day his meekness will run out, and his endurance will run out. He can only endure to a certain extent, and he can only be meek to a certain extent. This is natural, and all human natural strength is limited. But if we apply the strength that comes from the Lord, the result will be entirely different. The Lord can do what we cannot do. We do not work by ourselves. The Lord works within us first, then we work spontaneously. After the work is over, we will marvel and say, "How did this happen? Who has done this?" We can only bow our heads and say: "I do not have any endurance. Lord, it is You who are doing the work within me." This is being spiritual.</p><h2 class="head1">FIVE</h2><p>Of course, we have to know that outwardly it is not easy to differentiate between the two things. It is not easy to tell within ourselves what is spiritual and what is soulish. The knowledge of the truth does not come from a daily self-examination; there is no spiritual value to constantly asking ourselves whether we are of the spirit or the soul. We cannot find the answer by asking or analyzing. We will not know it if we do not ask, and we will not know it even if we ask. We can never have genuine insight to any spiritual matter through self-analysis. On the contrary, this will only lead to spiritual paralysis and spiritual sickness. Genuine insight comes from God's shining. The minute the light shines, we spontaneously see. Therefore, we do not have to ask so much. All we have to do is allow God's word to shine within us. This word is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword. It is so sharp that it can pierce through bones. Once this word comes in, we will immediately know what is of the soul and what is of the spirit. There will be a judgment within which is stronger than any judgment from men. Once we move, something within will say, "This is wrong," "This is too shallow," or "You are working, and you are trying to influence others." This power of discernment comes from within and not from without. Once we see something within, the seeing becomes a genuine vision. Others may say, "If you do this, you may be exercising yourself." We may even nod our head, saying, "Perhaps it is the self." But none of these will help. The only thing that will help is seeing something in an inward way. May the Lord be gracious to us and grant us inward light, so that we have an inward seeing and an inward discernment. Discerning the spirit from the soul is the foundation of Christian discernment. We do not acquire this discerning power through a process of learning, but through inward enlightenment. Our hope before the Lord is that His word will come in, shine, and show us the part of our personal life and work that is soulish and the part that is spiritual.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</h1><h1 class="title">FEAR AND GODLINESS</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 25:12, 14; 2 Cor. 7:1; 1 Tim. 3:16; 4:7-9; Titus 2:12</h1><p>There are two words in the Bible which are quite familiar to us. One is fear, and the other is godliness. What do fearing and being godly mean? By the grace of God, we would like to share a little of what we have learned concerning these matters.</p><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>God demands that His children be holy. In 2 Corinthians 7:1, Paul said, "Therefore since we have these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and of spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God." This verse shows us that our holiness is very much related to our fear of God. God is holy, and the more we draw near to Him, the more we feel our uncleanness. The more we serve God, the more we fear ourselves. When we first learn to fear the Lord, it is natural that we fear the self-element in everything we do. For example, your son may come and ask what he should do. If you fear God, you will be afraid of the self-element in your answer. This is the meaning of fear. Suppose a brother asks you for help. If you fear God, you will be afraid of yourself in rendering help to your brother. But at the same time, you will also be afraid of yourself in refusing to help your brother. You are constantly in fear of yourself. This is the meaning of fear. In your acquaintance with the brothers and sisters, you may constantly be afraid of any mixture of the self. This attitude is called fear. To fear is to be afraid of the self in everything that you do. In criticizing or praising others, a person may have the fear that this criticism or praise comes from the self. Having a fearful heart is being afraid of the mixture of self-element.</p><p>Let me give a few more examples. Some brothers and sisters like to write letters. Under normal circumstances, writing letters is not wrong. But some brothers and sisters have a natural fondness for writing letters. They waste a considerable amount of valuable time in this matter. If we fear God, we will be afraid of our self even in writing letters. Any time we do something for ourselves, by ourselves, with our own goals in mind, for our own interest, and with the self in full view, we are not being fearful. Being fearful is being afraid of the self in everything and being concerned that we do not offend God in anything. This applies even to the way we deal with our children and with clothing and other necessities. We should be afraid that we have a self-element in the way we deal with our children and with clothing and other necessities, and we should be afraid of offending God in these matters. This apprehension concerning the self is proper fear. We may discover some fault in a brother and may want to rebuke him. But if we live before the Lord, the minute we set our mind on the matter, we will pray, "Lord, I am afraid of self-activity in rebuking my brother." This is the meaning of fear. However, if we are afraid of rebuking our brother just because we do not want to offend his feelings, this is not fear. To fear does not mean to be afraid of difficulties; it does not mean to be sensitive to human feelings. To fear means to be afraid of the activity of the self. The only thing we have to be afraid of is the self. Some people are worried about many things. They are worried about this and that. As a consequence, inexperienced ones say that they are very spiritual. But those who genuinely fear the Lord are not afraid of this and that. They are only afraid of one thing&mdash;the self; they are afraid of anything that may not be of God, through God, for God, or unto God. They are afraid of their self-element. This is the proper meaning of fear. Brothers and sisters, as we grow in life, we will not be afraid of many things. We will only be afraid of the self; we will be afraid of offending God. When some brothers and sisters find out something wrong with other brothers and sisters, their mind may try to come up with some clever ways to deal with the situation. Is this spiritual? We cannot say that this is spiritual. This is being political. Even if one succeeds, there will be no spiritual content or result to it. It is self when we deal with others in anger, and it is also self when we deal with others with smiles and subtlety. Brothers and sisters, our temper is not an expression of the fear of God, and our gentle tactics are not expressions of the fear of God. Being political is exercising the self. Anyone who is political is not being fearful of God. Those who fear God are afraid of the self not only when they lose their temper, but also when they deal with others in a gentle way. Our temper is often an expression of the self, and our gentle treatment of others is a greater expression of the self. In our gentleness we have not feared God. To fear is to maintain an attitude of apprehension about our self before God. The most precious attitude a man can have before the Lord is a fearful heart. This means that he is afraid of the presence of self within. This is being fearful.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>Then what is being godly? First Timothy 3:16 says, "And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh..." Godliness is God being manifested in the flesh. This means that God is expressed through man. God's life was manifested in the Lord Jesus (the Head of the church). In the same way, His life is manifested in those who believe in Him (the church). Hence, godliness is simply God's life in us being manifested through our flesh. If we are saved to the extent that our thoughts, words, actions, and attitudes no longer reflect our self but become the living of Christ, we are living a life of godliness. This is what God requires from us. He wants to extend the manifestation of God in the flesh through us.</p><p>Second Timothy 3:12 mentions "to live godly..." This means that we should be godly in our living, so that others will see God. The way we speak should make others feel the presence of God. The way we walk and act should make others feel the presence of God. Even our attire, the furniture in our house, the decor of our dwelling, and our whole living should give others the impression of God. When we contact others, they should sense God in us. This is being godly.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is hard to find even a few among a hundred Christians who live in a godly way. We often find many brothers and sisters who are ungirded in their loins and undisciplined in their mouths. They joke with each other and jest without having any feeling at all. They privately indulge in drinking and gambling without any sense of remorse within. This is because many so-called Christians do not know the meaning of godliness. Consequently, they do not have a godly living. Having the form of godliness, while denying its power, is vain. But one who has the power of godliness will surely not be void of the form of godliness. Godliness originates from God's life. The essence of God's life is godliness. When this life is manifested in us, the result is surely godliness. The trouble with man is that he is full of the self; he is still fleshly. As a result, the life of godliness is frustrated from expressing itself freely. If a Christian does not have any sense of godliness, he is either void of life or living in darkness. As long as a Christian is living in the light, he will always have consciousness within, although the degree of consciousness may vary. If he thinks, speaks, and acts according to an inward consciousness of godliness, he will become a godly man. This is why one has to exercise himself unto godliness.</p><p>First Timothy 4:7 says, "But the profane and old-womanish myths refuse, and exercise yourself unto godliness." This shows that the exercise of godliness is very related to the bridling of our words. Careless words are a sure sign of ungodliness. We should be living and fresh, but we must allow God to express Himself through our speaking. Titus 2:12 says, "Training us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts..." Godliness is not a question of the heart; it is a way of life. Godliness is God being manifested in us.</p><p>Let me repeat again. What is fear? It is a condition of the heart; it is being afraid of the presence of the self in everything and constantly being in fear of offending God. What is godliness? Godliness is a way of living; it is expressing God in our daily living. The principle of God's work is always from the inside to the outside. If a man only pays attention to the form of godliness without caring for the life of godliness, his conduct is just a performance without the power and reality of godliness. There is genuine godliness when a person, in a fearful way, becomes apprehensive of his self-activity and constantly refuses, opposes, and condemns all ungodly thoughts, words, acts, moves, and attitudes to the extent that he becomes restricted in his outward behavior. When he moves away from this restriction, he becomes uneasy within; he is condemned and no longer at peace within. We must learn to fear and exercise ourselves unto godliness. May the Lord have a way among us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE CONDITION OF OUR HEART</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 19:14; Acts 13:22-23</h1><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>Both of the above passages are related to David. Psalm 19:14 is a prayer of David, while Acts 13:22-23 is a description of David. In David's prayer, there are the "words of my mouth" and the "meditation of my heart," or the thoughts of the heart. He prayed that he would not only be kept in his words outwardly, but also be acceptable to God in his thoughts inwardly. The words of the mouth are an expression of the thoughts of the heart. The heart is the root problem. Whether or not one outwardly says the right words is not the basic problem. Whether or not one has an outward attitude in his speaking that is right is also not the basic problem. The thoughts of the heart are the basic problem. The thoughts of the heart constitute the root problem and cannot be overlooked. David did not merely pray, "God, may the words of my mouth be acceptable before You." He added to the prayer, "May the meditation of my heart be acceptable before You." David's prayer was for the thoughts of his heart to be acceptable before God. This is why Paul could later testify that David was a man according to the Lord's heart. A person who is according to God's heart allows God to touch his heart. If you will not allow God to touch your heart, it will be hard for you to be one who is according to His heart. Many Christians ask, "Why is it wrong for me to do this? Why is it wrong for me to say this? Why is it wrong for me to express myself this way?" Brothers and sisters, whether or not you are doing the right thing, saying the right thing, or expressing yourself the right way is not the real problem. Rather, is your heart right when you are doing such a thing, saying such a word, or expressing yourself in such a way? What is the condition of your heart? What is the condition of the root? Even if you are right in every outward thing, it is still possible for your heart to be wrong. God is touching the condition of your heart and asking about it. He allows many winds and waves to beat upon His children for this very reason. He uses these things to touch your heart and to expose the condition of your heart.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>The Bible shows us that David's life was characterized by the way of the cross. He lived a life of the cross. Two names are mentioned at the beginning of the New Testament: Abraham and David. These two persons ushered in the Lord Jesus; they brought God from heaven to earth. God needs to find someone like Abraham and someone like David before He can have a way to come from heaven to earth. We know that Abraham is the father of faith; his life was characterized by the way of faith. Only a way of faith can bring God down to earth. David's life was characterized by the way of the cross; he lived a life of the cross. He not only brought God to men, he also brought His rule among men. If you live in faith, you will afford God a way to come to man, and if you live under the cross, you will afford God a way to rule among men. If God's children are willing to take the way of the cross and live a life of the cross, God will rule among men in many ways. Brothers and sisters, in order for God to rule within, you must live the life of the cross. The characteristic of David's life is that he lived the life of the cross.</p><h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>David suffered many extraordinary experiences throughout his life. These experiences were there to test the condition of his heart. He was despised at home. When God told Samuel to anoint a son of Jesse to be king, Jesse gathered together his seven sons but forgot David (1 Sam. 16:6-13). Yet the heart of the young man was proper. His heart did not become improper through this experience. God told Samuel, "For man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart" (v. 7). God was pleased with David's heart. This is why he was chosen by God and used by Him.</p><p>After David killed Goliath, God put him in a situation where the women of Israel proclaimed, "Saul hath slain his thousands,/and David his ten thousands" (1 Sam. 18:7). One of these two sentences was a test to David, and the other was a test to Saul. Proverbs 27:21 says, "As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; / so is a man to his praise." Will you be proud when others praise you a little? Will you be jealous when others praise you less? The praises by the women of Israel tested David's heart as well as Saul's heart. David was not moved by the words, "David has slain his ten thousands," but Saul was provoked by the words, "Saul has slain his thousands." This word exposed Saul's jealousy (1 Sam. 18:6-9). Suppose you are engaged in some work with another brother. If another man comes along and praises your brother for his work, yet says nothing about you, how will you feel? Perhaps you will feel somewhat unhappy and displeased. This slight unhappiness and displeasure proves that you are not that clean inside. Did you not say with your mouth that you were doing this for God and not for yourself? Yet a word of praise from others provokes you. This proves that your heart is not all that clean. Every experience in our environment, particularly the way we are treated by those close to us, is a test to our heart. When David killed Goliath, all the hearts of Israel turned to him, yet Saul gave him a difficult time. During that long period of time, he submitted himself under God's hand and dared not walk away from God's hand. This shows how clean David was; his heart was right.</p><p>Later after David became king, he suffered a severe trial as the result of a great failure. His own son sought his life; Shimei cursed him and cast stones at him. What did he say? His heart was crystal clear that the Lord had bidden Shimei to come, and he looked to God for his good (2 Sam. 16:5-12). Do not think that negative circumstances will harm us. If our heart is not right, they will harm us. If our heart is right, they will do us good. Our circumstances expose our heart's condition. David lived a life under the cross, and this life revealed his heart's condition.</p><h2 class="head1">FOUR</h2><p>Brothers and sisters, we have to be careful about our words and our attitude, but we have to be more careful about the thoughts of our heart. Sometimes what we do outwardly does not necessarily reflect the condition of our heart. Only our inner feelings reflect the true condition of our heart. It is useless to merely guard our mouth because if the heart is not right, it will find the opportunity to express itself sooner or later. Brothers and sisters, our idle talk about others exposes our heart's condition. The more our heart is for God, and the more it seeks after Him in a pure way, the less we will have idle talk. Every time we gossip and murmur against others, it is a sign that our heart is not right. A heart that is single towards God will not have too many idle comments concerning others.</p><p>A brother once said, "If a `little brother' offends me, I can forgive him. But if a `big brother' offends me, I cannot forgive him." Another brother who was listening to him nodded his head unceasingly and fixed his eyes on his heart. The second brother was indicating, "Your heart! Your heart! If a `little brother' offends you, you can forgive him, but if a `big brother' offends you, you cannot forgive him. This exposes your heart. To forgive a `little brother' when he has offended you does not expose your heart. But when a `big brother' offends you and you cannot forgive, this exposes your heart." The presence of an offending `big brother' exposes the unforgiving heart. An object may not burn when it is lit with a match, but when it is thrown into the furnace, it will burn. This means that the object is not really incombustible. A `little brother' was not big enough to expose the heart of the brother, but a slight touch from the `big brother' exposes his heart. Brothers and sisters, do not complain about your wife or your husband. Do not complain about your parents or your children. They may be a matchstick, or they may be a furnace, but they are there to expose your heart. You should thank the Lord for them.</p><p>Dear brothers and sisters, if our heart is right, no one can shake us, and our heart will always be looking to God. David was according to the Lord's heart because his heart was after God no matter where the Lord put him. He did not have anything to do directly with men; he was related directly to God. He received everything from God's hand, and he viewed everything from God's eyes. Again I repeat that God uses our circumstances to test our heart. Brothers and sisters, may we pray the same prayer as the psalmist: "May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart/Be acceptable before You,/O Jehovah, my rock and my Redeemer."</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">GOD NEEDING MAN</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Isa. 6:8; 1 Sam. 1:10-11; John 7:17</h1><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>The Bible shows us that God needs man. God needs man to cooperate with Him before He can fulfill His eternal plan. In the six days of creation, man was the center of God's creating work. God could only rest after He had created man; He could not rest without man. Although man later fell, God's intention concerning man has not changed. He still wants to gain man. Man's salvation, edification, and maturity in spiritual life is for the satisfaction of God's need. The greatest necessity in God's work is human cooperation. At no time and place has God's work been carried out without human cooperation. Man works together with God, and God cannot do anything without man. (The work of God here does not include His work of creation in the six days. The work of creation in the six days was God's own work, and man had no part in it.)</p><p>From Genesis to Revelation, we can see that God has always been seeking man, gaining man, guiding man, and working through man. In order to do anything, God first gains some men. If He has not gained some men, He cannot work. We can see this from a few examples.</p><p>Consider the story of Noah and the ark. At the time of Noah, God clearly wanted to save men. But if He did not gain Noah, He could not fulfill His purpose. God had to find Noah, work through him, and accomplish His will by means of him. God wanted an ark, but He also had to find a person who had a heart for Him. God had to find a person who could cooperate with Him before He could build an ark. He had to find Noah, who sympathized with Him, walked with Him, and received His commission before He could accomplish His work. God had to gain man before He could do anything. In order for the story of the ark to be written, God had to first secure Noah. In him we see a man walking with God and working with Him.</p><p>Consider the story of Moses. God intended to deliver the children of Israel from the hand of Pharaoh, but He first had to gain Moses. Without Moses, God had no way to save the Israelites. It is true that God is omnipotent and almighty. But if He did not have Moses, it would have been impossible for Him to deliver the Israelites. If Moses had not allowed God to use him, God could only have waited until someone was raised up and then use this one to deliver the Israelites. In Moses' deliverance of the children of Israel, we also see God's need for man's cooperation. The principle here is very clear.</p><p>After the Israelites reached the foot of Mount Sinai, God ordered them to make a tent. He intended to fill the tabernacle with His glory and dwell among men through the tabernacle. Yet He needed a group of men to build the tabernacle. If God had not found Moses and a group of people to build the tabernacle, He could not have revealed Himself to the Israelites or dwelt among men.</p><p>In the coming of the Lord Jesus, we have a clearer picture of man's cooperation with God. Who is our Lord Jesus? He is God becoming a man. There was no one in the universe who could meet God's standard. As a result God Himself became a man. The Lord Jesus was more than a man, yet throughout His life on earth, He always maintained His stand as a man. Although He is God and the Son of God, He always did things as a man. When He was tempted, Satan told Him more than once that He ought to do things as the Son of God. Satan tried to lure Him away from the position of a man to the position of God. But the Lord Jesus answered, "Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God" (Matt. 4:4). He meant that He was on earth as a man. He was tempted by Satan because He became flesh and was made a Nazarene. When He cast out a demon, the demon cried, "I know who You are&mdash;the Holy One of God." But the Lord silenced him (Mark 1:23-26). The main purpose of the Lord coming to the earth was to be a man. He said, "For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost" (Luke 19:10). When Nathanael came to the Lord, he said, "Rabbi, You are the Son of God; You are the King of Israel." The Lord answered and said, "You shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man" (John 1:49-51). He always said the Son of Man did such and such. This shows that while the Lord Jesus was on earth, He always stood in the position of a man. God can only accomplish His work through man. When man could not satisfy God's demand, He sent His beloved Son to earth to become a man, to satisfy His own demand, and to accomplish His work. Later, we see the Lord Jesus sending the twelve and then sending the seventy (Luke 9:1-2; 10:1). In order to accomplish His work, God needs a group of men. All of God's work among men from Genesis to Revelation requires the cooperation of man. Without man, God can do nothing, and His work cannot be accomplished.</p><p>In Isaiah 6:8 God said, "Whom shall I send? Who will go for Us?" God has the desire to spread the gospel and save some men, but there is no one whom He can use. Some people are occupied by vainglory. Others are occupied by enjoyment, families, or ease. These ones only care for their own affairs, and they have no heart for the propagation of the gospel or for God's work. Brothers and sisters, do you realize that many people are not saved because of your refusal to cooperate with Him, rather than any unwillingness on God's part? God has the desire to save, but you have no desire to cooperate with Him. If every brother and sister was willing to cooperate with God, the number of saved ones would be beyond your ability to calculate. God's work cannot go on because He has not found men. Brothers and sisters, God must gain you before He can accomplish His work.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>There is a very precious thought in the Bible: God treasures man's aspiration for Him. The story of Moses shows us that he had an aspiration to save the Israelites on God's behalf. Although he was not used by God until he was eighty years old, his aspiration did not begin at the age of eighty; it was there when he was forty years old. God did not forget his aspiration during the next forty years. He came back to Moses.</p><p>Not only do we see this in Moses, we see this in the story of Samuel as well. Hannah prayed to the Lord and vowed, "If thou wilt...give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life" (1 Sam. 1:10-11). God gained Samuel and accomplished His purpose through him in that age because Samuel's mother had an aspiration toward God concerning her son. God cares for man's aspiration toward Him; He treasures such an aspiration.</p><p>If we read God's Word carefully, we will find that God only gives spiritual life and light to one kind of people. Who are these people? They are the ones who have an aspiration to be used by God. The same is true in the case of spiritual power. No spiritual power is outward. All spiritual power comes as a result of man's aspiration for God and his consecration to God. Genuine power is based on man's heart toward God and his love for God. In the Old Testament Samson was very powerful. His enemy, the Philistines, did not know the source of his power; through Delilah they found out that his strength was with his hair. Once his hair was cut, he lost his power (Judg. 16:15-17). What was his hair? It was the hair of a Nazarite. A Nazarite is one who is fully consecrated to God. All genuine spiritual power comes from one's consecration to God. If a person is not thorough with his consecration, he is still crippled and powerless. But if a person has a thorough consecration before the Lord, he will become powerful. No matter how seeking we have been, we must always remember that power comes from consecration.</p><p>Suppose God puts His hand on a sister, and she struggles with the Lord for a long time without yielding to Him. Although she is willing to pray with others, her condition is not healthy because she has not satisfied God's demand. No matter how much she tries to help others, she cannot have a breakthrough. One day when God's love constrains her, she decides tearfully to yield to God. Once she answers God's demand, the help she renders to others will begin to touch others. This is why we say that power comes from consecration. The more consecration we have, the more power God will give to us.</p><p>Some may ask: "Why is it that others can have the light, but I do not have the light?" According to the story of Samson, whenever his hair was shaved, his power was gone, and he lost his eyes (Judg. 16:20-21). We do not have the light and we are blind because we do not have a thorough consecration. The Lord said, "For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. The lamp of the body is the eye....But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be dark. If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!" (Matt. 6:21-23). The degree to which our heart is turned to the Lord determines the degree to which our spiritual eyes are opened within. God's children do not have light because they do not have a heart for God. They do not have power because their consecration is too little. When our heart is not turned to God sufficiently, when our consecration is inadequate, and when we do not answer God's demand completely, God cannot get through in us. If our consecration is thorough, it will bring in spiritual riches and heavenly blessings. I believe that when all the brothers and sisters are for the Lord and are thoroughly consecrated, the gospel will be preached everywhere and heavenly blessings will pour down everywhere.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, there is no other way to genuine power, light, and heavenly riches except through answering God's demand. The amount of consecration we have to God determines the amount of power we have from God. May we not hinder Him. In order for God to have a way, our heart must be turned toward Him; we must answer His demand and allow Him to flow through us. Otherwise, we will only hinder our God. God desires that we turn our heart to Him and answer His demand. In His work God needs man. If we do not answer His demand, He will have to find someone else to answer Him and carry out His will. May God strengthen our aspiration toward Him, and may His will be carried out through us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</h1><h1 class="title">LEARNING BY WORKING</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 25:19-23</h1><p>We must understand that in the spiritual realm, "time" works for "eternity." Our service in time is to prepare us for eternity. God has put us in time in order to train us and make us useful for eternity. Time is like a school; it is a place where we receive spiritual training and education. Our spiritual training and education in time will make us useful to God in eternity. This is why we say that our service in time is a preparation for our service in eternity.</p><p>According to Matthew 25, when the Lord comes back, He will say to the faithful slaves, "You were faithful over a few things; I will set you over many things" (v. 21). If we learn our lesson well, the Lord will entrust us with greater works when He comes back. Today is the time for us to learn; our proper service does not begin until the Lord comes back. Some brothers and sisters may think that the time for proper service is in the kingdom and not in eternity. However, Revelation 22 tells us that we will serve God in eternity (v. 3). God places us among His children today in order for us to serve together with all of them. I say again: Our service in time today is a preparation for our service in eternity.</p><p>On the day that we were saved, the Lord put His life within us. Thereafter, He has been training us step-by-step by means of specific instances, so that we would learn to cooperate with God and be mingled with Him. God wants to mingle His nature into man and make man useful in His hand. The measure of God in us is the measure of usefulness we have before Him. When the measure of God increases, our usefulness also increases. His measure does not increase merely through studying the Bible and prayer; He mingles Himself into us through the things we do. All spiritual usefulness comes from God's life being mingled into us. In fact, our usefulness before God is nothing other than the result of the mingling of His nature within us; that which is mingled into us becomes our spiritual usefulness. When God mingles Himself into us, the expression of such a life becomes our usefulness.</p><p>Hence, we must see that God's only goal in time is to dispense His element into us day by day. We have too much of our self-element within us, and God cannot shine through us. But as time goes by, God shines forth a little more. After a while, we will see more of God shining forth. At the end of many years, we will see God shining almost fully out of us. God is using time to mingle Himself into us. This mingling determines our usefulness. Time is the period during which we learn the lesson; it is not the period for our proper service yet. Today is the time of learning and internship. God has placed many souls before us for our learning. He has placed many brothers and sisters before us for our learning. We are continually learning before the Lord. This is why we should not have any opinion or ways of our own. Our service is not aimless, but we must learn to work together with all of God's children. The trouble is that some want to work and do not want to learn, while others want to learn and do not want to work. But we have to combine these two. We have to work by learning and learn by working.</p><p>What should we pay attention to in our spiritual learning? In the Gospels, Peter followed the Lord for three years. Was he working or was he learning during that period of time? He was learning while working. What was he learning? The one thing the Lord helped Peter to learn was to realize that God was dispensing His nature into man. The lesson Peter had to learn was to be delivered from his own thoughts into the Lord's thought. Although the Gospels do not say it this way, the picture is there. Let us now consider the story of Peter a little.</p><p>In Matthew 16 when the Lord Jesus "began to show to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed" (v. 21), Peter took Him aside and rebuked Him, saying, "God be merciful to You, Lord! This shall by no means happen to You!" (v. 22). The Lord said, "Get behind Me, Satan!..you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men" (v. 23). Following this He said, "If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me" (v. 24). What is the "self," and where is it hiding? From this portion of the Scripture, we see that the "self" is hidden behind man's opinion. Some may say that Peter was good and that he loved the Lord, but the Lord said that he was Satan and that he was setting his mind on the things of men. The Lord showed us in this verse that the self is hidden behind man's opinion; Satan always expresses himself through man's self. In order to deal with Satan, one must deny the self. The Lord was dealing with Peter and showing him that in serving the Lord, one must be delivered out of man's thoughts into God's thoughts. God's thought was for the Lord Jesus to die in Jerusalem. Peter's way of loving the Lord was just to mind the things of men. Brothers and sisters, do not think that as long as we love the Lord a little and serve Him a little, everything is fine. Even our love for the Lord may sometimes be something of men. Much of our service does not count in the eyes of the Lord; some of it He even reproves. We must set our mind on the things of God and not on the things of men. This is the lesson which the Lord wants us to learn. If we can be delivered from man's thought into God's thought, we have learned something.</p><p>Matthew 17 records the Lord's transfiguration on the mount. There Peter's thought appeared again. He said, "Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You are willing, I will make three tents here, one for You and one for Moses and one for Elijah" (v. 4). Who told him to make three tents? Peter's own thought crept in again. The minute he said this, God spoke. He said, "This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I have found My delight. Hear Him!" (v. 5). Only the Lord Jesus is God's beloved Son. God has no intention to lift Moses and Elijah to the same level to which He had lifted His beloved Son. He said, "Hear Him!" This means do not hear the law, which is related to Moses, nor the prophets, which are related to Elijah, but from now on, hear Him!</p><p>Did Peter ever say anything right in the Gospels? Yes, he did. Once he said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." The Lord responded by saying, "Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens" (Matt. 16:16-17). Shortly after, in verse 22, Peter said, "God be merciful to You." This shows that Peter could never say anything right by himself. He spoke a right word earlier, but that word was of God. We must realize that all human opinions and views are useless in the spiritual realm.</p><p>In Matthew 26, Peter went through another dealing. On the night the Lord was betrayed, He said, "You will all be stumbled because of Me this night, for it is written, `I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered'" (v. 31). But Peter said, "If all will be stumbled because of You, I will never be stumbled" (v. 33). This was Peter's self again. In his own eyes, he felt that he was very strong and different from everyone else. But he could not withstand even one question from a maid; he failed immediately. God exposed Peter's self through the circumstances, and He dealt with it.</p><p>When we read Acts 1, we see a different Peter than the one in the Gospels. One could say that he was delivered from the self by then. He understood the Scriptures, he understood prophecy, and he had his mind set on the things of God. Although he failed again later, he had almost learned his lesson.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, if you want to serve the Lord, you have to learn to be delivered from your own thoughts. Otherwise, you will not be of much use in God's hand. All service is a matter of God coming into you and coming out of you. When God comes into you and comes out of you, that is service. If you are not a person who allows God to come in and then out of you, others will only touch your mind; they will not touch God. If we are so set in our own opinions, others will not touch God. If we want others to touch God, we have to learn to be delivered from our own opinions. Some brothers and sisters have to learn to be delivered from their own opinions even in their prayers. If we are delivered from our own thoughts into God's thoughts, we will learn a genuine lesson and we will have genuine service. We will be able not only to walk with the Lord in time and reign with Him in the kingdom but also even to render Him better service in eternity. May the Lord be merciful to us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY</h1><h1 class="title">SERVING GOD IN THE SPIRIT</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 4:23-24; Rom. 1:9; 8:6</h1><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>Among God's children, there are many who have a strong desire to serve the Lord yet who regretfully have not found the proper way to serve Him. They are not off in doctrine, and they are not wrong in their conduct. They are wrong in the way they serve the Lord. What does this mean? What is the problem? The question that faces us is whether our service issues from our mind or from our inner being. Every service among God's children should issue from their inner feeling. (This inner feeling does not refer to the feelings of the soul but the feelings of the spirit.) Be it prayer, studying the Bible, preaching, or any spiritual pursuit, everything has to issue from one's inner feeling. Even our knowledge of ourselves must be based on our inner feeling. If our life and work issue from our mind, we are at a dead end as far as our spiritual progress is concerned. We may use our mind in ordinary affairs, but in our service to God, we must use our spirit. In spiritual matters, the first thing we have to do is act according to the feeling of our spirit; the function of our mind comes later.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>We cannot serve God according to our mind. We must serve Him according to our inner feeling. This is not just a matter of doing the right thing but of having the right source. Preaching, prayer, and Bible study are all right things. But if we preach, pray, and study according to our mind, we are doing the right thing with the wrong source. Our way is the wrong way. Brothers and sisters, we should follow our inner feeling to pray. We should follow our inner feeling to read the Bible. We should follow our inner feeling to preach the gospel and teach the truth. The most precious thing among God's children is the ability to live and work according to our inner feeling. We may have shortcomings, but as long as the source is right and the way is right, eventually we will be trimmed and become acceptable to God. Therefore, we first have to be concerned with the source of the things, not the things themselves. It is not a question of what we do, but by what source we do them. All our service to God should originate from the spirit.</p><p>It is all right for us to engage in academic study with our mind. But in order to contact God and touch Him, the mind is the wrong organ to use. We contact God with our spirit. For example, if we touch an electrical current with a piece of wood, no electricity will come through. But if we touch it with a piece of wire, immediately there will be an electrical current. If our prayer, Bible reading, gospel preaching, and truth teaching is the same as touching an electrical current with a wooden stick, nothing will happen because we are using the wrong means. In every spiritual matter, we have to look to God and sense the feeling He puts within us in our spirit. We should be concerned only with this. If our head starts spinning and our judgment springs from our mind whenever we encounter a spiritual problem, we have no spiritual value before God. Brothers and sisters, there are two ways. One is the way of the mind, and the other is the way of the inner feeling. The way of the mind will never make others touch God. Only the way of the inner feeling will make others touch God. When we stand up among the brothers and sisters to say something, we must be careful not to initiate anything from our mind. Before we stand up, we should ask God to cleanse all of our defilement with His Son's blood and ask for His anointing. We should say whatever our inner feeling directs us to say. Even if the words are faltering and perhaps incoherent, others will still receive the benefit. But if our speaking comes only from our mind, nothing will avail even when it follows a very logical sequence.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, spiritual things are carried out according to the inner feeling. When you kneel down by your bed to pray according to the utterance that is in your inner being, the more you pray the more you will touch God. While you are praying in this way, your mind may suddenly turn to a different direction, and you will not be able to go on with your prayer anymore; the utterance will stop. When you pray in spirit and in truth, it is like touching an electrical current with a wire; electricity will pass through it. But when you pray with your mind, it will be like touching an electrical current with a piece of wood; nothing will happen. A spiritual man is one who touches spiritual things with his spirit and who exercises his spirit to touch God. In the eyes of God, a fallen man is one who walks, speaks, and acts according to what he thinks.</p><p>Whenever something happens, the first thing you should do is to find out where you are. Are you in your mind, or are you living by the feeling in your spirit? You may ponder in your mind that you will move if things turn out to your advantage and stop if things do not turn out to your advantage. In the eyes of man, you may be very smart. However, the question is not whether you should do this but what is your source. If you find your mind spinning around like an electric fan or running madly like an unbridled horse, you can be sure that you are wrong. You must first ask God to bridle your thoughts, and then you must listen to what your spirit has to say. If your spirit feels that something is right, it does not matter whether you are unable to explain what has happened. But if your spirit feels that something is wrong, it will not work even if you can convince yourself that it is right.</p><p>Suppose two brothers who are having an argument go to another brother for arbitration. If the arbitrating brother lives in his mind, he will only concentrate on the arguments put forward by the two, and it will be easy for him to complicate the matter with his own emotions, likes, and dislikes. After listening to the case, he may say that one is right and the other is wrong; however, the judgment has been based on reasoning. Brothers and sisters, a Christian who lives according to his mind always lives in the realm of reasoning even though the reasoning he has may not even be correct. He argues because of his reasoning, and he make judgments according to his reasoning. As a consequence, those who reason will reason more, and those who disagree will disagree more. Two brothers argue because they have fallen into their reasoning. If another brother prays for God to turn him from his mind to his spirit and sense his spirit, he will help the other two and turn them from their reasoning. We must realize that our thoughts bring in our reasoning, and our reasoning easily convinces our emotion and flesh. Once a man touches his mind, he touches his emotion, and once he touches his emotion, his flesh is provoked. If we do this, we will not help our brothers; on the contrary, we will damage them. We must learn the proper lesson. May the Lord be merciful to us and save us into our spirit, so that we can sense what to do or say with our spirit. Only then will we be able to help others, and only then will we solve the problems of others.</p><h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>Finally, I will mention two things. First, if we desire to learn to live before God in this way, we have to learn the dealing of the cross. The cross deals with our natural life, our natural thoughts, and our natural emotions. If our natural thoughts and emotions are not dealt with, it will be difficult for us to live in the spirit. When something happens, and we confront it with our mind or emotion, we usually say, "How can this be!" This shows that we are living by our reasons. If we live by our reasons, surely we are living in our mind. Those who live in their mind invariably live according to the impulse of their emotions. If we live in the spirit, we will not reason according to opinions or speak according to emotions. Those who are under the control of God's Spirit have experienced the dealing of the cross.</p><p>The second point is the cleansing of the blood. In order to learn to live according to the sense in the spirit you must trust in the cleansing of the blood all the time. The more you are cleansed by the blood, the more you will shine. If some defilement in you has not yet been dealt with by the blood, you will be dull and dark. You must allow the blood to cleanse you. Only then will you have light.</p><p>These two things&mdash;the dealing of the cross and the cleansing of the blood&mdash;are necessary lessons for those who aspire to serve the Lord. A Christian does not live in the spirit primarily because his mind and emotion have not yet been dealt with and because his defilement has not been cleansed by the blood. As a result, he becomes a foolish Christian, one who never allows God to turn him to his spiritual senses. We must pay attention to the dealing of the cross and the cleansing of the blood. Then we will realize how much we have lived in the mind and how much we have ignored the senses in our spirit.</p><p>Some may say, "I do not have any inner feeling." Let me say this: If a person does not have any inner feeling, he is probably not yet regenerated. If he is regenerated, God's Spirit has surely enlivened his spirit, and he will surely have inner feelings. Even though he may be regenerated, there may be some kind of sickness within him; a sick man sometimes loses his feelings. When this happens, he will need the dealing of the cross and the cleansing of the blood.</p><p>A person who lives in the spirit is acceptable to God. May the Lord be gracious to us. May He guide us and lead us to live according to the sense in our spirit so that we can serve Him in the spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">GOD'S WILL AND MAN'S WISH</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 15:7</h1><p>God's children need to know God's will, and they should know His will. It is not right for us to be ignorant of His will. Our Lord said, "He who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness" (John 8:12). This means that those who follow the Lord will have light; they will see and they will know. In other words, if a man does not have light and if he does not see anything or know anything, it means that he is not following the Lord. We must be very careful before the Lord. Whenever we do not see, it means that there is a problem with our following the Lord.</p><p>However, the problem with some people is not that they do not want to do God's will but that they do not know God's will. The matter of knowing God's will is a big subject among God's children. Those who zealously seek after the Lord surely want to please Him and carry out His will in everything. In every move that they make, they ask whether it is God's will. This kind of desire and attitude is good and correct, but this is quite confusing to many people. On the one hand, they want to do God's will, but on the other hand, they do not know God's will. They feel guilty about everything they do, yet they feel equally guilty if they do not do anything. It seems as if God's will is so far away that they do not know how to obey it. For this reason, we want to consider the matter of understanding God's will.</p><p>It is true that God's will is objective and that it is on the throne. We must seek after it before we can understand. We often need to fast, pray, and wait in His presence a great deal before we can understand His will. In order to know His will, we must also drop our own will and deny the activity of the flesh. These are very important, but I will not speak about them now. I would like to briefly mention another aspect, which is the fact that God's will is revealed many times through man's wishes. Let us consider how man's wishes are related to God's will.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ACTIVE WISHING IN THE WILL</h2><p>John 15:7 says, "Ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you." The word "will" here in Greek means an active wishing in the will. According to this verse, when our will actively wishes something by asking, it shall be done for us. Some may ask, "What happens if this asking is not according to God's will?" They seem to be more careful than the Lord Jesus in His wording. They would rather say, "If it is according to God's will, and you ask by actively wishing, it shall be done for you." Yet our Lord said, "Ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you." In other words, the Lord trusts some people to wish according to God's will. This is why He can say, "Ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you."</p><p>Paul said the same thing in 1 Corinthians 10:27, "If any of the unbelievers invites you and you wish to go, eat everything that is set before you, asking no question for conscience' sake." It is interesting that Paul did not mention God's will here. He only mentioned man's wish.</p><p>Do the above two passages mean that man can act any way that he pleases? Does it mean that man can do anything that he wishes? No, these words are not for everyone; they are for Christians, those who are regenerated, who have the mind of Christ, who have been dealt with by the cross, who abide in the Lord, and in whom the Lord's word abides. Let us consider the subject under two separate points.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MIND OF CHRIST</h2><p>Paul said, "For who has known the mind of the Lord and will instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ" (1 Cor. 2:16). The will of God is objective, whereas the mind of Christ is subjective. The will of God is on the throne, whereas the mind of Christ is within us. The will of God is outside of us, whereas the mind of Christ is inside us, continually revealing His will to us. Once we are regenerated, God's life is clearly planted into us, and we have the mind of Christ. The minute we receive life, we receive the mind of Christ as well, which gives us new thoughts, new inclinations, and new wishes.</p><h2 class="head1">ABIDING IN CHRIST AND HIS WORD ABIDING IN US</h2><p>The Lord Jesus said, "If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you" (John 15:7). As a result of abiding in the Lord and His word abiding in us, whatever we will, that is, whatever we actively wish and whatever our will reaches for, we need only ask for, and it shall be done for us. The important thing, however, is the expression "if you abide in Me and My words abide in you." Only this kind of people have reliable wills, and only they will not have a problem with God's will.</p><p>If a man has life, if he abides in the Lord, and if His word abides in him, he will know what God wants and also what God does not want. In other words, he will not only be regenerated, but also be in constant fellowship with the Lord; he will only want what God wants. Here we immediately see the cross. There are those who have passed through the cross, who have been dealt with by the Lord; they abide in the Lord, and the Lord's word abides in them. The Lord's word is living in them. To these ones the Lord says, "Ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you." Therefore, the problem does not lie in God's will but in the kind of persons we are.</p><p>We can say that some Christians have reached the stage where God can trust them. They abide in the Lord and the Lord's words abide in them to the extent that the Lord trusts their will. He trusts that the wishes emanating from their will are according to God's will. This is why the Lord said, "Ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you."</p><h2 class="head1">THE BELIEVERS' EXPERIENCE</h2><p>Some may say, "How can God's will be that simple?" Brothers and sisters, I am not saying that God's will can be understood without pursuing it. I am saying that God's will is in us also; it is in us together with His life. This word is not for everyone but for those who are regenerated, who have the mind of Christ, and who know in a serious way the meaning of abiding in the Lord and having the Lord's word abide in them. Their will is the will of God. If they wish to have something, God will want it too. If they want something which is contrary to what God wants, they will feel like a deflated tire within. There will be no response within, and they will not be able to pray at all. If it is a wish that they cannot justify in themselves, can it be something that God wants? One day, when all of our self-motives are removed, our will will be one with God's will. When we will, God will will, and when we do not will, God will not will.</p><p>Romans 14:23 says, "All that is not out of faith is sin." This is the principle of the Christian life. The faith mentioned here is different from the faith mentioned in other places in the Bible. In other places, faith refers to one's faith in God. Here faith refers to one's faith in himself in doing the right thing. "All that is not out of faith is sin." This means if you have condemned yourself already, how can you expect God to justify you when He is so much greater than you? If our heart condemns us, we must be wrong. If what we do is right, God will give us the faith to believe that it is right. If what we do is wrong, we will not have this faith. Even after we have done it, we will still not be able to say with certainty that we have done the right thing, and we will feel empty within. When this happens, we will be certain that we are wrong. Since our heart has condemned us already, and since God is greater than our heart, surely He will condemn us also.</p><p>Paul said that if anyone invites us to a meal, we can go if we wish to go. This word is not for irresponsible Christians. Needless to say, it is not for unregenerated ones. But even a regenerated person who has never done God's will and has never lived for God is not qualified to take this word. One must abide in the Lord, and the Lord's word must abide in him before he can go as he wishes. If he should not go to a certain place, his inner being will not be able to muster enough strength to wish to go. If he tries to go anyway, something within will weaken him, advise him, and tell him that he cannot go. He is controlled by the law of life, and his will becomes a reflection of God's will. His wish becomes God's wish. We often want to do something by ourselves, and there is often the opportunity to do it by ourselves. But strangely, the minute we try to do it according to our own will, our inner being does not respond. The minute we do it, we feel squelched. The more we go on, the unhappier and weaker we become. In the end, we can only give it up because something within us is stronger than our own will.</p><p>God often directs us according to the willingness in our heart. For example, a person may invite us to a certain place, and we may desire to go. But strangely, even though we want to go, we cannot muster enough strength to say that we want to go. Our inner being is cold and unresponsive. Outwardly we want to go, but inwardly everything is cold. We cannot go, and if we do, every step we take brings more complaints and protests from within; something within will not let us go. This is God's will manifested through our will. But this word does not apply to everyone; it only applies to those who have God's life, who abide in the Lord, and in whom the Lord's word abides.</p><p>Consider the case of Paul casting out the spirit when he was in Philippi. A slave girl was possessed by a spirit, and following after Paul, she cried, "These men are slaves of the Most High God." Paul did not do anything for a few days. Should not Paul have cast out the spirit? He should have cast out demons the minute he saw them, yet Paul did not! His mouth could not move because his inner being had not moved. When his inner being was not moved, it meant that God was not moved. One day Paul became disturbed, and he said to the spirit, "I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her." Immediately the spirit came out of her (Acts 16:16-18). For Paul to be disturbed meant that God was disturbed. He spoke only when his inner being moved. Once he spoke, the spirit was cast out. God's word was in him; therefore, what he spoke was God's will.</p><p>The experiences of many believers testify to this. Sometimes someone suggests that we go and visit a brother, but nothing within us moves. If we go, we find it very awkward. But when our inner being moves and we have the word, a visit to our brother will bring in very good fellowship. We must wait until our inner being moves before we move in any outward way. If our inner being does not move, we should not move in any outward way.</p><p>While Paul was waiting for Silas and Timothy, he saw a whole city full of idols, and "his spirit was provoked within him" (17:16). Some may think that it is not a good thing to be "provoked." But Paul's provocation was a good thing. He was provoked by what he saw, and he went to preach at the Areopagus. The words he preached became an important part of the holy Scripture. On that occasion in Athens, Paul gave a good testimony. It was something that came from his heart, and he was constrained to speak it.</p><p>Another example can be seen in Paul's determination to pass Ephesus (20:16). He made the decision to do this. The Bible does not say that God decided, but Paul decided. Some Christians often say, "God's will has led me here. It is God's will that I should do this." They seem to be more spiritual than Paul. We do not see Paul speaking in such spiritual terms. Yet his decision fully corresponded with God's will because he was a person who knew the cross and feared God.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FORBIDDING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p>Some may ask, "Wasn't there the danger of Paul making a mistake when he made his decision that way?" There is not a simple answer to this. In Acts, after Paul set out from Antioch, there was no clear record of the leading of the Holy Spirit. Yet the Bible clearly records the forbidding of the Holy Spirit. Other than the vision at night (16:9), we see very little leading of the Holy Spirit in Paul on the positive side. We mainly see the forbidding of the Holy Spirit on the negative side.</p><p>If we abide in the Lord and His word abides in us, whatever decision we make will be God's will. But there is still the possibility of mistakes. If we make a mistake, the Holy Spirit will forbid us and not let us go. Paul's experience tells us this.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we do not have to be passive. Many Christians want to do God's will, yet they are too passive. God's will does not make a person passive. A man is passive because he does not understand God's will. If we are genuinely dealt with by the cross and are abiding in the Lord with His word abiding in us, God's will will become manifest in us, and we can act according to such a will within. If we are wrong, the Holy Spirit will stop us. He will make us indecisive; we will feel like a deflated tire, and we will sense that something is wrong, that it is meaningless to do such a thing, and that we cannot do it anymore. May the Lord deliver us from all misunderstanding and foolishness and save us from passivity. May He grant us an active attitude, and may He make us those who follow Him all the way.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">A DEEPER JOY</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Isa. 49:4-5; Matt. 11:25-30</h1><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>Isaiah is one of the prophets who prophesied a great deal concerning Christ. In Isaiah 49:5 we see the work of the Lord on earth. Verse 4 tells us whether the Lord's work on earth was successful. What was God's purpose in sending the Lord Jesus to the earth? It was for the purpose of turning the house of Jacob back to God, to gather them to Him. But what was the result? Did he succeed? According to man's view, our Lord failed completely. The house of Jacob did not turn to Him, and the Israelites rejected Him, denied Him, and crucified Him on the cross. Even one of His disciples betrayed Him. This is why verse 4 says, "But I said, I have labored in vain;/I have used up my strength for nothing and vanity." Brothers and sisters, in these circumstances&mdash;being despised by men on earth, with no result in the work, and seemingly having accomplished nothing for God's will&mdash;we surely would have wept in sorrow. Even if we had not wept, we surely would have been sad, and even if we had not been sad, at the very least, we would have become passive. But our Lord was different. After He said, "I have labored in vain;/I have used up my strength for nothing and vanity," He said, "Yet surely the justice due to me is with Jehovah,/And my recompense with my God." Although He did not gain what He hoped for and missed what He yearned for, His justice was with Jehovah. Although He had labored much and there did not seem to be any result in the work, His justice was with Jehovah. In other words, whether or not He was treated justly was something up to Jehovah. "My recompense [is] with my God." Although He could not obtain anything from the house of Jacob or from the Israelites, He would receive His reward from the Lord. Therefore, He was satisfied; He did not complain, weep, or grieve. This is the Lord's attitude.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, this shows us one thing&mdash;we cannot be directly related to our work; we can only be directly related to God. We cannot be directly connected to affairs or people; we can only be directly connected to God. Whenever we are directly related to work, affairs, and people, we will feel hurt, weep, and suffer as soon as we encounter difficulties and adversities. But if we are directly related to God, we will rejoice when we are rejected. Even when difficulties arise and everything seems to have failed, we will be able to rejoice. If we are directly related to God, no success or failure will touch us. We will only care for one thing&mdash;whether or not the justice due to us is with the Lord and whether our recompense is with Him. If our justice is with the Lord, our recompense will be with Him also.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>Matthew 11 speaks of the Lord's experience and attitude on earth; it matches the record of Isaiah 49. The entire chapter is about heartbreaking matters. First, John the Baptist sent his disciples to ask the Lord Jesus: "Are You the Coming One, or should we expect another?" (v. 3). This meant: "Are You the Messiah? Are You the Christ?" The forerunner of Jesus was now in doubt as to whether He was the Coming One! According to man, this was a very disappointing response.</p><p>John the Baptist came neither eating nor drinking, and men said that he had a demon. The Son of Man came eating and drinking; He came among men, communicated with men, and desired to save men. No one should have had anything to say about Him, yet they said that He was a gluttonous man and a drunkard. One group criticized people both for eating and for not eating; they always had something to say one way or the other. Another group had a lust for talking; they always found things to criticize no matter what our Lord did. They could always find something to say about Him. The Lord's forerunner was reviled as being possessed by demons, and the Lord Jesus was criticized as being a gluttonous man and a drunkard. He performed many miracles in Capernaum, Bethsaida, and Chorazin. But in the end, the people of Capernaum would not receive Him, and the men of Chorazin and Bethsaida rejected Him. Everything in Matthew 11 shows us the Lord as One who was distrusted, reviled, and rejected.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, what would you do if you encountered such a series of difficulties in your life, your work, or among your acquaintances? You would inevitably feel heartbroken and discouraged; you would feel that everything was over. But our Lord was different. The Bible speaks of His attitude: "At that time Jesus answered and said, I extol You, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth, because You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants. Yes, Father, for thus it has been well-pleasing in Your sight" (vv. 25-26). "At that time" means at that very moment. Under these circumstances and at the moment that He was doubted, reviled, and rejected, our Lord was able to say, "I extol You, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth." He had no bitterness, hatred, indignation, or wrath in His heart, and He could say, "I extol You, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth." Brothers and sisters, when you are being doubted, reviled, and rejected without a cause, can you extol the Lord? The time to extol Him is not when we gain something. The time to extol Him is not when our work is prosperous and we are welcomed and admired by many. We should extol Him when we are being doubted, reviled, and rejected for no reason. Brothers and sisters, can you extol Him at such times?</p><p>Our Lord extolled God here. What did He say? He said, "I extol You, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth, because You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants." Here is the greatest comfort: "Yes, Father, for thus it has been well-pleasing in Your sight." Since it was well-pleasing in the Father's sight, what more need be said? For the Lord Jesus, it was well-pleasing in the Father's sight for John to doubt Him. It was well-pleasing in the Father's sight for others to criticize Him as a gluttonous man and a drunkard. It was also well-pleasing in the Father's sight for the men of Capernaum, Bethsaida, and Chorazin to reject Him. He was satisfied with whatever was well-pleasing in the Father's sight. Therefore, He could say, "I extol You, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth." Many times, we cannot say, "Father." It seems as if we no longer believe that our God is our Father. Yet our Lord could say, "Father." He still felt that the Father was very near to Him. We often cannot say, "Lord of heaven and of earth." It seems as if we no longer believe that there is a Lord in heaven and on earth. Yet our Lord was satisfied with whatever was well-pleasing in the Father's sight. Therefore, He could say, "Father, Lord of heaven and of earth." He saw that everything was according to the Father's good pleasure. Therefore, He could say, "Yes, Father, for thus it has been well-pleasing in Your sight." Brothers and sisters, can you say, "Yes, Father, for thus it has been well-pleasing in Your sight"? Are you sorrowful, sad, and heartbroken just because you are misunderstood and facing difficulties? Can you utter a word of thanksgiving as a result of satisfaction in God's good pleasure? Can you say to God, "Yes, Father, for thus it has been well-pleasing in Your sight"? Brothers and sisters, can you say this?</p><h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>Following this, our Lord said something as a kind of explanation. It explained why He could say what He said. He said, "All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one fully knows the Son except the Father" (v. 27a). As long as the Father knew, that was enough. It did not matter that the men of Chorazin knew not. It did not matter that the men of Bethsaida or Capernaum knew not. It did not matter that the whole house of Jacob and all the Israelites, including all those who received help from Him, knew not. It even did not matter whether John misunderstood Him. There was only one thing which was important: "All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one fully knows the Son except the Father." As long as the Father knew, that was enough. Brothers and sisters, God knows. Is that enough for you? Or do you need John to know or the whole house of Jacob and all the Israelites to know you? Do you need the men of Capernaum, Bethsaida, and Chorazin to know you? Brothers and sisters, is it enough for God to know you? It is true that you cannot be without your brothers and sisters, but when no one knows you, you should be satisfied with living before God and being known by the Father only.</p><p>The Lord Jesus could say, "All things have been delivered to Me by My Father." Brothers and sisters, have all things been delivered to you by the Father? Or have all things been delivered to you by men? Can you say, "Father, everything I have is from You"? Can you say, "Father, I only want what is from You; I ask for nothing from men"? If you can say this, you can be at rest, and you can give praise.</p><p>The Lord said, "No one fully knows the Son except the Father." He also said, "Neither does anyone fully know the Father except the Son and he to whom the Son wills to reveal Him" (v. 27b). Only those who are willing to be known by God alone will know God, and only those who know God can lead others to the knowledge of God. Those who do not know the Father cannot lead others to the knowledge of the Father. Brothers and sisters, have you ever tried to help others and lead others to the knowledge of the Father? Why does your word not carry weight or move others? It is because what you have is not from the Father only. You feel that what you have from the Father is not enough; you are not content with what the Father has delivered to you. You still hope to gain something from men. If you are such a person, you cannot say that you are known by no one except the Father. Brothers and sisters, is it enough that you are known by God alone? If it is truly enough, then everything is all right. If you are satisfied with being known by God alone, you will know God. Only those who are known by God will know God, and only those who know God can lead others to the knowledge of God.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, if we are far from God, we cannot know Him. We do not know God because we care too much for human affection and are too weighed down by many things. We cannot lead others to the knowledge of God because we have received too much comfort and glory from men. If our heart is filled with all kinds of things apart from God, we will not know God. We have to remember the Lord's word, which says, "All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one fully knows the Son except the Father; neither does anyone fully know the Father except the Son and he to whom the Son wills to reveal Him." Brothers and sisters, if we drop all the things that are in our heart, we will know Him, and we will be able to lead others to the knowledge of Him; our heart will be pure, and those who have a pure heart will see God (Matt. 5:8).</p><h2 class="head1">FOUR</h2><p>After the Lord said this, He gave us a very comforting word: "Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light" (11:28-30). Our Lord showed us His own experience. He left us with a pattern and showed us how He found rest so that we can find rest also.</p><p>"Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest." Brothers and sisters, do you feel a heavy burden on you? Are you struggling day and night? Do you feel unhappy in your heart? The Lord is speaking to you, "Come. Come to Me, and I will give you rest." Do you have many worries? Do you have many burdens which you cannot bear? Are you grieving over your many failures? The Lord says to come to Him, and He will give us rest.</p><p>How does the Lord give us rest? He places Himself in front of us so that we can see His pattern. He says, "I am meek and lowly in heart." What is being meek? A brother once illustrated meekness this way: "Meekness is like the flax bumper on the side of the steamer boats. When a steamer comes close to the pier, if there is nothing between the hard boards of the boat and the hard poles of the pier, one of the two will break. But if flax bumpers are placed in between them, both will hit the bumpers only, and nothing will break." Brothers and sisters, this is meekness. If both sides are hard, neither side should touch the other. But if something soft is put between them, both sides will be preserved. Others may be hard, but if you are soft, you can withstand any bumping; they can bump as much as they like. The Lord said that He is meek. This means that He can withstand any bumping. Brothers and sisters, are you meek? You often want to have something, and you will not give up until you have it. You insist on having what you want, and no power can change you. Even God cannot change you. This is not being meek. What is being meek? Being meek is being changeable; it means taking what God wants you to take. It means being satisfied when you have something and being equally satisfied when you do not have something. When you have it, you can sing hallelujah and praise the Lord. When you do not have it, you can also sing hallelujah and praise the Lord. Being meek is being pliable enough to allow God to change your decision according to His will. Brothers and sisters, can God's will change your will? Can you change your decision, your desire, your hope, and your pursuit when God disapproves of them? You confess that God loves you, but when He does not give you what you want, will you be satisfied? Can you sing hallelujah? Brothers and sisters, a meek heart is an obedient heart. Being meek is not insisting on one's own will, not persisting with one's own proposals, and not demanding what one wants. A meek person changes when God changes and turns when God turns. Whatever God wants to do, he agrees. Whoever is like this will find rest.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, rest is precious. Many Christians live on earth without any rest; they are frequently dissatisfied and always complaining. This is their condition because they always have unfulfilled demands and desires. The Lord showed us, however, that the condition for rest is meekness. Sometimes God's way is in conflict with our way. If we are willing to turn, we will say, "God, I yield." If we do not yield, we are not meek. Brothers and sisters, we must be meek. If our heart is not meek, we cannot find rest. We must remember that meekness is the first condition for rest.</p><p>The Lord Jesus was not only meek but also lowly in heart. We often have wild thoughts and fleshly desires. We have vain hopes and fruitless schemes. We often compare ourselves to other brothers and sisters, and we are not happy when they are ahead of us; we want to be taller and greater than they are. Our thoughts are filled with pride and boasting. We are not lowly in heart, and we are not like the Lord Jesus. Our Lord is meek and lowly in heart. His eyes are not haughty, and He never hopes to gain anything for Himself. He is willing to accept everything from God. He can say that it is enough, and He is satisfied. This is being meek and lowly in heart. Brothers and sisters, are you satisfied with what God has given you? Or do you constantly covet more and greater things? Is God's provision enough for you? Or do you insist on your way concerning certain things and affairs? Brothers and sisters, God is after those who are lowly in heart. Many people have great ambitions and aspirations, but these things do not count in God's eyes, and God cannot use such ones. They are not lowly in heart, and they do not have rest. They do not have any rest because they are not satisfied with what God has given them.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, can your decisions be changed? Can you change your mind and drop your proposals and your hope for God's sake? If you are ambitious and aspiring and if you are always after this thing and that thing, you are not meek and lowly in heart. A meek person accepts whatever God gives him. He can say hallelujah and praise the Lord for whatever He gives him. Our Lord Jesus is meek; He is pliable before God. Our Lord Jesus is also lowly in heart; He does not demand anything for Himself. Only those who are meek can be led by God, and only those who are lowly in heart can satisfy God's desire.</p><p>The Lord said, "Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me...and you will find rest for your souls." The Lord's own experience shows us that we have to take His yoke and learn from Him in order to find rest. Our biggest problem is that we often despise God's will. As a result, we find no rest for our soul and are not joyful. There are two kinds of joy in the Bible. One is the joy of believing in God's grace. The other is the joy of obeying God's will. We have believed in God's grace, but are we willing to obey His will? Brothers and sisters, is there any unhappiness in our heart? Is there any dissatisfaction in us? Are we murmuring against something which is contrary to our wish? If any of these things are in us, it means that we have not submitted to God's will. All those who have some experience can testify that nothing is more joyful than consecration, and nothing brings more happiness than placing oneself in the Lord's hand and under His direction. If we are not joyful and satisfied in heart, the only possible reason for this is that we have not taken the Lord's yoke and learned from Him. This kind of joy is a deeper joy, in which everything we have is delivered to us by the Father, and we can say, "Yes, Father, whatever You decide is the best." This is what we see from our Lord's experience.</p><h2 class="head1">FIVE</h2><p>Brothers and sisters, if you do not have rest or joy, it is because there is something within you that you will not let go. It may not be certain particular things, but there is always something. Some people are very depressed because there are troubles going on within them. Brothers and sisters, is there any trouble going on within you? Is there anything that you dare not ask the Lord about? Is there anything that you dare not think about? Many Christians dare not look into themselves for fear that they will find problems. Many Christians try to run away when God touches them; they dare not sit still and think for a few minutes. They struggle and keep themselves occupied; they cannot find rest and do not have any joy. Brothers and sisters, if you are truly taking the Lord's yoke and learning from Him, you will be filled with peace and praise. A brother was once packing up his luggage and leaving his hometown to go to another place to preach the gospel. As he was leaving, he said, "From now on, I leave behind my kinfolk, my family, and my friends." Then he said, "I am now the happiest man on earth!" Brothers and sisters, perhaps you only know the joy of salvation, but this brother knew the joy of consecration. Indeed, our heart often may be grieving, but our mouth is filled with praise. What a pity that the praise of many Christians is blocked by many things! This does not necessarily mean that there is sin. It means that they have too many things apart from God. If we allow the Lord to remove these things, our heart will find rest, and we will be filled with joy.</p><p>Many brothers and sisters have too deep of a relationship with man. Their relationship with man is deeper than their relationship with God. One day, when they lose this human love and care, they lose their rest and joy. Brothers and sisters, if you encountered unending misunderstanding, reviling, and rejection like the Lord, how would you feel? What would you say? Some would begin to reason and argue with the Lord, and they would lose their rest and joy. But if they would come before the Lord and say, "Lord, I say yes and amen to all the things that you have allowed to come upon me," they would immediately be filled with heavenly rest and joy.</p><p>A brother was walking along a wilderness path one night under the moonlight, and God said to him pointedly, "What would you do if I take away your beloved one?" He answered, "Lord, I cannot accept this." The Lord said, "You are weak, and you cannot accept it. But if I make you able to accept it, what will you say?" He said, "Lord, I thank You and praise You because I cannot make it, but You can make it." He allowed God to do His work and was willing to submit to His will. He wept and consecrated himself to God. The strange thing was that once he submitted, he was immediately filled with heavenly joy and peace. Brothers and sisters, have you ever tasted the heavenly joy and peace? The Lord is waiting to give you the heavenly joy and peace. The question is whether or not you are willing to take His yoke and learn from Him. You have not received the Lord's blessing and His blessing still has not flowed to others through you because you are still unhappy with His demands. The Lord said, "My yoke is easy and My burden is light." Brothers and sisters, do you believe in this word? Those who do not know God will say that God is harsh, that He reaps where He has not sowed and gathers where He has not scattered. But those who know God will say that His yoke is easy and His burden light.</p><p>But the strange thing is that many of God's children are afraid of hearing about His will. They can sing hallelujah when they hear about God's love, wisdom, and power. But they are afraid to hear about God's will. What happened with our Lord? He did not call God's will His will; He called it "well-pleasing in Your sight." To the Lord, all of God's will is well-pleasing. Brothers and sisters, we have to believe in God's love. We have to believe that He loves us. This will put our heart at ease no matter what we encounter. Many times we ask for fish, and it seems that God has given us serpents. We ask for bread, and it seems that God has given us stones. We ask why God has given us a serpent when we asked for fish, and why He has given us a stone when we asked for bread. But, many times, when we think that we are asking for fish, we are actually asking for a serpent. What God gives us may look like a serpent, but it is actually fish. Many times when we think we are asking for bread we are actually asking for a stone. What God gives us may look like a stone but it is actually bread. We often think that God has not answered our prayer. We think that God does not love us. Actually, He is giving us the best thing. Our God is never wrong. The trouble is that many people do not believe in God's love. We need to remember that God causes heartbreaking things and difficulties to come upon us because He wants to perfect us and give the best things to us, not because He does not love us. If we believe that everything is well-pleasing in God's sight, we will sing with tears in our eyes.</p><p>We should not only believe in God's love but also in His wisdom. He loves us, and He knows everything. His love never changes, and His wisdom never errs. Nothing will come upon us that is not profitable for us. God's power will bring us through everything we need to go through, and this power will enable us to bear the burdens that come upon us. Therefore, we can say before the Lord, "Thank the Lord. Praise Him because His will is never wrong." Praising God for His grace is initial praise; praising Him for His will is mature praise. Initial praise is praising Him for what we have; mature praise is praising Him for what we lose. Brothers and sisters, we can rest, and we can rejoice because in everything we see God's love, His wisdom, and His power.</p><p>In the book The Streams in the Desert (Oct. 24), there is this passage: "A piece of iron that is worth five dollars will be worth $10 when it is cast into a horseshoe. If it is made into needles, it will be worth $350. If it is made into fine blades, it will be worth $32,000, and if it is made into springs inside watches, it will be worth $250,000." Brothers and sisters, have you seen this? What is the difference between a piece of iron worth $10, $350, $32,000, and $250,000? It is the same material, but after many trials and much beating, it becomes stronger, more pliable, and more valuable. In order to make us more valuable, God brings us through many trials and beatings. In order to become a useful and valuable vessel before the Lord, we must not bemoan the things that God has allowed to come upon us. Instead, we should rejoice and rest. We should say to the Lord, "Father, I thank You, because everything You have allowed to come upon me is good." If we submit to the will of God, our heart will find rest, and we will be filled with joy. Our mouth will be full of praise, and our burden will no longer be a burden.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we have seen that our Lord possessed a deeper joy because He believed that "the justice due to me is with Jehovah, and my recompense with my God." He believed that "it has been well-pleasing in Your sight." He told us clearly that we would find rest for our souls if we took His yoke and learned from Him. Brothers and sisters, if we want to partake of this deeper joy, we should believe in His word, take His yoke, and learn from Him. Thank the Lord that His yoke is easy and His burden is light.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</h1><h1 class="title">THE ARK&mdash;</h1><h1 class="title">THE CENTER OF THE TABERNACLE</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 25:10-22</h1><p>The ark occupies a very important place in the Bible. When God ordered Moses to build the tabernacle, the ark was the first thing that was mentioned. On the day the tabernacle was erected, the altar for the burnt offering and the laver were in the outer court, and the lampstand, the table, the showbread, and the golden incense altar were in the Holy Place. But in the Holy of Holies there was only the ark (Exo. 40:17-33). God met with man upon the ark and spoke with man from the midst of the cherubim upon the mercy seat on the ark. Hence, the ark is the center of the tabernacle, and it occupies a very important position.</p><h2 class="head1">ONE</h2><p>Let us first consider the name of the ark. In Exodus, it is called the ark of the testimony; it does not say the ark of the covenant. The ark of the testimony means that God's testimony was among the Israelites. Wherever the ark was, God was there also. The presence of the ark proved the presence of God's law. In Numbers, the ark is given another name, "the ark of the covenant" (10:33; 14:44). This means that the ark was related to the covenant. Wherever the ark was, the covenant was there also. In 1 Samuel, we see another name, "the ark of God" (4:11, 13, 17, 19, 21-22). Wherever the ark was, God was there also. The ark represented God. When the ark was with the people, it meant that God was with His people.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO</h2><p>What does the ark typify? The ark typifies the Lord Jesus. The ark was within the tabernacle, which typifies that God is with man. The coming of the Lord Jesus is the presence of God among men. He is Emmanuel (Matt. 1:23). Wherever He went, God was there. In the Old Testament, the ark was in the Holy of Holies. Today Christ is in the heavenly Holy of Holies (Heb. 8:1-2). When God ordered the Israelites to make the tabernacle, the first thing He mentioned was the ark. This signifies that the Lord is the center of everything. The ark was built with acacia wood and covered with gold within and without. Acacia wood is a very hard wood; it typifies the humanity of the Lord. Gold in the Bible signifies God's righteousness, glory, and all His attributes. Hence, gold typifies the Lord's divinity. The Lord Jesus is both God and man. With Him there is both divinity and humanity.</p><p>Upon the ark, which was two and a half cubits by one and a half cubits by one and a half cubits, there was a mercy seat. The mercy seat covered the ark and was made of pure gold. Its length and width were the same as the ark. Two cherubim wrought of gold were placed on the two ends of the mercy seat. They stretched their wings and covered the mercy seat. The cherubim had their faces toward each other and were over the mercy seat. (Cherubim signify the manifestation of God's glory&mdash;Ezek. 9:3; Heb. 9:5.) God told Moses: "And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel" (Exo. 25:22). From then on, God directed the Israelites in their walk and work from the place of the ark. The mercy seat in the Old Testament signifies the place that God dispenses His grace. In the New Testament, all of God's grace is dispensed to us through Christ. Leviticus 16 tells us that the high priest brought the blood of animals into the Holy of Holies every year on the seventh month when he offered up the sacrifice of the sin offering and sprinkled blood upon the mercy seat. In the same way, the Lord accomplished redemption, and His blood declares before God that the work of redemption is finished and that God must forgive our sins. Simply put, the ark typifies Christ; it typifies God's dispensing grace to us through Christ. When we have Christ, we have God's presence, and through Christ, we receive God's leading.</p><p>There were four golden rings upon the four feet of the ark, and two staves made of acacia wood and overlaid with gold were placed through the rings in order to carry the ark. The staves were to be inside the rings all the time and were not to be taken out. This meant that the ark could be moved at any time. This shows us two functions of the ark. On the one hand, it was the center of worship to God. The ark was placed in the Holy of Holies, which was the place where God met with man. In order to worship God, one had to go to the ark. Without the ark, there could be no worship. On the other hand, the ark was the direction to God's people. When the ark moved forward, the people followed (Num. 10:33; Josh. 3:3). The Israelites could not go as they pleased. They could only go where the ark directed them to go. This shows us that Christ is the One who directs us to the proper way.</p><p>How was the ark carried? Numbers 4:5-6 says, "And when the camp is to set out, Aaron and his sons shall go in and take down the veil of the screen, and cover the ark of the testimony with it; then they shall put a covering of porpoise skin over it, and spread over that a cloth all of blue, and they shall place its poles in it." Every time the ark was about to move, three things covered it. First, the veil that separated the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies was taken down and laid on it. Second, a covering of porpoise skin was used to cover it. Third, a cloth all of blue was used to cover it. The moving of the ark signifies the time for the proclamation of Christ. The veil signifies the body of Christ (Heb. 10:20). Now the veil is rent, which means that the Christ we proclaim has become an approachable Lord. The ark was also covered with porpoise skin. Porpoise skin looks ugly on the outside. This signifies the Lord's humiliation and rejection. The ark was also covered with a cloth all of blue. In the Bible, white signifies righteousness, gold signifies glory and anything divine, purple signifies authority, while blue signifies heavenliness, because the sky is blue. This shows us that the Christ we follow is, on the one hand, outwardly uncomely like the porpoise skin; He was rejected by men. But on the other hand, He was like a cloth all of blue, heavenly and acceptable to God. In short, the Christ we proclaim is an approachable Lord, a rejected Lord, yet a Christ who is acceptable to God.</p><h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>Let us consider the history of the ark a little. This shows us the relationship between the ark and the Israelites, and from it we can find the relationship between Christ and us.</p><h2 class="head2">The Ark Crossing the Jordan</h2><p>How did the Israelites cross the river Jordan when they were about to enter Canaan? Joshua 3:10-17 says, "And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you....Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan....And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the Lord, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand upon a heap. And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people; and as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest,) that the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon a heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan; and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho. And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan." This passage of the Scripture tells us how the ark led the Israelites into Canaan. The first thing that went into the water was the ark, and the ark was the last thing that came out of the water. This shows us that a power greater than death was leading the Israelites safely across Jordan to the bank on the other side. Our death and resurrection with the Lord is like the Israelites crossing the Jordan; the ark is there taking the lead ahead of us.</p><h2 class="head2">The Ark in Shiloh</h2><p>After the Israelites entered Canaan and when the warfare was over, the whole congregation gathered in Shiloh and erected the tabernacle (Josh. 18:1). When Eli the priest was old, his two sons were evil and did not know the Lord; yet they were taking over the work of the priest. Eli could do nothing about them because he honored his sons more than the Lord. Later a man of God prophesied: "And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation in all the wealth which God shall give Israel" (1 Sam. 2:32). This means that God would forsake the tabernacle. "And the word of the Lord was precious in those days; there was no open vision. And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see; and ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the Lord, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep; that the Lord called Samuel" (3:1-4). Although the lamp of God, which was in the temple of Lord where the ark was located, had not gone completely out and although the tabernacle was the same outwardly, God's presence was about to depart. At that time, God no longer called Eli, He called Samuel. He did not convey His word to Eli but to Samuel. From that time on, Eli was put aside, and God chose a child, Samuel, to be His prophet (v. 20).</p><p>Soon after this, the ark left the tabernacle in Shiloh. First Samuel 4:3 says, "And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the Lord smitten us today before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies." The Israelites went to war with the Philistines and lost, and they thought they could avert their defeat if they brought out the ark. God's tabernacle was in Shiloh, and they carried the ark from Shiloh to their camp and shouted with a great shout (v. 5). But what was the result? "And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen. And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain" (vv. 10-11). When these men were in peril, they tried to utilize the ark. But in the end, even the ark was captured. They thought that God would surely help them when the ark was in their midst, that God would surely not forsake His ark. But God did not do this. He allowed them to be defeated and the ark to be carried away. How serious this is! If anyone thinks that by proclaiming, "I have God" or "I come in the name of the Lord," they can overcome, they are making the same mistake as the Israelites. The Israelites were defeated before the Philistines because they did not deal with their sins. They did not realize that there could be no victory unless sin was first dealt with. They had forgotten the fact that they had rebelled against God, and they thought they would be victorious by clinging to the ark. They were wrong. God's ark cannot be used this way. We must forever remember that the flesh can never exploit spiritual things. The name of Christ can never be exploited by the flesh. If anyone tries to exploit spiritual things or use the name of the Lord in vain, the result will be total failure. The Israelites tried to exploit God's ark. They did not realize that God's glory had left Israel already. God allowed the ark to be taken away. We must remember that God's glory did not leave the tabernacle in Shiloh as a result of the ark being captured. God left the tabernacle in Shiloh first, and then the ark was captured later (Psa. 78:60-61). Once God's ark left the tabernacle in Shiloh, it never went back to Shiloh again!</p><h2 class="head2">The Ark in the Land of the Philistines</h2><p>What happened after the ark was taken to the land of the Philistines? The ark was well able to protect itself. First Samuel 5 says, "And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Ebenezer unto Ashdod. When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon. And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the Lord. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again. And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the Lord; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him....But the hand of the Lord was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and the coasts thereof" (vv. 1-6). The men of Ashdod were afraid and gathered together the lords of the Philistines and asked what they should do. They decided to send the ark of the God of Israel to Gath. But after the ark arrived there, everyone in the city, both great and small, had emerods, and so they sent the ark of God to Ekron. The Ekronites cried out saying, "They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to slay us and our people" (v. 10). They sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines and asked that the ark of Jehovah be sent back to its own place. The ark of the Lord was in the land of the Philistines for seven months. How did they send the ark of the God of Israel back? Chapter six tells us that the priests and diviners among the Philistines came up with a new way. They made a new cart and took two milk cows, on which there had come no yoke, tied the cows to the cart, brought their calves home from them, and put the ark of the Lord on the cart. They also prepared gifts for a trespass offering, five golden mice and five golden emerods, and put them on the cart. They said, "See, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to Bethshemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us; it was a chance that happened to us" (v. 9). The amazing thing was that the cart went straight on until it stopped at a place called Bethshemesh. The lords of the Philistines were subdued. This is why we say that the ark was well able to protect itself.</p><h2 class="head2">The Ark in Bethshemesh</h2><p>What happened after the ark reached Bethshemesh? "And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see it" (v. 13). But following this, a tragic thing happened. "And he [Jehovah] smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the ark of the Lord, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented, because the Lord had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter. And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy Lord God? and to whom shall he go up from us? And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the Lord; come ye down, and fetch it up to you" (vv. 9-21). The presence of Christ is a blessing, but a man must also be holy in His sight. The men of Bethshemesh looked into the ark of the Lord and did not have a fear of the Lord. Hence, God smote them. After they were smitten, they did not want the ark anymore. Rather than dealing with the reason for being smitten, they decided instead to reject the Lord's presence. What a pity this is!</p><h2 class="head2">The Ark in Kirjathjearim</h2><p>What was the attitude of the men of Kirjathjearim towards the ark? "And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of the Lord, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the Lord. And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the Lord" (7:1-2). The ark came out of Shiloh, yet it never went back to Shiloh. It was in the house of Abinadab in Kirjathjearim for twenty years. In Shiloh there was the tabernacle, but there was no ark. How empty Shiloh was! Now the house of Abinadab had the Lord's presence. Brothers and sisters, the ark would never return to Shiloh again. The question now is: Are we like the men of Bethshemesh who feared the Lord's presence, or are we like the men of Kirjathjearim who welcomed His presence?</p><h2 class="head2">The Ark in the House of Obededom</h2><p>After twenty years, David was raised up as king. Once he came to the throne, he ordered that the ark be taken to Jerusalem. First Chronicles 13:1-3 says, "And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader...let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we inquired not at it in the days of Saul." It was right and good for David to try to bring the ark to Jerusalem. But what did they do? "And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart....And David and all the house of Israel played before the Lord on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on cymbals" (2 Sam. 6:3, 5). In the midst of such rejoicing, something tragic unexpectedly happened. "And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it. And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah, and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God....And David was afraid of the Lord that day, and said, How shall the ark of the Lord come to me? So David would not remove the ark of the Lord unto him into the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite. And the ark of the Lord continued in the house of Obededom the Gittite three months: and the Lord blessed Obededom, and all his household" (vv. 6-11). Rather than investigating the reason that the oxen were shaken, David rejected the ark from the city of David just because Uzzah was smitten. Yet the house of Obededom welcomed the ark, and his household was blessed. Brothers and sisters, are we going to forsake the Lord's presence as soon as we suffer God's dealings? Or are we going to welcome His presence like the household of Obededom?</p><p>David was wrong because He intended to move the ark of God to Jerusalem and discussed it with the captains of thousands and hundreds, but he did not search into the law for the proper way to move the ark. According to Numbers 4:4-15, the ark was to be carried by the Levites. God did not order the ark to be drawn by a cart. The cart with the oxen was a method copied from the Philistines. God did not blame the Philistines for their ignorance, but He would not allow David to ignore God's command and follow the way of the Philistines. This shows us that any zeal for God that is according to a new method not found in the Bible or according to a novel way apart from God's will can never last and will eventually bring in disaster. At the beginning, the playing was exciting, and many people were there. But after a while, everything stopped. God takes no pleasure in temporary excitement. He will not allow the flesh to touch anything that He has ordained for individuals as well as for the church. He will not allow man to alter any of His arrangements. Uzzah probably put forth his hand to stop the ark of God from falling because he loved the ark and was zealous for it. But God was not pleased. He did not allow Uzzah to touch the ark with his fleshly hands. In other words, God did not allow man to uphold errors with fleshly hands. Perhaps you think that your idea is better than God's ways. But God will not allow you to change anything. You can only work according to God's design. Otherwise, you will see nothing except God's judgment. Perhaps some will say that many people in the church are replacing God's will with fleshly ways. Why is it that God has not judged them? We must say with fear and trembling that it is either because the time has not come or because the ark has left them! We should not despise God just because of His forbearance and endurance.</p><h2 class="head2">The Ark in David's Tent</h2><p>David did not know why God smote Uzzah. He was afraid to move the ark to Jerusalem. Yet while the ark was in the house of Obededom, God blessed Obededom and his household. When someone told David about this, he happily moved the ark of God from the house of Obededom to the city of David (2 Sam. 6:12; 1 Chron. 15:25). This time it was different. In his preparation David ordered: "None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the Lord chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever" (1 Chron. 15:2). He had learned the lesson. In the past, he thought he could do what the Philistines did. Now he knew that God's service had to be done according to God's pattern and not according to man's pattern. Now the Levites carried the ark. As a result, "They brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God. And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord" (16:1-2).</p><h2 class="head2">Solomon and the Ark</h2><p>There was still another story related to the ark. First Kings 3:4 says, "And the king [Solomon] went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar." On the night after the offering, Jehovah appeared to Solomon in a dream. He prayed for wisdom, and the Lord granted his request; He even gave him what he did not ask for. When he woke from his dream, what did he immediately do? "And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants" (v. 15). Read  again this account in 2 Chronicles 1:3-4: "So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the Lord had made in the wilderness. But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to the place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem." At that time, the tabernacle was in Gibeon, but the ark was not there anymore. While the tabernacle was in Gibeon, the ark was in Jerusalem. Therefore, after Solomon received wisdom, the first thing he did was to return to Jerusalem and offer sacrifices before the ark. He no longer offered sacrifices in Gibeon. This was a great turn in Solomon. Outwardly speaking, the tabernacle, the altar, the laver, the lampstand, the table with the showbread, and the golden incense altar were at Shiloh. But the ark was not there. (The tabernacle in Gibeon was the same tabernacle that was in Shiloh, because 2 Chronicles 1:3 clearly says that the tabernacle in Gibeon "was the tabernacle of the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the Lord had made in the wilderness.") Man thinks that it does not mean much to be without the ark. Yet the ark represents the presence of God, and without His presence, His heart cannot be satisfied even if everything else is good. Neither will our hearts be satisfied. Before Solomon received the Lord's revelation, he did not realize the importance of the ark. But after he received the Lord's revelation, he was enlightened and realized that the Lord's presence was more precious that anything else, and he returned to Jerusalem and offered sacrifices before the ark of the Lord. In Gibeon he only offered burnt offerings, but in Jerusalem he offered both burnt offerings and peace offerings and prepared a feast for all his servants. True worship is a worship that is before the Lord. True fellowship is a fellowship that is before the Lord, and true joy is a joy that is before the Lord. This was Solomon's experience; it is also the experience of many who know the Lord. O ark, precious ark! Those who know You will seek after You and will worship before You. When Solomon finished building the temple, he placed the ark in the temple, and the ark became the center once again in the temple (2 Chron. 5:1-9).</p><h2 class="head1">FOUR</h2><p>We have seen much of the history of the ark. The purpose for this study is to find out the relationship between Christ and the church. We have seen that the ark represents Christ. When the ark crossed the Jordan, it typified the Lord's death and resurrection. After His death and resurrection, we began to preach Christ, telling men that the veil has been rent and that Christ has opened a new and living way to God for us. We also tell people that He was the despised One, the One typified by the porpoise skin, yet He is now the One with whom God is pleased. He comes forth from God, as typified by the cloth all of blue. We are here to preach a Christ who was despised, who was exalted by God, and who is now glorified before God.</p><p>At its beginning, the church indeed preached a heavenly Christ. But even before the age of the apostles was over, changes had crept in. At the time of Paul, some had risen up to preach "a different gospel" (Gal. 1:6). Peter also warned that we should beware of "destructive heresies" (2 Pet. 2:1). John told us that we have to be aware of "the deceiver and the antichrist" (2 John 7). This shows us that there was an adulterating of the Lord's word even at that time. When Constantine rose up, he made Christianity the state religion and made the bishop of Rome the head of the whole church. Originally, the name of Christ was found inside the church only. At this time, it was found outside the church. The ark which was in Shiloh was now in the land of the Philistines. Once God's ark left the tabernacle in Shiloh, it never went back again. Jeremiah 26:6 says, "Then I will make this house like Shiloh, and this city I will make a curse to all the nations of the earth." In other words, although the tabernacle was still in Shiloh, God's ark was gone; His rejection of the tabernacle in Shiloh became certain.</p><p>God's children are truly in need of a revelation. They need the revelation of Solomon! God appeared to Solomon and opened his eyes. He gave Solomon a great turn and showed him the preciousness of the ark and the vanity of a tabernacle without the ark. Brothers and sisters, are we for God's ark, or are we for a tabernacle that is void of the ark? Will we choose Christ, or will we choose a Christless religious form? We must consider whether our emphasis and center is Christ or whether we are maintaining a tabernacle in Shiloh which is void of the ark. Man considers the tabernacle in Shiloh precious; they grasp firmly to it. They think that since it was once the house of God, it will always be the house of God. But they are wrong. Jeremiah 7:4 says, "Do not trust in the words of falsehood that say, The temple of Jehovah, the temple of Jehovah, these buildings are the temple of Jehovah." God rebuked the Israelites because they cared for nothing except vain words, saying, "This is the temple of Jehovah," three times. Little did they realize that the temple became the temple of Jehovah because God was the center of the temple. Once God left the temple, the temple became nothing but an ordinary building. Brothers and sisters, the thing we have to treasure is the ark and not the tabernacle because the center of the tabernacle is the ark. The question now is: Is Christ the center, or are we holding onto the tabernacle as an empty shell? Brothers and sisters, if our heart is for Christ, we must look for the place where Christ is the center. We should be at the place where the name of Christ is found. Brothers and sisters, is Christ the center in the place where you are? If He is, we thank and praise the Lord! If He is not, may the Lord open our eyes, and may He turn us back to Jerusalem like Solomon, after he received the revelation to worship before the ark. May the Lord cause us to realize the vanity of our zealous service of the past, and may He bring us into the joy and peace before the ark, so that we can offer genuine service and worship to Him. Brothers and sisters, I earnestly pray that the Lord grants you a revelation of His preciousness, so that you make Him your excellent treasure and your center, offering up the burnt offering to Him, living for Him, and satisfying His heart!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">HE IS NOT WHO IS ONE OUTWARDLY,<br />BUT WHO IS ONE INWARDLY</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 2:28-29; Gal. 1:11-16</h1><p>We should focus on a few expressions from the two verses we have read in Romans 2: "For he is not...who is one outwardly...But he is...who is one inwardly"; "in spirit, not in letter"; "not from men, but from God." Here are a few contrasts: "outwardly" versus "inwardly"; "spirit" versus "letter"; and "from men" versus "from God." The Bible shows us clearly through these contrasts the fact that Christianity is not a matter of outward regulations, forms, and ceremonies but a matter of the inner life. Christianity is not an outward religion or a product of the human mind; Christianity is an inward revelation and a religion of life.</p><p>What is it to be a Christian? A Christian is one who has the life of the Lord within him. Some people were baptized when they were young; they attend church services regularly and carry a Bible with them. They can recite the Lord's Prayer and know the Ten Commandments. They can sing hymns and say amen to others' prayers, and they are very familiar with  the stories in the Bible. They even consider themselves to be Christians. But are they? The Bible says that "he is not...who is one outwardly." Therefore, a Christian is not a Christian by teaching or by learning. A Christian becomes a Christian inwardly; he is a person who has the life of the Lord within him. The Lord Jesus said, "I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly" (John 10:10). A Christian is a person who has something to do with life. He is not one outwardly but one inwardly.</p><p>Life comes from the Lord Himself. In fact, life is the Lord Himself. A man receives this life through knowing the Lord Jesus and through knowing Him as the Son of God and as the Christ of God. This knowledge comes from God's revelation. Paul had been instructed in the law according to the strict traditions of his fathers. He persecuted the church greatly and thought that by so doing he was zealously serving God. When the Lord appeared to him, he repented and was saved. He testified in Galatians 1 that his gospel was not received from men nor taught by men; it came from the revelation of Jesus Christ. If a man has not received any revelation from God, his zeal is vain. He may be able to keep all the traditions of his fathers, but these traditions can never give him God's life. Paul did not become a Christian through men. He became a Christian because it pleased God to reveal His Son in him.</p><p>Once the Lord asked the disciples, "Who do men say that the Son of Man is?" They answered, "Some, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets." The Lord then asked the disciples, "But you, who do you say that I am?" Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." The Lord immediately said to him, "Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens" (Matt. 16:13-17). This shows us clearly that a Christian must be one who has received a revelation from God. If you want to be a Christian, you must have this revelation and knowledge. If you say that you admire the life of Jesus, this will not make you a Christian. If you say that Jesus' teaching contains some very deep philosophy, this will not make you a Christian either. You may not agree with this word. You may argue: "I admire Jesus and honor Him; I am favorably inclined towards Christianity. Does that not make me a Christian?" No, it does not. Being a Christian is not a question of admiring or not admiring; it is not a question of being favorably or ill inclined towards Christianity. Some considered the Lord Jesus to be John the Baptist, Elijah, or Jeremiah. Was not John the Baptist good? Was not Elijah good? Was not Jeremiah good? Yet these were all man's views and man's opinions. Christianity is absolutely not from man. Therefore, human views and human opinions cannot replace Christianity. Christianity is a religion of revelation. Only those who have received a revelation from God and who know the Lord Jesus as the Christ, the Son of the living God, are blessed by the Lord.</p><p>Once a man receives a revelation, he touches the Lord Jesus in the Holy Spirit, and he comes face to face with the Lord Jesus. He has a direct relationship with Him and has made contact with the Lord. Let me give a little illustration. Once an electrical power line in a brother's home became worn out. It was easy to receive an electric shock from the wire. The brother was not careful enough and touched the line. Immediately he withdrew his hand and shouted, "What a shock! What a shock!" His young son saw how his hand stretched out and pulled back, and he imitated his father and pretended that he had been shocked also. He stretched out his little hand and pulled it back shouting, "What a shock! What a shock!" But we know that the son was acting in an outward way; he was imitating. The father was genuinely shocked by the electricity; he tasted the reality of the experience. Brothers and sisters, outward imitations do not count; it is the real taste that counts. You must touch Christ like the brother who touched the electrical current. Do you know that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God today? It is not what men say, but what you say within yourself that counts. You may not have any knowledge within you, and you may only have heard about Him from others. When others say that He is the Son of God, you echo and say the same thing. When others say that Jesus was a great social reformer, you follow suit and say the same thing. Your "faith" is one that revolves around others. I am afraid that you are not clear what you believe in.</p><p>In John 3, the Lord Jesus discussed the question of regeneration with Nicodemus, who said, "We know that You have come from God as a teacher." The Lord answered him, saying, "Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God" (vv. 2-3). With a teacher, the main emphasis is teaching and learning; these are all outward matters. With regeneration, it is a question of spirit and life; these are inward matters. Many so-called Christians have tried to enter through the gate called "Teacher." They think that as long as they understand the teachings of Christianity, as long as they are baptized and are familiar with the prophecies and types of the Bible, and as long as they have picked up outward Christian behavior such as prayer, attending services, and tithing, they can consider themselves good Christians. These people are wrong about Christianity. The Bible shows us that a Christian life begins from regeneration. If a man is not regenerated and does not have the life of the Lord within Him, he is not yet a Christian. Let me repeat: Christianity is not an outward religion but an inward revelation. A Christian is not one who is one outwardly but who is one inwardly.</p><p>In John 6, the Lord Jesus fed the five thousand with five loaves and two fish. The same group of people looked for Jesus the next day, and the Lord told them plainly: "You seek Me...because you ate of the bread and were filled. Work not for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides unto eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you" (vv. 26-27). Again He said: "I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes into Me shall by no means ever thirst" (v. 35). These men came to the Lord Jesus because they ate bread and were filled. They did not know what their real need was. Neither did they know what the Lord was giving to men when He came to the earth. They only saw the physical bread without but did not see the preciousness of the life within. The Lord Jesus was full of mercy; He did not hide Himself from these ignorant ones. He opened Himself to them and told them that He is the bread of life and that He gives life to those who believe in Him. But these ones were still circling around the periphery. They asked, "Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know?" (v. 42). They only knew the Lord Jesus from the outside. The Lord told them again, "I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever; and the bread which I will give is My flesh, given for the life of the world" (v. 51). The Jews contended with one another because of this word. Their eyes only saw outward things. They wanted to know the Lord Jesus and understand His words in an outward way. But it was impossible for them to know and understand in this way.</p><p>We have to pay attention to the words which followed. Not only were the Jews bewildered by the Lord's word, but many of His disciples did not understand it either. They said, "This word is hard; who can hear it?" (v. 60). Many of the disciples went back to what they had left behind and no longer walked with Him. They stumbled and were no longer His disciples. Five loaves and two fish on the outside attracted many to seek after the Lord Jesus. But when the inward bread of life was presented, many so-called disciples could not take it. How easy it is for men to pay attention to outward things and reject inward things! Brothers and sisters, we ought to be warned here! Many who were called disciples dropped out halfway. Those who are Christians in an outward way will drop out halfway. Those who do not touch life will drop out halfway. Anyone who has not received the Lord's life within him cannot be His disciple. No one needs to discourage such a one from becoming a Christian; he himself will find it impossible to go on.</p><p>These so-called disciples did not withdraw because of tribulations or trials. There was only one reason for their withdrawal: "This word is hard; who can hear it?" They fell in the presence of the truth! Brothers and sisters, nothing outward works. An outward Christian will fall in the presence of the truth; there is no need for trials to come to him. Some people call themselves Christians, but they do not accept the Lord's Word. They do not understand the truth of Christianity. They doubt, misunderstand, and even mock and oppose it. They only want the name of Christianity; they do not want the truth of Christianity. They are Christians according to their own "theology," and not according to the Lord's Word. The Lord said, "It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life" (v. 63). When a man receives the Lord's word, he receives the Lord's life. One characteristic of the outward Christian is that he cannot understand and will not believe, receive, or treasure the Lord's Word. All of God's children have one fundamental feeling towards God's Word, the Bible. They believe, honor, and treasure God's Word. This feeling towards the Bible is the basic and fundamental attitude which a Christian ought to have. If a person calls himself a Christian, yet doubts, rather than believes the Bible, criticizes, rather than honors it, and tramples, rather than treasures it, he must not be a genuine Christian. Although the disciples who withdrew at the Lord's word were called disciples outwardly, in reality they were unbelievers. The Bible says clearly, "For Jesus knew from the beginning who were the ones who did not believe and who was the one who would betray Him" (v. 64). This kind of outward Christian either withdraws halfway or mixes in with the disciples only to eventually betray the Lord!</p><p>When the many so-called disciples were withdrawing, the Lord asked the twelve disciples: "Do you also want to go away?" Simon Peter answered and said, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have words of eternal life, and we have believed..." (vv. 67-69). Peter had received the revelation. The heavenly Father had revealed to him that Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of the living God. This is why he still followed the Lord when many withdrew. The Lord's word was like a yardstick which differentiated those who genuinely believed in Him from those who did not believe in Him. It separated the outward ones from the inward ones.</p><p>Christians who have revelation and who are Christians inwardly can withstand tests. They treasure God's truth and are not afraid of any trial. We see Paul suffering many persecutions and much tribulation for the sake of the Lord's name. One day he was brought in chains to Caesarea to be judged by Festus. Even Festus himself admitted that Paul did not commit any crime and that the only questions against him were about a certain Jesus who had died, whom Paul affirmed to be alive (Acts 25:18-19). Brothers and sisters, this is a sober question: Are you an outward Christian or an inward Christian? Paul had the experience; it pleased God to reveal His Son in him. This is why he insisted that Jesus was living when others said that He had died. Even when others held him in chains, he said the same thing. Even when others charged him with many false accusations, he said the same thing. On the way to Damascus, he had indeed met the Jesus who was raised from the dead. Therefore, he could present his good testimony under any trial.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, no outward Christian can withstand the test of the truth or the test of trials. I wish everyone who called himself a Christian would settle this question once and for all: Is the Christianity you know outward, or is it inward? Are you a Christian by tradition, by learning, or by revelation? Is your knowledge of the Lord Jesus in your head or in life and revelation? Is your Christianity something of man or something of God?</p><p>Finally, I will repeat again: "For he is not...who is one outwardly...But...who is one inwardly."</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">LIFE AND FEELING</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:4; Rom. 8:12; 1 Cor. 12:26</h1><p>Every life has feelings. God's life is also full of feelings. In man's view, life is something intangible and abstract. But feeling is something tangible and more concrete. No one can show you life, but you can know life by the feelings of life. It is difficult to present life to man in a concrete way or to point a finger at something and say, "This is life." We cannot show others something called life, nor can others show us something called life. But we can know life by the feelings of this life. Thank and praise the Lord, He has given us a life, and this life has feelings; it is a life that can be known by its feelings. Although we cannot show ourselves or others something called life, the fact that we have new feelings within us proves that we have a new life.</p><p>After a man receives the Lord, we say that he is not only saved but also regenerated. This means that he is born of God; he has received a new life from God. Yet this is something that is very difficult to explain. How does a person know that he has life? How do others know that he has the life of God? How does the church know that he has the life of God? The existence of God's life is proved by the feelings of this life. If God's life is in a person, the feelings of this life must also be in that person. What are the feelings of life? When a Christian is accidentally overcome by sin, he will feel sorrowful. This is a feeling of life. When he sins, he feels uneasy, and he feels a barrier between himself and God and loses his joy; these are all feelings of life. Because God's life hates sin, when a man possesses His life, he will surely have a feeling towards sin. When he has this feeling of life, it proves that he has life.</p><p>If a man confesses that he is a sinner and receives the Lord Jesus to be his Savior yet never has any feeling about sin, is he regenerated? Suppose a person has sinned, but only admits that he is wrong when someone goes to him and tells him that he has done wrong. After some time, suppose he commits another mistake, but asks why he cannot do something like that when he is asked about his mistake. Before he will say, "Yes, I was wrong," others have to tell him it is a sin. Shortly after this, suppose he does something else again, and others still have to go to him before he realizes that he was wrong. He may never reject their words, and he may be very obedient, but he does not have any feeling of his own. If a man does not have any feeling of his own and depends on others to feel for him, how can we say that he has the life of God? If he has the life of God, he ought to have feelings. It is impossible for a person to have God's life yet not have any feelings of God's life. This can never happen. God's life is not unsubstantial or abstract; it is very substantial. How do we know that it is substantial? We know because this life has feelings.</p><p>When a man has God's life, not only will he have feelings toward sin, but the life he possesses will also give him a knowledge about God. We have not received a spirit of slavery but a spirit of sonship. Spontaneously we feel that God is very approachable and that it is a sweet thing to call, "Abba, Father." "The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God" (Rom. 8:16). Our knowledge of the Father is a feeling of life. Some people only know doctrines; they have never contacted God. They are afraid of God and have never touched God. They do not have any relationship with God. The Spirit has not witnessed with their spirit that they are children of God. They cannot cry, "Abba, Father," from their spirit. They may pray, but in their prayers, they do not feel that sin is far from them or that God is near them. They do not feel the evil of sin nor the intimacy of God. These ones have never had a relationship with God; they have not received a new life from Him. They do not feel that God is near or that Christ has removed the barrier between them and God. They do not have the feeling that they are God's children. They say that they are Christians, but they do not have the proper feeling before God. They can call with their mouth, "Our Father in heaven," but they do not have that feeling within them. The existence of feeling proves the existence of life. If they never have this feeling, how can anyone say that they have this life?</p><p>The same thing can be said about the Body of Christ. Many brothers and sisters ask, "What do I have to do before I can say that I have seen the Body of Christ? How can we live out the Body life?" I answer them, "All those who know the life of the Body of Christ will have the feeling of the Body of Christ. If you have seen the Body, it is impossible for you not to have the feeling of the Body. If the life within you is a fact and an experience, this life will give you a feeling." We must see the Body of Christ not only as a principle or a doctrine but also as a matter of feeling.</p><p>First Corinthians 12:26 says, "And whether one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or one member is glorified, all the members rejoice with it." Suffering is a feeling, and joy is a feeling. Although there are many members, the life they have is one, and the feelings they have are also one. Some people have artificial limbs. Outwardly their limbs look much the same as real limbs. But artificial limbs do not have life and therefore do not have the feeling of the body. When other members suffer, an artificial limb does not suffer. When other members rejoice, the artificial limb does not feel anything. Other members have feelings because they have the same life. But the artificial limb does not have any feeling because it does not have life. Hence, it is impossible to imitate life, and there is no need to imitate life. If you have it, you have it, and there is no need to imitate it. If you do not have it, you do not have it, and even if you imitate, it will not look like the real thing. The most obvious manifestation of life is feeling. Once a Christian sees the life of the Body, he will immediately have the feeling of the Body and have the same feelings as other members.</p><p>In spiritual matters, it is useless to have teachings without feelings. Suppose a person hears that lying is a sin and an improper thing for a Christian to do. As a result he also tells others that lying is a sin and that he should not lie. But the question is not whether he says with his mouth that he should not lie. The question is whether or not he feels anything wrong within him when he lies. If he does not feel sinful when he lies, it is useless for him to say with his mouth that lying is a sin. He can say that it is wrong to lie while lying just the same. One characteristic of those who have God's life is feeling inwardly wrong when they lie. They do not have to understand doctrinally that lying is wrong; when they lie, they feel uneasy within. This is being a Christian. Being a Christian is being a person with life and feelings within. One characteristic of being a Christian is the feeling of life. A person who does not have life and who has no feelings within is not a Christian. Outward regulations are merely standards; they are not life. Suppose a man says, "I know the teaching about the Body; therefore, I should not act independently." This is not enough. Such a person must have the proper feeling within about this matter. If he says with his mouth that he should not act independently yet does not have any feeling within when he is acting independently, he has never seen the Body of Christ. This does not mean that he has never heard the teaching concerning the Body of Christ; it means that he has not seen the reality of the Body of Christ. Hearing the teaching of the Body of Christ and seeing the Body of Christ are two entirely different things. Hearing the teaching of the Body of Christ merely means understanding a principle outwardly. But when one sees the Body of Christ, he will have a different feeling within him. When one hears the teaching of salvation, he merely knows how God saves sinners. But when he receives the Lord Jesus as the Savior, he will have the feeling of sin and the feeling of God within him. Brothers and sisters, can you see the difference here? This is why we cannot neglect the feeling of life. (We are not speaking about outward conscious feelings but inward conscious feelings.) This feeling is the expression of life. The presence or absence of feeling is the test that shows whether or not we have something real within us; it shows whether we have the life of God within us.</p><p>One mark of the feeling of life is that we do not need anyone to tell us about anything; we have this knowledge within us spontaneously. If we have to wait for others to tell us about something, our response is too late. Suppose every Christian needed someone else to tell him what sin is, what he should do, and what he should not do. This would be terrible! What would happen when there was no one else to tell him what he should do? What would happen if others told him, and he forgot about it? A Christian does not act according to what others tell him. A life within, a light within, and a feeling within will tell him what to do. We should pay attention to the feelings within. These inner feelings come from God's enlightening and from life; they are not from man.</p><p>At the time we were regenerated, we received a real life. Therefore, we also have a real feeling. The reality of the feeling proves the reality of life. May the Lord be gracious to us so that we can touch the feeling of life and live by the feeling of life. May the Lord give us rich feelings so that we will have feelings for everything&mdash;feelings for sins, feelings for God, feelings for the Body of Christ, and feelings for all spiritual realities. May the Lord lead us on for the glory of His name!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX</h1><h1 class="title">THE FEELING<br />OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 12:3-5; 1 Cor. 12:25-27; Eph. 4:12-13, 15-16</h1><p>In the previous chapter, Life and Feeling, we saw that the presence of feelings proves the existence of life. In this chapter we want to go on to consider the meaning of the feeling of the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHERLY LOVE</h2><p>First let us consider love. One amazing thing about love is that the Bible says, "We know that we have passed out of death into life because we love the brothers" (1 John 3:14). All those who have passed from death into life love one another. All those who are members in the Body love one another. This love is produced by life and is spontaneous. You do not have to ask a person in the meeting whether he is a Christian, and if he says yes, you do not have to ask whether Christians should love one another. In the same way, he does not have to say that he will start loving other Christians just because you have told him so. This is not the way God's children behave. Everyone who is genuinely born of God has God's life. Those who are saved by God spontaneously love their fellow members. Whether or not a person has been told to love another one, he will have a feeling of love for his brothers. It is true that we often have to remind others to love their brothers. But these reminders will not supply what they do not already have; it will only make them more zealous for what they have. If love is there, it is there. If it is not there, it is not there. Once we meet one of God's people, we spontaneously love him. We cannot explain, but within there is such a feeling; within there is such a love.</p><p>A brother had a son. When others asked him, "Now that you are a father, do you love your son?", he answered, "A week before I became a father, I kept wondering how I could love my son. But the minute my son was born, my heart spontaneously went out to him when I saw him, and I loved him." Love is an inner feeling; it is something produced from the inside, rather than something taught from the outside. Every child of God who is redeemed by the Lord's blood, who has received the Lord's life, and who is baptized into the Body of Christ spontaneously loves his fellow members. Many times we meet someone who genuinely belongs to the Lord. It does not matter whether he is from far away or from the same city or whether he is cultured or uncultured. It does not matter what nationality he has or what job he occupies. The minute we find out that he is a Christian, spontaneously there is a love for him. Love is a feeling of life. As long as we are in the Body, we will have this feeling.</p><h2 class="head1">NO DIVISION</h2><p>Those who have seen the Body of Christ have a feeling for the Body of Christ. Once they do anything sectarian or anything that divides God's children from one another, they feel uneasy inside. Since they love all those who belong to God, they cannot divide God's children from one another. In the Body, love is something spontaneous, while division is something unnatural. A man has two hands, and it would not matter how many things one hand said against the other hand, the two hands can never be separated from each other; it is impossible to divide the two. Some think that as long as they have left the sects, they know the Body of Christ. But in reality, leaving the sects does not necessarily mean that one has seen the Body of Christ. Those who have seen the Body of Christ will surely forsake the sects, but it does not follow that those who have left the sects have seen the Body of Christ. Many people have outwardly left a sect, but actually they build up another sect for themselves. Their leaving of a sect is only an attempt to accentuate their "distinctiveness"; they do not see that all the members are our brothers and are equally lovable. All sectarian spirits, all divisive attitudes, and all outward moves and inward thoughts that cause separations between God's children are proof of the lack of vision concerning the Body of Christ.</p><p>The Body of Christ will deliver us from the sects as well as from sectarianism. It will deliver us from ourselves as well as from individualism. Many people do not live according to the principle of the Body. Rather, they live according to the principle of individualism. This individualism can be found everywhere. In the prayer meetings, some can only pray by themselves; they cannot pray with others. Their bodies may be kneeling down with others, but in their feeling they are praying by themselves. They can only have others listening to their prayers; they cannot listen to the prayers of others. They do not respond to the prayers of others and cannot say amen to them. They do not join themselves to the feelings of others. They pray according to their way and leave others to pray according to their way. It seems as if their prayers are totally unrelated to the prayers of others. When they come to the meetings, they only care to speak their part. Then they have nothing more to do with the others; whatever prayer, burden, or feelings others may have seem to be totally unrelated to them. This is the principle of individualism; it is not the principle of the Body. Such ones do not see the Body, and they cannot work together with others before the Lord. Sometimes when three, five, ten, or twenty brothers are speaking together, you can sense that some of them can only speak about their own burden; they have no heart to speak or hear about the burdens of others. If you sit down with them for an hour or two, the only time they are alert is when they are talking about their own affairs. When the subject is about other people, they begin to wander around in their mind. If you talk to them afterwards, you will find that they did not hear a single thing that the others said. These small indications tell us whether or not a man has seen the Body of Christ.</p><p>Individualism can develop from one individual to a few individuals. In the church, sometimes we see three or five people, or eight or nine people being knitted together into a tight circle. Only the few within the circle are one with each other and can love each other. All the other brothers and sisters do not fit in. This proves that these ones have not seen the Body of Christ. There is only one Body of Christ; there cannot be several Bodies. If a man sees the Body of Christ, he cannot have any form of individualism; he cannot form parties and cannot have his little circles. If you see the Body of Christ, you will detect individualism as soon as it appears. You will sense that it is wrong, and spontaneously you will not dare to move in that direction. When you and a few others try to do something by yourselves, the Body-consciousness will tell you that you are not blended in with the other children of God. This Body-consciousness will not let you go; it will nag you, speak to you, rebuke you, hinder you, and tell you that you are wrong. This feeling of life will deliver you from all forms of divisions.</p><h2 class="head1">DELIVERANCE FROM INDIVIDUALISTIC WORKS</h2><p>If we have Body-consciousness, we immediately will see that the Body is one. Once we see this, we will not be individualistic in our spiritual work. If we want to participate in the Lord's work, we need to deal with this one matter&mdash;individualistic works. Some people can only do things well when they are doing it alone. If they cannot do it alone, they cannot do it well. They only regard the things that they are doing as having any spiritual value, and what others do has no spiritual value at all. When they preach and no one is saved, they feel sorry. When others preach and some are saved, they feel strange. This is being individualistic in one's work. Whenever God's children see the oneness of the Body, they will also see the oneness of the work, and they will be delivered out of individualistic work into the work of the Body. This does not mean that we no longer work by ourselves. It means that we no longer consider any work to be our own. It does not matter whether a work is done by us or not, as long as someone is doing it, we are satisfied.</p><p>After we become Christians, we should have a desire for spiritual things and seek after them. But this does not mean that we should have a competitive and ambitious spirit, much less a spirit of jealousy. The proper attitude in the work is this: We should hope that whatever we can do, others can do the same as well, and that whatever we cannot do ourselves, others will be raised up to do it. It is hoping that both we and others can do better. We can only be used as a vessel in the work; we cannot take over the work; we cannot claim the work and the result of the work as our own. If we think that something can only be done by us, we have not seen the Body. If we see the Body, we will see that the result is all for the benefit of the Head and the Body, whether we or others are doing it. All the glory goes to the Lord, and all the blessings go to the church.</p><p>The Lord has assigned a portion to each one of us. We should not consider ourselves greater than what we are. We should be faithful to the portion that the Lord has assigned to us, and we should honor the portion that the Lord has assigned to others. Many young people are always comparing themselves with others; they say that they have this and that, and that others do not have this and that. Or they say that they do not have this and that, and that others have this and that. Actually, it is impossible to make such comparisons. It is like adding a chair to a table and asking whether it is two or one. A table plus a chair is just a table plus a chair. If you ask whether the hands are better or the eyes are better, I can only say that both are good. Those who see the Body will see that all the members have their functions; they will see that they are only one of the many members. They will not place themselves in a conspicuous position and make comparisons with others or usurp their places.</p><p>Once a Christian sees the Body, it will be impossible for him to be proud or jealous anymore. Since the Body is one, it will be the same if the work is done by others or by ourselves; there will be no difference at all. Whether the work is done by you or by others, the glory ultimately goes to the Lord alone, and the blessings go to the church. If you see the Body of Christ, spontaneously you will have this feeling within you. You will sense that the Body is one and that the work is also one.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF FELLOWSHIP</h2><p>Those who see the Body will spontaneously see the need of fellowship. They will spontaneously see that they cannot act independently. Fellowship is not a formal acquaintance but a spontaneous issue of the life of the Body. The common notion of fellowship among God's children is to visit a brother or a sister when we are free and chat with them a little. For most people this is fellowship. But fellowship really means a realization that we cannot go on alone, that we need to do everything together, with other members and with the Body as a whole. Although we cannot have all the brothers and sisters in the whole church come together, we can have two or three brothers come together and work according to the principle of the Body. We have to learn the principle of fellowship when we pray. We have to learn to fellowship when we encounter difficulties, and we have to learn to fellowship when we are seeking God's will, when we are not clear about our future, and when we do not understand God's Word. Fellowship means I cannot pray by myself, that I have to find two or three brothers to deal with a matter together. It means that I do not understand God's will by myself and that I seek to understand it together with two or three brothers. It means that I am confused about my own future and that I seek fellowship and I consider my future together with two or three other brothers and sisters. It means that I do not understand God's Word by myself and that I find two or three brothers to study God's Word together with me. Fellowship is to acknowledge that we are short, that we are inadequate, and that we need the Body. Fellowship is the acknowledgment of our own limitations and of the possibility of making mistakes by ourselves; it is receiving help from those who have spiritual discernment before the Lord. (This does not mean to ask for help only from those who are affectionate towards us.) I cannot go on by myself; I need the help of other brothers and sisters. The Body of Christ is a matter of life, and this life has feelings. This feeling will tell you that without fellowship, you cannot go on.</p><h2 class="head1">ON BEING A MEMBER</h2><p>Once a person has a feeling for the Body, he will see his place in the Body at the same time. In other words, he will see that he is only a member in the Body. Every member has its use. A member is different from a cell. A body can survive without a cell, but it cannot survive without a member. Of course, every cell has its use too. But the Bible tells us that we are members in the Body of Christ; we are not cells in the Body of Christ. Unfortunately, many Christians are like cells in the Body; they do not act like members. They do not have any specific function in the Body of Christ, and they never take care of their responsibility. It seems that their presence in the meeting is not indispensable and that nothing is missing when they are not there. They do not function in the Body because they have never seen the Body. They never realize their ministry when they are among the brothers and sisters. They do not see what they should do. If they see the Body, they will spontaneously see that they are members; they will realize that unless they minister life to the Body of Christ, the Body will suffer. Brothers and sisters, none of us can be a passive member in the Body. As long as we are a member of the Body, we cannot be passive, and we cannot be a bystander in the meetings. When we come to the meeting, we should realize that we are a member in the Body of Christ and that we have to pray. They may be audible prayers or silent prayers. But we must at least pray and minister life to the Body. Some Christians are suppliers of life; once they come to a meeting, the meeting receives their supply even when they do not open their mouth to speak. Their very presence is a life supply to others. Wherever they go, death is swallowed up. Brothers and sisters, once we see the Body of Christ, we will inevitably see ourselves as members.</p><p>We are members of the Body of Christ. As members severally of this Body, we should seek to profit the Body. We should seek for ways to supply life and power to the Body. Even if we do not open our mouth in the meeting, we should pray silently, and even if we do not speak, we should always be looking to God. This is being Body-conscious. Once we see the Body, we will no longer say that we are dispensable or unimportant. Once we see the Body, we will say that we are a member of the Body and that we have a responsibility to fulfill. We should speak, and we should pray. When we come to the meeting, we will do whatever God tells us to do. We cannot be a bystander. Brothers and sisters, if we see the Body, we will not act in any other way. When we function this way, the life of the meeting will swallow up all death. Many meetings do not have enough power because the presence of death is too strong; there are too many bystanders in these meetings.</p><h2 class="head1">SUBMISSION TO AUTHORITY</h2><p>If you see the Body of Christ, you will also have the sensation that you are under the authority of the Head. You will feel that God's children are lovable, that division is wrong, and that fellowship is vital. You will also feel that as a member of the Body of Christ, there are responsibilities that you have to fulfill. These feelings are feelings of the Body. At the same time, once you feel that you are in the Body, you will feel that you are under the Head. Those who feel that they are in the Body also feel that they are under the Head. If a man knows the life of the Body of Christ, and if he is conscious of the fact that he is a member, he will also be conscious of the authority of the Head.</p><p>Moreover, we must submit not only to the direct authority of the Head, but also to the indirect authority of the Head. My arms are not only under the authority of my head; when my shoulders move, my arms move with them also. My arms submit to the Head by submitting to the shoulders. Those who see the Body of Christ surely see the need for submission to God's appointed authorities in the Body of Christ.</p><p>Sometimes someone will tell you to do something, and after you pray about it, you may feel that the Lord does not want you to do it. When you act accordingly and put the matter aside, you feel happy; you feel that you have obeyed the Lord's word and that it was right for you not to listen to man. But more than once have you not felt that when you ignored the words of others, you were actually disobeying the Lord? More than once have you not felt that a person or a few persons really knew the Lord, and that the Lord had put them there to represent His authority, and that if you went against them, you would be going against the Lord? If you see the Body and see the authority of the Head, you will see that there are always one or more persons who are ahead of you in the Body, to whom you should submit yourself. Not only must you see the Head, you must also see those who represent the Head and realize that going against them is going against God.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, if the Lord opens your eyes, you will see the Body, and you will see authority. Why do the different parts of the human body always work harmoniously together? The body is always one because there is authority in the body. If the body is not upheld by authority, all the members will be in confusion. Suppose the stomach is hungry and wants to eat, yet the mouth refuses to cooperate and to take in the food. Can the body still survive? As long as one part of the body rejects the authority of the body, the whole body will become sick. Cancerous tumors are dangerous diseases. These tumors grow when some cells of the body do not follow the law of the body and begin to grow independently. The body does not need such growth, yet they continue to grow. They take away much of the nourishment of the body for their own growth. They only care for their own growth and do not care whether the body wants them to grow. They do not submit to the authority of the body, and they act independently. The more they grow, the more damage the body suffers. In the end, a few insubordinate cells can kill the whole body. Authority is the law of the body, while insubordination is a disease in the body. If a man does not know authority, how can he say that he knows the Body of Christ? When three or five people come together, those who know the Body can always find who the authority is and to whom they should submit. Everyone has his authority to whom he should submit. The hands submit to the arms, while the arms submit to the shoulders. This is something very spontaneous and comely. Even if there are only three or five persons, if they practice this, they will see the Body of Christ manifested among them.</p><p>Many Christians speak carelessly and act carelessly. They do not listen to others, and they think that they themselves are the greatest; it seems as if they have never found anyone to whom they can submit. This proves that they have never been restricted by the Body, and they have never submitted themselves to the authority of the Head. May the Lord be merciful to these ones. If we are truly dealt with by the Lord, if our flesh is truly touched, and if the "backbone" of our natural life is truly broken, we will immediately see that our hands and our mouth can no longer be free. The Body will restrict us, and we will no longer be able to rebel against God's appointed authority.</p><p>May the Lord deliver us from mere doctrines. May the Lord lead us on to a full knowledge of the Body of Christ. May this feeling follow us all the time so that we no longer act according to our own will or live foolishly or carelessly. If we do this, we will receive a rich supply from the Body, and through the Body we will express the Lord's testimony on the earth.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">PLEASING THE LORD</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gal. 1:6-10; 1 Thes. 2:4; 2 Cor. 5:9</h1><p>Every servant of God must have a fundamental attitude of pleasing the Lord. In Galatians 1:10 Paul said, "Am I seeking to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a slave of Christ." When Paul spoke this word, on the one hand, he was very grieved because the Galatian believers had turned away from his gospel so soon, and on the other hand, this word expressed his serious attitude towards the Lord. When Paul went to Galatia the first time to preach the gospel, he told the people there that a man is saved by the grace of the Lord and that salvation is through faith and not through the law. At that time, many believed in the Lord. They loved Paul so much that they were willing to pluck out their eyes and give them to him (4:15). But later another group of men came and told the Galatians that it was not enough to believe and have grace; one must be perfected by the law as well (3:1-3). Hence, Paul warned them seriously, "But if even we or an angel out of heaven should announce to you a gospel beyond that which we have announced to you, let him be accursed" (1:8). The Galatians were deeply deceived by these people. Even while Paul was struggling to defend the truth of the gospel, they became dissatisfied with him. This forced Paul to say, "For am I now trying to win the assent of men or of God? Or am I seeking to please men?" (1:10). "So then have I become your enemy by presenting the truth to you?" (4:16). Brothers and sisters, one fundamental desire of a servant of God is to please Him. If Paul was willing to compromise a little and not be strict with the Lord's gospel, agreeing that salvation is not only by faith, but also through the law and according to one's work, he would have sacrificed the truth in exchange for the approval of the Galatians and would have won their favor. If he had done this, he would not have had to pay any price. But he could not do this, nor would he do this. He could not be unfaithful to the Lord. He did not care for man's "face"; instead he rebuked them soberly saying, "O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly portrayed crucified?" (3:1). "You have been brought to nought, separated from Christ, you who are being justified by law; you have fallen from grace" (5:4).</p><p>Paul's attitude should be the attitude of every servant of God. Who are the servants of God? Many people think that the preachers of the gospel and the teachers of the truth are the servants of God and that other believers are not the servants of God. But what does the Bible say? The Bible tells us that all of God's redeemed ones are servants of God. Every child of God is a servant of God. In Leviticus 25:55 God says, "For the sons of Israel are servants to Me; they are My servants, whom I brought out from the land of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God." This tells us clearly that as long as a person was an Israelite and was brought out of Egypt, he was a servant of God. Not only were Moses and Joshua the servants of God, but all the Israelites who were led out of Egypt were the servants of God as well. As long as we are saved and as long as we are children of God, we are servants of God. We need two kinds of understanding about the blood of the Lord, and we need two kinds of knowledge about the Lord Himself. The blood of the Lord Jesus washes away our sins. At the same time, His blood also purchases us. The Lord Jesus is our Savior. At the same time, He is also our Lord. We have to see that Jesus is our Lord and we are His servants; we are purchased by His blood. We need to have a thorough knowledge concerning the Lord's right over us, and we ought to live for Him. All those who have truly seen the love of the cross have a love for the Lord in their hearts. If a man truly loves the Lord, there will surely be an expression of love; he will surely try to please the Lord.</p><p>Why do some Christians not please the Lord? A big reason is that they love the glory of men more than the glory of God. John 12 shows us that many of the rulers believed in the Lord, yet because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him so that they would not be put out of the synagogue (v. 42). They dared not become Christians openly. The problem with them was that they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God (v. 43). Brothers and sisters, are we like this? Do we love the glory of men more than the glory of God? Some Christians dare not confess the name of the Lord Jesus in public. They dare not say that they are Christians in public, and they dare not give thanks for their meals in public. They have long ceased living a life of praying and studying the Word, and they have long ceased meeting with Christians. Why? This is because they are afraid of men's mocking. They do not want others to say that they are superstitious. They love the glory of men more than the glory of God. Brothers and sisters, if you truly love the Lord, you will surely want to please Him. If you really want to please Him, you cannot love the glory of men more than the glory of God.</p><p>A Christian who pleases the Lord is faithful to the Lord. He should also be faithful to His truth. In upholding the truth, Paul ignored all opposition from men. He said, "So then have I become your enemy by presenting the truth to you?" (Gal. 4:16). He would rather suffer mistreatment from others than discount the truth. He would rather sacrifice himself than sacrifice the truth. He would rather see himself suffer than see the truth suffer.</p><p>In the past, many Christians have paid a great price to adhere to the Scripture in everything, to accept everything that is scriptural and to reject everything that is unscriptural. Brothers and sisters, if you compromise a little, you will suffer less attack and mockery. But if you are going to stand for the truth, you cannot avoid difficulty, and you cannot evade the price.</p><p>A brother once saw the meaning of baptism from the Bible, and he wanted to be baptized. But his father would not agree to it. He struggled in his heart very much. If he went ahead with his baptism, he would hurt his father's heart. But if he was not baptized, he would betray the Lord's command. While he was tossing and turning on his bed and being tormented by such thoughts, the Lord gave him a word: "He who loves father or mother above Me is not worthy of Me" (Matt. 10:37). It immediately became a matter to him of paying the price. Was he going to please his parents, or was he going to please God? Thank the Lord! The Lord's love conquered him, and he was baptized. This brother's story tells us one thing: If we are to please the Lord, we have to obey His truth in an absolute way. If Paul compromised a little with the Galatian believers, if he made some concessions and was not absolute with the truth, and if he said a few ambiguous words, he could have won the favor of the Galatians. But Paul reckoned the cost. He would not please men at any cost; he would only please God. Otherwise, he would not be a servant of God. He would rather become their enemy than withhold the truth from them.</p><p>Proverbs 23:23 says, "Buy the truth, and sell it not;/also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding." Truth is something that we have to buy; it is something that has a price. If we want to please the Lord and stand for the truth, we have to pay the price. If we are clear about the truth, we have to obey it all the way. Many Christians cannot pay the price because they want to please men; they try to dodge the truth. Brothers and sisters, we can only buy the truth; we cannot sell the truth. At the same time, truth can never be changed. Truth is like a pillar in a house. A pillar is not like a window or a door, which can be enlarged or reduced at will. A pillar cannot be moved; it cannot be made higher or lower, and it cannot be tilted. In other words, truth can never be changed. If we cannot pay the price to obey any part of the truth, we can only condemn ourselves and confess our weakness; we cannot lower the standard of the truth just because we cannot make it or because it creates dire consequences for us. If we lower it, we will bear serious responsibility before the Lord.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, we have seen that all of God's children are His servants. The Lord's Word tells us that a slave is not greater than his master (John 15:20). Whatever pathway our Lord took on earth, we have to take the same one. We have to suffer everything that He suffered on earth. If we acknowledge that we are His slaves, we should have a fundamental attitude of pleasing Him. If we do not settle this question, sooner or later we will not be able to go on in this way. Countless numbers of people have fallen by the wayside because they love man's glory more than God's glory. Brothers and sisters, human glory has a very deep influence on us. We have to go through countless lessons and dealings before this will be purged out of our system. From the day man ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he has had a fundamental problem within&mdash;he loves the glory of men. Every one of us has his own throne, and this throne is built upon the glory of men. But if we want to be faithful servants of the Lord, we have to resign our throne. Otherwise, we cannot serve our Lord. Hebrews 12:2 says that the Lord Jesus despised shame and chose the cross. Brothers and sisters, the cross is not just death, but shame. A clear mark that the cross has done a breaking work in a person is that he is no longer afraid of shame. Many Christians fail because they are afraid of shame. They love men's glory and are not willing to renounce their throne. Brothers and sisters, do not think that we are born humble and meek. We do not know how proud we are! We do not realize how much God's grace has to work in us before we will come down from our throne and before we will be delivered from the glory of men. May the Lord grant us the mercy to have a heart that pleases Him so that by His grace we can be faithful servants, looking forward to the day when, at the reckoning before the Lord's judgment seat, we will hear His voice saying, "Well done, good and faithful servant!"</p></body></html>
