   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE DOCTRINE OF BALAAM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND THE NICOLAITANS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>From the church at Ephesus we go on to the church at Pergamos.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here in Pergamos we have the second step.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All the steps are continuations: step follows step.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you take the first step, surely you will take the second step.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And the second step is composed of two main items: 1 the doctrine of Balaam, 2 the doctrine of the Nicolaitans.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What is the doctrine of Balaam?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Balaam was a prophet who worked for money.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, his preaching, his teaching, just became a job.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was due to the excess of labor and work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the church has an overabundance of labor and work, people surely will be hired to perform it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we love the Lord first and foremost, not caring so much for the work, we need hire no one.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The danger in Christianity has been and still is that of paying too much attention to the work without the love.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, so many Christian workers must be hired.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the church, all those who work for the Lord should do so not for money, but out of an intimate and burning love for the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should serve the Lord because His love is burning within us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We simply love Him; we would like to give every drop of blood for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We want to serve Him, but this does not mean a kind of work or labor, but an expression of love.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We care nothing for money.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christianity is involved in altogether too much work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"Let us organize something," they say.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"Let us open a mission field; let us send out so many missionaries; let us go to the seminaries and Bible institutes and solicit their graduates."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is just the doctrine of Balaam.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Those who are hired, of course, must do the work according to their money.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, the service of the Lord is commercialized.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is not only religion, but something worse.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If any of us ever conceive of hiring someone in the church to accomplish some task, we are taking the second step in forming a new religion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whenever we talk about money, we are well on our way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let us not talk about how many dollars we have, but about how many drops of blood we have.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We would not work for money, but for the love of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We care not for the abundance of money or the lack of money.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We serve for the love of Jesus not with dollars, but with drops of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we serve with a consideration of money we can never do the work of love.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we go out without money, but prepared to shed our blood for the love of Jesus, we will raise up a church with the first and best love, a church which could never afford anything to form a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How is it that Christianity today has become such a dreadful religion?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Just because of the matter of money, the doctrine of Balaam.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Inevitably following the doctrine of Balaam is the doctrine of the Nicolaitans.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The word "Nicolaitan" comes from two words in Greek, niko and laos.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The word niko means to conquer or subdue, while laos means people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Put together, these two words mean to subdue the people, or in other words, the clergy-laity system.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because the service of the Lord has been commercialized, the clergy-laity system spontaneously appears.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This system annuls the function of so many members and kills the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is a great evil.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It has been developed to such an extent in some places that if any of the laity should pray, he would certainly be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is religion at its worst.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Nothing offends the Lord so much as the clergy-laity system.</S>
