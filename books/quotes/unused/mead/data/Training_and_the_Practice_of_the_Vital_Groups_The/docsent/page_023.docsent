   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>2 Tim 1:6.</S>

   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How many times?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do you keep your repenting prayer continuously?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Have you and your companion made a name list of all your possible candidates?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Have you all prayed for your candidates and received the Lord's leading concerning whom you should contact?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have been speaking concerning the God-ordained way for a number of years.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now we are burdened to get into the practice of it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this message we want to consider the condition of our vital group today by responding to eight questions.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I. HAVE YOU STARTED YOUR VITAL GROUP?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first question we need to answer is: "Have you started your vital group?"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I trust that we have done something to start our vital group.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to practice the items of the God-ordained way so that we can do them in a consistent way with longevity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we want to do anything with longevity, we should not practice it in an extreme way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since we want to spend a time with the Lord every morning, we should always rise up at a certain proper time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we rise up too early, we will eventually not be able to keep it up.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I do not want to see anyone doing anything in an overly excited way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I have been serving the Lord as a slave and taking care of the saints for many years, and I have found out that excitement means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Everyone who is overly excited dies quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we can pray for fifteen minutes every morning, we should simply do that much.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we try to rise earlier or do anything more than this, it will not last long.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We pointed out that we need to go to the Lord individually to be stirred up in the first love for the Lord through repenting prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to make a thorough confession to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In our time with the Lord, we may say with tears, "Lord, I repent.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I'm so sinful and dirty."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I have been practicing this for close to seventy years.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We all have to learn the lesson in our prayer not to teach the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Mostly we should not ask the Lord to do something for us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead, we should cry out desperately from the depths of our being, "Lord, I'm sinful!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I need You, Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Bible even says that some beat their breast when they made their confession to the Lord Luke 18:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you are so sincere, honest, and faithful to the Lord, when someone asks you about your repentance, you might immediately begin to shed some tears.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You would still be in the sensation of how sinful you are.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Every sinner who gets saved should repent.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There are many degrees of people's repentance: Some repent shallowly and superficially.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Others repent more deeply.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Still others repent to the uttermost in a desperate and thorough way from the depths of their being.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They may even beat their breast or roll on the floor while they are repenting and confessing to the Lord.</S>
