TO THE HUMAN ELEMENT</h2>
<p>When a person is possessed by a demon, the function of his mind, emotion, and will are annulled. When God mingles with a person, He does not annul the human element. God wants man&rsquo;s mind, emotion, and will to cooperate with Him. Hence, the more spiritual we become, the richer our mind, emotion, and will become. A spiritual person is more human because his human element is enriched with the divine element. Such a person is moved by the Spirit. Furthermore, God flows through such a person and mingles with him. What that person says or does is according to the proper standard of humanity. His personality is not annulled; rather, it is strengthened.</p>
<p>According to his biography, Andrew Murray&rsquo;s mind, emotion, and will were enriched, yet he was also firm and resolute. His thoughts touched God&rsquo;s mind, his affection touched God&rsquo;s emotion, and his will touched God&rsquo;s intention. Other spiritual giants were the same. They did not lose their human nature, but they stopped being independent of God. Genuine fellowship does not cause a person to cease to exist. On the contrary, he becomes more active. However, he no longer does things by himself. He depends on God and touches God&rsquo;s feeling in everything he does.</p>
<p>A lethargic person who sleeps all the time is cowardly and cannot be spiritual. A spiritual person must be sober and sound. He will have rich thoughts, fervent emotions, and a strong, resolute will. He will depend on God, and his revelation, insight, and understanding will not be independent of God. He will be subject to God, depend on God, and let God be mingled with him. Hence, the divine element will be in his mind, emotion, and will. For this reason, his speaking, decisions, and wisdom will be God&rsquo;s speaking, decisions, and wisdom.</p>
<p>Two brothers may be intelligent, but one brother can have the flavor of God while the other does not. Two sisters might lose their temper, but one sister expresses God while the other expresses her flesh. An elder might speak a harsh word of rebuke, and yet others sense the flavor of God. We can discern the difference in such cases.</p>
<p>We should not think that when we fellowship with God, our person ceases to exist. If a person ceases to exist, it is likely that he is possessed by a demon. When we learn to fellowship with the Lord, we learn to use our mind, emotion, and will properly and to subject them to God. If a thought causes a sister to feel dry, empty, or restless, she should reject it and think of something else. If another thought gives her light and comfort, she should receive it, because it is of life. If a brother who is ready to give a message feels bothered within, that is God&rsquo;s prohibition. He should seek the Lord until he feels bright and refreshed. This should be our practice even when we select hymns for a meeting.</p>
<p>We do not cease to have thoughts when we fellowship with the Lord. On the contrary, we are full of thoughts. However, we do not depend on our thoughts but on the sense of life in our spirit&mdash;the sense given to us by God. When we subject our thoughts to the sense in our spirit, we are subjecting our mind to God and are being mingled with Him. Our love for others should be according to the sense in our spirit. It is not that we are without emotions. We are full of emotions, but our emotions are subject to the sense in our spirit. This also applies to our will. Our spirit should be the dominant part of our being. If our spirit is subject to God, our whole being will also be subject to God. This is the way to touch the presence of God in our walk. This is to live in fellowship. Then what we say and do will have the divine element, express God, and supply life. As those who desire to be used by God, this is the most basic lesson that we should learn.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LETTING GOD FLOW THROUGH<br />
EVERY PART OF OUR BEING</h2>
<p>The proper meaning of fellowship is that God flows into man as life in order for man to be mingled with Him. God is Spirit, and we have a human spirit. The Spirit has entered into us in order to be our life. Before man&rsquo;s fall, the human spirit was his dominant organ; it governed and directed him. His mind, emotion, and will, with their various functions, were under the direction of his spirit. The actions of his body were also under the direction of his spirit. Although he was not indwelt by the Spirit, his human spirit was able to communicate with God. Although God was outside of man, He could direct the spirit within man. Hence, man lived before God and was under God&rsquo;s control. From the human viewpoint, this condition seems to be good enough. For this reason, many Christians think that God&rsquo;s salvation is merely to bring us back to man&rsquo;s original condition. It has not occurred to them that God&rsquo;s salvation exceeds bringing man back to his original condition. God&rsquo;s purpose is to be one with us by entering into our spirit, dwelling in our spirit, and being mingled with us. Thus, God desires to direct and govern our entire being. Not only so, He desires to spread from our spirit into every part of our being.</p>
<p>God in His salvation desires not only to rule over us but also to be mingled with us. This mingling begins with our spirit until it reaches every part of our being. God first enters into our spirit to become one spirit with us. Then from our spirit He spreads into our soul&mdash;our mind, emotion, and will. God mingles with our mind, emotion, and will so that our mind expresses His thoughts, our emotion expresses His feelings, and our will expresses His decisions.</p>
<p>To fellowship with God is to let Him operate and work freely in our spirit so that He can reach our mind, emotion, and will. His spreading requires that our mind, emotion, and will be subject to our spirit. God is already mingled with and joined to our spirit as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). Hence, when our mind, emotion, and will are subject to our spirit, they are also subject to God. If we allow our spirit to rule over us, that is, to direct our mind, emotion, and will, the Spirit will flow into every part of our being. This flow is fellowship. When we fellowship with God, we let Him flow from our spirit to every part of our being.</p>
<p>When our mind, emotion, and will make a move that is not under the ruling of our spirit, our fellowship with God is broken. When the flow stops, the fellowship is lost. Once we lose the fellowship, we lose God&rsquo;s presence. This is serious. We should be in fear and trembling so that we would not allow our mind, emotion, and will to bypass the ruling of our spirit. The Spirit is able to flow freely within our being when our mind, emotion, and will are subject to the ruling of our spirit. As a result, we will remain in fellowship with God and enjoy His presence, and God will be mingled with us and spread to every part of our inner being. Furthermore, He will flow out of our inner being, and the element of God will be seen in our living and walk. At this time, the divine element will be mingled with our human element.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Fellowshipping with the Lord for the Mingling of God with Man &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
