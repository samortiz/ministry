<h1 class="title">THE PROOF OF GOD&rsquo;S EXISTENCE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Acts 14:15-17; Psa. 19; Rom. 1:20</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The existence of God
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God exists in the universe.</li>
	<li>God exists in human living.</li>
	<li>God exists in the thoughts of man.</li>
	<li>God exists in human conversation. The fact that people talk about God&rsquo;s existence or non-existence is a proof that God exists.</li>
	<li>God exists in the dictionary. The fact that every dictionary has the word &ldquo;God&rdquo; is a proof that God exists.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The proof of God&rsquo;s existence
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The creation of the universe proves that God exists.</li>
	<li>The very operation of nature proves that God exists. Consider the showers from heaven, the growth of produce from the earth, and the distance between the sun and the earth that keeps a suitable climate for human living.</li>
	<li>Human psychological faculties prove that God exists. For instance, within man there is the capacity for joy. Psalm 16:11 says &ldquo;...in Thy presence is fullness of joy...&rdquo; This verse shows that man&rsquo;s capacity to be filled with joy is related to God. Whatever God does in this universe is to make man full of joy. Friends, today is your joy full? If not, your lack of joy shows that you do not have God. If you are full of joy, that shows that you have received Him and proves that God exists.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>What should you do with God?
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Confess that you are far from Him, that you are sinful, and that you come short of His glory.</li>
	<li>Repent and turn back to Him.</li>
	<li>Receive the Son of God, Jesus Christ, as your Savior.</li>
	<li>Through Christ enjoy and serve God in spirit.</li>
	</ol></li>
