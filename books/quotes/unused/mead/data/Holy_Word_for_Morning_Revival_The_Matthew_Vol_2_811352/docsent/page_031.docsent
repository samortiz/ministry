   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 10 DAY 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 13:31-32</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>31 Another parable He set before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>32 And which is smaller than all the seeds; but when it has grown, it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and roost in its branches.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord arranged the parables in Matthew 13 in a very good sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First we have the parable of the sower, who sows the seed to bring forth the constituents of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then we have the parable of the tares sown by the enemy, the false ones among the constituents that cause the kingdom of the heavens to become Christendom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Following the parable of the tares, we have the parable of the mustard seed 13:31-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 31 says, "The kingdom of the heavens is like a mustard seed."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The fruit of the wheat in the first two parables and the fruit of the mustard seed here in the third parable are for food.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This indicates that the kingdom people, the constituents of the kingdom and the church, should be like a crop that produces food for the satisfaction of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Both wheat and mustard are good for food.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, in both the second and third parables we see the thought of the evil one, the subtlety of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The evil one came in to sow tares among the wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As any farmer can tell you, tares greatly frustrate the growth of the wheat because they exhaust the fertility of the soil which is meant to nourish the growing wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because the soil has been exhausted, wasted, by the tares, the wheat cannot grow properly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We may apply this to our present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Wherever there are many false believers, it is difficult for the real believers to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the subtlety of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As we will see, the subtlety of the enemy with respect to the mustard seed is to cause it to grow into a huge tree that is no longer good for food.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 32 says that after the mustard seed has grown, "It is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church, which is the embodiment of the kingdom, should be like an herb that produces food.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, its nature and function were changed, so that it became a "tree," a lodging place for birds.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is against the law of God's creation, that is, that every plant must be after its kind Gen 1:11-12.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This change happened in the first part of the fourth century, when Constantine the Great mixed the church with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He brought thousands of false believers into Christianity, making it Christendom, no longer the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, this third parable corresponds with the third of the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, the church in Pergamos 2:12-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The mustard is an annual herb, whereas the tree is a perennial plant.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church, according to its heavenly and spiritual nature, should be like the mustard, sojourning on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But with its nature changed, the church became deeply rooted and settled as a tree in the earth, flourishing with its enterprises as the branches in which many evil persons and things are lodged.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This resulted in the formation of the outward organization of the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 32 also says that the birds of heaven come and roost in the branches of this tree.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Instead of producing foodstuff, this tree is a roost for birds.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because the birds in the first parable signify the evil one, Satan vv.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>4, 19 , the birds of heaven in verse 32 must refer to Satan's evil spirits with the evil persons and things motivated by them see Rev 18:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They lodge in the branches of the great tree, that is, in the enterprises of Christendom.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The birds refer to the evil one and to evil persons, evil matters, and evil things in short to all evil pertaining to the evil one.</S>
