From the Bible we see that the relationship between God and man, whether before man's fall or after man's fall, is a matter of the spirit
He became flesh to be a man, passed through human living, entered into death, came out of death, and entered into resurrection
In Acts He is no longer just God, but the God-man, possessing divinity with humanity and having divinity within His humanity
These two great things opened up the way for Him to enter into fallen sinners, even into you and me, who still had sin within us
The Spirit of God is not only the Spirit of the Triune God, but also the Spirit of the consummated and completed Triune God
Today He is lacking in nothing, for in Him there is divinity, humanity, incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection
If you want to know how to experience God as your life, you must know all the things concerning God and man mentioned above
If we read the context of Romans 8:10 carefully, we will see that the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and Christ are just one
A student's main purpose in attending school is not to learn rules or wear uniforms, but to be prepared and equipped academically
If he studies medicine, he will be equipped in medicine; if he studies physics, he will be equipped in physics
At that time God did not give him any methods rather God led him step by step showing him that what He wanted was his person not his methods
If we have everything, such as education, position, wealth, houses, lands, and so forth, yet do not have God as our life, we are still empty
The God we are experiencing today is the Wonder of wonders and the Miracle of miracles, and yet He is so normal to us
At times the Christian life is sunny, full of the Lord's presence, yet sometimes it is cloudy, even stormy and dark
No matter what trials we went through, we discovered that there is something within us that cannot be annulled
In other words, the Spirit of the Triune God is now within our spirit as our life, enabling us to enjoy God as our all
Lastly, by the Spirit we must put to death the practices of the body , which are the practices of the entire person
We should set our mind on the spirit so that the Spirit of the Triune God who is in our spirit may come into our mind and make our mind life
There is a lot of Christian literature, but it is difficult to find one book that talks about the feeling of the spirit
Though the term the feeling of the spirit is not found in the New Testament, there is such a thing according to its revelation
The feeling that we are speaking of here is the feeling of the mingled spirit that comes from the mingling of the two spirits
In the New Testament, when the Lord Jesus was baptized and came out of the water, the Spirit of God descended upon Him as a dove
After we are saved, however, not only do we feel that to be proud is wrong, but in our deepest being we have the sense of shame
The ingredient of God has been added into our spirit, and this ingredient has produced a feeling, the feeling of the spirit
If you wander all the time in your imagination, your mind will not be sober and your feeling of the spirit will not be keen
Or the thought may come that tonight when you go out to knock on doors, in the first house you visit the whole household will be baptized
These kinds of sudden thoughts can be frequent and can come to you during prayer, while you sleep, or during the day
Some Christians are not clear about these situations and are manipulated by these sudden thoughts, doing things without consideration
Also, Proverbs 10:19 says, 'In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips is wise'
In the church life, if we want to nullify all these negative things, we have to follow the feeling of the spirit
Many philosophers throughout the ages came up with the thought of asceticism through their observation and realization of fallen mankind
They considered that the evil lusts within man could be eliminated only through the exercise of self-suppression
Madame Guyon once said that the cross is something to be loved, and that she desired to embrace and kiss the cross
In John 1224 the Lord Jesus said Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies it abides alone but if it dies it bears much fruit
His ministry caused the terminated ones to have a new beginning, to resurrect from the dead, and to obtain the divine life
Now let us examine a few obvious and important verses concerning this profound principle of living through dying
These practices do not refer only to the sinful things, but also to all the things done by our body outside of the Spirit
Galatians 5:24-25 says, 'But they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts
The experience of this fact can be fulfilled only by our carrying out through the Spirit the crucifixion accomplished by Christ
We do not experience crucifixion, burial, and resurrection alone, but experience them with Christ by being in Him
Due to the fall of man, Satan's elements were added into man's body, and the body was changed in nature to become the flesh
John 12:31 says that when Christ was lifted up on the cross, Satan was judged and the world which hangs upon Satan was also judged
Ephesians 2:15 says that when Christ was crucified, He abolished in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances
John 12:24 shows us even further that Christ was like a grain of wheat which fell into the earth and died to release the divine life
Now all we have to do is to acknowledge, receive, enjoy, and experience by faith these accomplished divine facts
As long as we are in Him receiving and enjoying the fact of dying and living with Him we can experience and know the resurrection of Christ
Our daily life ought to be a life under the cross in which our soul life is continually put to death so that we may live by the life of God
As a conclusion, the New Testament consistently reveals to us that our Christian life is a life of living through dying
Such a living through dying surpasses any philosophy in the world and any concept of asceticism taught by religion
God does not want anything of the old creation; God only wants the new creation transformed from the old creation
According to the revelation of the Bible, all the dead ones, whether saved or not, will be resurrected in the future
Today we all have the Lord's life which went through death and resurrection, and we all have become His many grains
Many Christians have understood this matter of death and resurrection as something which only happened to the Lord Jesus as a man
They did not see that when the Man Jesus died, God did not leave Him; rather He was in Him and was with Him all the time
As long as we have this God, we have also the God of creation, the God of incarnation, and the God of the resurrection from the dead
He did not have to wait until He resurrected from the dead to be resurrection; He was resurrection even before He resurrected from the dead
When Martha and Mary were mourning for their brother Lazarus who had been dead for four days, Jesus came to their village
Martha went to greet Him and complained to Him saying, 'Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died'
When Lazarus was alive, the Lord was resurrection; when Lazarus was dead, the Lord was even the more resurrection
Because He was resurrection, and was so even before He resurrected from the dead, He could not be held by death
Today the God in whom we have believed, whom we have received, and whom we have obtained is even the more the God of resurrection
We will then enjoy the power of the Lord's resurrection and will live out the love and humility of resurrection
The surpassing greatness of His power mentioned here is the power of resurrection mentioned in Philippians 3:10
The power God has toward us is the same as the power which He wrought in Christ in raising Him from among the dead
The fourth portion in Romans 6:9 says, 'Christ having been raised from among the dead dies no more; death lords it over Him no more'
Not only so, the One who raised Christ from among the dead was God, and God Himself is resurrection, and resurrection is the Spirit of God
Today this Spirit dwells within us, giving life to our mortal bodies so that our mortal bodies can be made alive
Christ not only resurrected from among the dead by the Spirit of God, He Himself in resurrection became a life-giving Spirit
For we who live are always being delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our mortal flesh
For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection'
Through baptism, our old man was buried with Christ into death so that we may live and move in the realm of resurrection
During baptism, we grew together with Him in the likeness of His death; and now through His death we grow into His resurrection
After we have experienced the proper baptism, we in Him will continue to grow together with Him in the likeness of Christ's resurrection
The last portion in Romans 8:13b says, 'If by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live'
Today our God is the God of resurrection; moreover, resurrection is God Himself, that is, the Spirit of God and also the life of God
We need to continue the fellowship from the last chapter to see what it is to know the power of Christ's resurrection
In the Old Testament although God had created the heavens the earth mankind and everything He Himself had not yet passed through any process
Just as He was the selfexisting everexisting and unique Jehovah God in eternity past He was still the same after creation without any change
Through this death on the negative side He nullified sin and death destroyed Satan judged the world and also terminated the old creation
In this long process from incarnation to His perfecting of the gifts to give to His church, the peak was His entering into resurrection
From the point of view of the Triune God Himself, He is complete; but from the point of view of the process, He was not yet complete
Not only so, in the New Testament, resurrection is not merely a matter, but also a Person, that is, the Triune God
In the same way that resurrection is this mysterious Triune God, the Spirit is also this mysterious Triune God
If we want to know the power of Christ's resurrection, the important point is that we must first know this processed Triune God
He was incarnated passed through human living accomplished an allinclusive death entered into resurrection and became the lifegiving Spirit
According to the revelation of the Bible four items mentioned in the New TestamentSpirit life resurrection and powerall refer to one Person
The Spirit is a wonderful Person, yet the Spirit is resurrection; therefore, resurrection is also this wonderful Person
Today in resurrection, He is the Spirit, He is resurrection, He is life, and He is also the power for us to receive and enjoy
With His divinity, humanity, human living, and all-inclusive death, He went into resurrection and even became resurrection itself
Believing in the resurrection of Christ is the condition for our salvation; the highest goal of our faith is the resurrection of Christ
The various kinds of situations and circumstances in our daily life are all for us to know the power of Christ's resurrection
In the Spirit there is the resurrection of Christ, and the Spirit is the reality of the resurrection of Christ
He said, 'Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our body
For we who live are always being delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our mortal flesh'
The putting to death of Jesus destroys our natural man and our outward shell, so that the life of God within us can be manifested
When we are under the operation of the Lord's death, His resurrection life will be dispensed into others through us
Only by cultivation and self-refinement can reason be maintained and lusts be removed until one arrives at the realm of 'bright virtue'
The Chinese Confucians made a thorough study concerning human beings but they did not know Gods salvation nor had they received Gods life
He allowed the death of Jesus to do the killing work upon him so that the life of Jesus could be expressed through him
Following that, in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit and entered into all those who believe into Him to be their life
All the work that the Lord is doing on us is to destroy our outward, natural man so that we can live out the life of God within us
Through daily bearing the cross, we always put ourselves to death, like a grain that has fallen into the ground and died
When we passed through baptism and rose up from the death waters, we more or less had a sense of newness of life
Afterwards, through distraction by our own concept of good and evil, we began to care less for the sense of the new life
We began to make up our mind to do good and to endeavor to be a God-pleasing Christian through asceticism and self-denial
In this way the effectiveness of the death of Christ will be applied to us, and the life of God will be lived out from within us
If we are to know and experience this power of Christ, we need to be joined and conformed to the death of Christ
With us, it is first the power of His resurrection and then the fellowship of His sufferings and the conformation to His death
Once a person receives the gospel and believes in the Lord, the first thing that happens to him is baptism into the Triune God
When we remain in the death of Christ and walk in it, we can enjoy the power of Christ's resurrection within us
Romans 6:5 says that if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection
The likeness of His death here is the baptism mentioned in the previous verse, and the likeness of His resurrection is the newness of life
The second portion is Galatians 52425 which says But they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts
The cross of Christ has already crucified and terminated our old man and the self ; this is an accomplished fact
For we who live are always being delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our mortal flesh
When we stay under the termination of the Lord's death, His resurrection life will be dispensed into others through us
There is another portion, Romans 8:13b, which says, 'But if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live'
If we want to serve the Lord, we should follow Him to walk on this pathway of losing the soul life and living in His resurrection
To those who fit our taste, we are drawn closer; those who do not fit our taste, we will dislike and even separate ourselves from them
Honey here signifies natural affection, virtues, or excellencies; salt denotes the death of Christ, or the cross
Tis not hard to die with Christ When His risen life we know; 'Tis not hard to share His suff'rings When our hearts with joy o'erflow
One time he said to me, 'Brother Lee, if you bury a piece of stone in the soil, after one or two years, nothing will happen
If you bury a living seed in the soil, whether it be a flower seed or a barley seed, after a period of time, something will grow out of it'
In this way, we will have the same love toward all the brothers and sisters and will not be close to some and distant from others
Rather we are learning day by day to die to ourselves that the power of resurrection within can have the opportunity to energize and operate
Suffering is very good perfecting for us because in the death of Christ and in dying to ourselves, we experience Christ
Regardless of the kind of circumstances we are in or the kind of situation we encounter the Triune God within us is the allinclusive Spirit
In 1 Corinthians 14, the emphasis is not on foretelling, but on speaking for the Lord and speaking forth the Lord
Rather, his desire was that every one of the saints would prophesy, that is, to speak for the Lord and speak forth the Lord
Corinthians 14 begins by saying, 'Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy
The pursuing of love must be matched with the pursuing of the most profitable gift, that is, the gift of prophesying
In the church life, we should not only love one another, but also pursue gifts for the fulfillment of God's purpose
If there are prophesyings in the meetings, and they are good and successful, then the new way will have a breakthrough
Verse 12 says, 'So also you, since you are zealots of spiritual gifts, seek that you may excel to the building up of the church'
The word 'excel' in the original language implies filling, abounding, overflowing, as well as denoting excelling
According to the context, this word here does not refer to overflowing to abound, but to excelling above the ordinary
According to the apostle, this mixed-up pursuit is very base and can cause the pursuers to be considered by others as Gentiles
We may have a teaching of the teacher to supply people with the riches of Christ for edification and nourishment
In order for us to be able to speak for the Lord, not only do we need to learn the Lord's word, but also know the truths
Everyone who wants to speak for the Lord must have a full knowledge and complete understanding of these things
In the matter of speaking for the Lord, besides learning and knowing the Lord's word, we also need to experience the Lord
We cannot relate to others what we ourselves do not know; neither can we supply others with what we ourselves have not experienced
If you want to speak well, to speak with revelation and with supply, you need to have much practice and learning
In the Old Testament, the first aspect of God's economy is the law, which is the main body of the Old Testament
The apostles were with the Lord Jesus for three and a half years and received the teaching of the New Testament economy
What completed the teaching of the New Testament economy was not the presence of the Lord Jesus, but the presence of the Spirit
All things of the Father are Thine; All Thou art in Spirit is mine; The Spirit makes Thee real to me, That Thou experienced might be
There is only one law in the Old Testament-the law of Moses; there is only one teaching in the New Testament-the teaching of the apostles
Consequently Revelation says that the revelation of Gods New Testament has been completed and none is able to add to nor take away from it
The term 'the teaching of the apostles' appears once in the New Testament as a whole phrase and in many places in fragments
God's Old Testament economy has only one law; God's New Testament economy has also only one teaching of the apostles
Besides the teaching of the apostles, there were the teachings of the Nicolaitans , of Balaam , as well as that of Jezebel
The teaching of the Nicolaitans is just the teaching of clergy and laity, which is outside of the teaching of the apostles
In this message we shall see that only the teaching of the apostles can stand in Gods New Testament economy and it will stand unto eternity
The Old Testament ministry is one of death and condemnation, since the Old Testament brings in condemnation and kills
Today in the Lord's recovery, our way, our service, our work, and our meetings are all based on these four levels
Revelation 1 proves that the church in a locality is also one ; in each of the seven cities there was only one church
The New Testament ministry is building the church of God and the local churches, that is, the Body of Christ today
The work of the New Testament ministry is the building up of the Body of Christ according to the teaching of the apostles
The Church is Christ's own Body, The Father's dwelling-place, The gathering of the called ones, God blended with man's race
As far as the church being the Lord's Body is concerned, there is the difference between large and small members
Today in the local church, we may not be too clear ourselves about what position we should take or what function we should have
In the Body we become very clear: the hand knows where the foot is, and the nose also knows where the mouth is
While our eyes may see clearly what others' functions should be, we ourselves are often not too clear about ourselves
You may not be clear about your rank among them, but you know who is the oldest, who is the second oldest and who is the youngest brother
As young people serving the Lord from your youth, you must learn the lesson never to have any ambition to be a leader in God's house
The ears are not for themselves when they grow on the sides of the head neither are the eyes for themselves when they are in the eye sockets
You should do your best to function as a member in the position that is organically arranged for you in the Lord's Body
Although they had a great difference in age and Paul indeed could be a teacher to Timothy, Paul still deemed Timothy a brother
In addition, we must learn in the service not to desire leadership, to have opinions, to envy, to credit ourselves, or to have our own work
It gives them the opportunity to devote their lives to pursue God, to dive deeply into the truth, and to grow in life
It was very difficult in the past to determine whether or not a certain one should be full-time; eventually, we could not find a proper way
The evangelization of Taiwan needs not only a thousand or more full-timers, but also thousands and tens of thousands of saints
After you are back in your own locality, if the church formally initiates preaching the gospel, you will be able to cooperate with it
Brothers and sisters who have been trained and who hope to serve full-time their entire life still need to have further testing
You should still look to the Lord, because one day He may change the environment and you will be free to be full-time again
From this point of view, there is no life-long preacher system, nor does anyone take preaching as a life-time profession
He says in Acts 20:34, 'You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my needs and to those who are with me'
His making tents with his own two hands provided not only for his own needs, but also for the needs of his companions
When you joined the training, many of you had intended to return to a job after being full-time for one or two years
It is good that you know how to use The Mystery of Human Life to preach the gospel, but that alone is not enough
In the group meeting, you must learn how to lead people to share mutually, care mutually, and learn to speak the Lord's word
As soon as the army advances, victory will be everywhere and the evangelization of Taiwan will be a great success
On the one hand, the revelation of the Bible tells us that the white horse, representing the gospel, will overcome again and again
The evangelization of Taiwan will undoubtedly be accomplished, but it will be through much struggling and striving
We must see that in the whole process of the evangelization of Taiwan there are fightings and strivings all the way
In Acts 15 we see that Paul and Barnabas were originally intimate co-workers, often fighting along side one another
In the end, even all who were in Asia turned away from Paul, forsaking his ministry and teaching which they received from him
Even though Paul met so many difficulties, persecutions and forsakings, he was all the more strengthened in the grace of Christ
On the one hand, we do see success with Him, but it was not always 'sunshine without clouds or storms,' as most people think
Once He and the disciples got on a boat, and He said to His disciples, 'Let us go over to the other side of the lake; and they launched out'
The fallen angels in the air and evil spirits in the water worked together to prevent the Lord from going across
There was hardly a place where there was no storm, and there was hardly a step taken without encountering resistance
The Pharisees were always following Jesus closely, seeking to ensnare Him in His talk and even to conspire against Him
When He was on the cross, people still jeered at Him, saying, 'If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross'!
After the Lord resurrected and ascended, the apostles continued His ministry and propagated God's work on earth
When Paul came, not only did he suffer much outward affliction and persecution, but he encountered troubles among his co-workers as well
Paul advised him to go to Corinth to help when Paul was bearing the burden of the problem in Corinth, yet he absolutely would not go
We know that in the work of serving the Lord, it is not hard to be like-spirited, but to be like-souled is really difficult
The more you follow the Lord, and the more you are used by the Lord, the more the opposition and attacks will come
In the ten years between 1956 and 1966, there was a big storm among us, bringing in no small difficulty and frustration
