 <h2 class="head2">G. Satan&rsquo;s Defeat by the Believers<br />
and the Church</h2>
<p>Although Satan has done some damage to the believers and the church, the believers and the church have victories over Satan as well.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Lord Delivering the Believers<br />
out of the Authority of Satan</h2>
<p>See Colossians 1:13 and Acts 26:18.</p>

Who Were Begotten of God, to Overcome Satan and Keeping Them Out of Satan&rsquo;s Touch</h2>
<p>See 1 John 2:13-14 and 5:18.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Lord Keeping the Believers<br />
out of the Hands of Satan, the Evil One</h2>
<p>See Matthew 6:13, John 17:15, and 2 Thessalonians 3:3.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Lord Giving Believers Authority<br />
to Tread upon Satan and over All His Power</h2>
<p>See Luke 10:19 and Romans 16:20.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. The Believers Overcoming Satan<br />
Because of the Lord&rsquo;s Blood,<br />
the Word of Their Testimony,<br />
and Their Being Faithful unto Death</h2>
<p>See Revelation 12:11.</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. The Believers Being Able to<br />
Cast Out Demons in the Lord&rsquo;s Name</h2>
<p>See Mark 16:17.</p>
<h2 class="head3">7. The Believers Not Giving<br />
Any Place to the Devil</h2>
<p>See Ephesians 4:27.</p>
<h2 class="head3">8. The Believers Being Aware<br />
of Satan&rsquo;s Schemes</h2>
<p>See 2 Corinthians 2:11.</p>
<h2 class="head3">9. The Believers Being Sober and Watching,<br />
Withstanding Satan in Their Faith</h2>
<p>See 1 Peter 5:8-9 and James 4:7.</p>

Standing against Satan,<br />
and Wrestling against Him</h2>
<p>See Ephesians 6:11-20.</p>
