   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ Himself</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The daily life of a Christian is one of enjoying Christ and receiving Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the one hand, we stand in Christ, realizing that all that Christ has accomplished is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the other hand, while we live on this earth day by day Christ becomes everything that we need.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ is the very things themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our sanctification is just Christ, our righteousness is just Christ, our patience is just Christ, and our humility, meekness, and goodness are just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Joy is not when we are happy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Joy is Christ living within us and being expressed as joy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Meekness is not a feigned appearance of weakness before others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is Christ living within us and being expressed as meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our joy, our meekness, etc., are all Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These are the expressions of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is what makes Christianity so special.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have a life within us, and this life is just Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is no need for us to use our own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This life will spontaneously express itself in meekness, goodness, humility, and patience.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ in us becomes our meekness, our goodness, our humility, and our patience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We may think that meekness, goodness, humility, and patience are virtues that we possess, but God's Word shows us that these things are just Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God has put His Son within us so that Christ Himself will live spontaneously out of us in all circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we are tempted by anxiety, this life will manifest itself as patience.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we are tempted by pride, this life will manifest itself as humility.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we are tempted by stubbornness, this life will manifest itself as meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we are tempted by defilement, this life will manifest itself as holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ will express His patience, His humility, His meekness, and His holiness from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ becomes our patience, our humility, and our holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is not a matter of our doing, but a matter of Christ living.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We do not need to try to be humble by the power of the Lord; rather, Christ is our humility.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We do not need to try to be holy by the power of the Lord; rather, Christ is our holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We do not need to fulfill God's goal by living by ourselves or even by the power of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The spontaneous manifestation of Christ Himself fulfills God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the Lord is expressed through us, we become what we are spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE GOD OF ISAAC AND THE GOD OF JACOB</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have to know the God of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we want to go on, we have to commit ourselves to the Almighty God and allow Him to reveal Himself to us as the Father at the proper time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to see that nothing from ourselves will satisfy His heart and that everything must be of Him, because only God is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must also know the God of Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have to see that everything is accomplished by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the past, He accomplished everything.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the future, He will still accomplish everything.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His facts are ours, His life is ours, and His experiences and power are ours.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is one thing for us to be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is another thing for Christ to be in us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Neither aspect requires any effort on our part.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One day the Lord will open our eyes to see that everything is of Christ and from God and that everything has been accomplished by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God is the source and Christ is the One who is working.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After we know the God of Isaac, we still must know the God of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What is the difference in spiritual significance between the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We can say that the God of Isaac shows us how God has dispensed His Son to us, while the God of Jacob shows us how God is disciplining us through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The God of Isaac shows us God's gift, while the God of Jacob shows us God's workmanship.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The God of Isaac gives us the boldness to testify, "God has given me new light and shown me that Christ is my life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I have overcome!"</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The God of Jacob causes us to confess humbly, "God has shown me the self, and I can never trust in it again or boast of its usefulness."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The God of Isaac causes us to proclaim boldly, "Sin is trampled under my feet!"</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The God of Jacob causes us to fearfully confess, "I can still fail at any time."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The God of Isaac shows us Christ, while the God of Jacob shows us ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The knowledge of the God of Isaac gives us the confidence to know that everything is done by Christ and not by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The knowledge of the God of Jacob causes us to know ourselves and delivers us from presumptuousness.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we study God's Word carefully, we will see these two different kinds of experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We can say that the God of Jacob completes the work of the God of Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The God of Jacob works in us to make room for the God of Isaac so that Christ will gain a place and occupy more and more ground in us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is this very work that puts us "in weakness and in fear and in much trembling" 1 Cor 2:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Our life is a paradox.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We have much assurance in Christ, and at the same time, we have no assurance in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>On the one hand, we are bold to testify and speak, but on the other hand, we are fearful of speaking anything and feel like dust before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Without the blood of the Lord, we cannot face God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>After we know the God of Isaac, we still have to go on to know the God of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When we combine these two experiences together, we have the proper Christian life.</S>
