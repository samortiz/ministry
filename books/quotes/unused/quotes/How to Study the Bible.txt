We must let the word of God dwell richly in our hearts before we can hear His speaking today and before He can make us ministers of His word
During the past few centuries, in particular since the rise of Protestantism, many books have been published on the study of the Bible
Even when some have the right methods, they can never study the Bible well because they are wrong in their very person
It is wrong to think that very few people can study the Bible, and it is equally wrong to think that everyone can study the Bible
Only one kind of person can study the Bible, and we have to be that kind of person before we can study the Bible well
We also should recall the Lord's word in John 4:24: 'God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit'
God is Spirit, and we can only worship Him with our spirit; we cannot worship Him with anything other than the spirit
For this reason, everyone who reads this book must approach it with his spirit; it must be read with the spirit
Only those who have this spirit can read the Bible well; those who do not have this spirit cannot read it well
From that day forward, the Bible will become a new book to him; he will begin to understand and treasure this book
The life which a man receives at the time of regeneration is spirit, and it takes a man with a spirit to read the words of spirit
No matter how clever and well educated a man is, as long as he is not regenerated, this book is a mystery to him
A regenerated person may not be that cultivated, but he is more qualified to read the Bible than an unregenerated college professor
No matter how educated, logical, and analytical a man is, he cannot understand the Bible if he does not have this spirit
In order to study the Bible, a man must have a regenerated spirit, in the same way that he must have a regenerated spirit to touch God
He wants to connect the lamp to the power source but the only materials he has are wood bamboo and cloth he does not have any copper wire
If a man has a regenerated spirit, and such a spirit is functional within him, he will touch the spirit when he touches God's word
They are spirit only to the believers who have believed into Him; to the unbelieving Jews His words were received as a matter of flesh
Read also verses 5 to 7: 'In order that your faith would not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God
A somewhat more scientific description of the soulish man is the psychological man, the man under the control of his own psychology
He is like Adam, a living soul, who does not have the Spirit of God within him and who cannot know the things of God
Suppose you take a man who is born blind into a garden and tell him that he is standing in front of a mango tree
Even if he is very clever, very discerning, and has very sharp ears, he will still not understand what a mango tree is like
The world of sound is different from the world of sight, and the world of sight is different from the world of thoughts
The problem today is that blind ones have no eyes to see the mango tree, while men with good eyes try to hear the mango tree with their ears
Knowledge does not help an unbeliever understand the Bible; neither does it help a Christian understand the Bible
No one can say that he has a spirit but does not have to walk according to it and instead can walk according to his former ways
Corinthians 3:1 says, 'And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to fleshy, as to infants in Christ'
A man does not continue drinking milk all the time; there is only a short period during his life when he has to drink milk
A soulish man is an unregenerated man; he does not have a regenerated spirit and does not have the proper organ to understand God's word
He has a spirit, but he does not come under the control of the spirit or allow the spirit to take over everything
In order to study the Bible, we have to remember these basic requirements: We must be spiritual and we must walk according to the spirit
Corinthians 3:18 says, 'But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord'
A man who is closed to God may study and pray much, but he will remain ignorant as far as understanding the Bible is concerned
Any lack of sight that we experience, whether great or small, complete or partial, means that we are in darkness
If a man's consecration to God is perfect and absolute, he will have no reservation toward God and will not be closed in any way
All kinds of darkness come as a result of being closed, and being closed in any area is the result of a lack of consecration and submission
If therefore your eye is single, your whole body will be full of light; but if your eye is evil, your whole body will be dark'
The Lord said No one can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or he will hold to one and despise the other
Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will hold to one and despise the other; he cannot serve both well
If they could lay aside their personal interest and pursue the truth at all costs, the Bible would be crystal clear to them
If all the Christians were settled in the matter of mammon, there would be a big increase in the number of obedient ones
As soon as he opens the Bible, he will come across places that he has held back in consecration, and darkness will be with him
Some people have argued that they are sincere in seeking God's will, yet they do not know what the Bible teaches
A consecrated person must not only have an initial, fundamental consecration, but he must sustain an obedience before the Lord all the time
The amount of light a man receives depends on the amount of obedience he sustains after his initial consecration
If we supplement this with our obedience, our attitude will be right once again and God will grant us further revelation
If we respond to the revelation with obedience, we will have more of the right attitude and will receive more revelation
God is never short of light, but whenever He sees any unwillingness on our part, He will hold back His speaking
If there is any unwillingness on our part, the Holy Spirit will shy away; He will retreat and not release Himself in a cheap way
It is not a small thing for a man to fail to understand the Bible, because it underscores a problem in his consecration
Many people do not understand what others are saying, not because they are unintelligent, but because they are too subjective
In order to find out if we are subjective, we only need to ask ourselves if we understand what others are saying
An objective man can get more from reading the Bible one time than a subjective man can from reading it ten times
Sin in the singular form refers to man's sinful nature, whereas the plural form of the word, sins, refers to man's sinful acts
When the Bible speaks of God's forgiveness of man's sins, it uses the plural form-sins, as the many sinful acts
If we are careless, we may not think that there is much difference between sin and the law of sin, and may thus overlook God's word
If our speaking is careless we will be led to think that Gods word is also careless and this will frustrate us from understanding His word
Sin leads one to involuntarily do what he does not want to do, whereas death prohibits one from doing what he wants to do
A careless person will think that the righteousness of the Lord Jesus and the Lord Jesus as righteousness are more or less the same
Little does he realize that the righteousness of the Lord Jesus belongs to Him alone; it can never be transferred to us
His body was hung on the cross, and His soul, through the blood, was poured out for the accomplishment of redemption
When we realize that the Lord Jesus has redeemed us from sin, spontaneously our conscience will no longer be conscious of sin
Some people have spent a great deal of time trying to ascertain whether or not the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is a vine tree
They study prophecies not for the sake of waiting for the Lord's return, but because they want to know about the future
If we are a curious person, all spiritual and valuable things will become non-spiritual and dead when they fall into our hands
Before the Lord, we have to distinguish between things which are valuable and things which are not so valuable
In order to understand the words of the Holy Spirit, we must direct our thoughts to the thoughts of the Holy Spirit
We cannot consider them as methods of studying the Bible, for they relate to the very person who reads the Bible
We must remember that the value of the words lies not in the words themselves but in the meaning which they convey
The two have to flow like two currents in a river, the Holy Spirit being the main current, while we are the subsidiary current
As we touch the thoughts of the Holy Spirit, we have to be very objective; our whole being should follow the thoughts carried forth by Him
They can barely catch up with the Holy Spirit for ten minutes, after which their own thoughts begin to wander off
He has to find out what the Spirit is saying in a passage, what He is thinking, and what His main thoughts and subsidiary thoughts are
The first question we should ask when we read a portion of the Scripture is what is the Spirit's intention in writing this portion
It is not enough for us to merely read the letters or remember the words, memorize the words, or study their meaning in an isolated way
Putting it in another way, we should sense the thoughts of Paul, Peter, John, and the others when the Holy Spirit spoke through them
A story was told of a believer who took a journey through the forty-two stations that the Israelites passed through from Egypt to Palestine
The Spirit can digress from His subject with a word of explanation for five or ten verses, but He always comes back to the 'trunk'
We must not dwell on the explanations all the time; we must follow the Holy Spirit and turn back to the subject
We have to be very tender and very careful to not put any trust in ourselves or have any assurance in our flesh
It is all right for us to borrow a verse, but we have to differentiate clearly between borrowing a verse and making an exegesis of the verse
It is not a bad idea to go through the New Testament and put parentheses around passages that the Spirit provides as words of explanation
If we skip the verses in the parentheses and read the rest, we will get an idea of the main subjects of the various portions
Verse 5 says, 'Through whom we have received grace and apostleship unto the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles on behalf of His name'
The four Gospels cover the part of Him according to the flesh, while the Epistles cover the part of Him according to the Spirit
It enables us to know how much of the teaching in a portion relates to the subject and how much relates to explanations
Although our functioning as ministers of the word is not as perfect and profound as that of the first apostles, it is the same in principle
Explanation is for the purpose of helping others to understand, but we should not be excessive in our use of it
At the beginning we should only work with the text portions; we should not work on the explanatory words within the parentheses
Once we have an impression of these facts from the Holy Spirit, it will be easy for Him to convey God's word to us
If these facts do not produce an impression in us, God's word will not take hold in us and will not produce the proper effect in us
In reading a contract, it is not enough to check whether or not there is a signature on it; we must check whose signature is on it
The impression that we are speaking of here is not a general impression but an impression of its special character
It is possible that a person can remember and even relate a biblical incident to others but not be able to point out its special character
For the four Gospels and Acts, however, our heart has to be open to God's Spirit, and we have to allow Him to impress us with the facts
We will know what God wants to say behind the facts, and we will be able to tell the difference between these facts and other facts
A man must be tender, and his feelings must be very sensitive before God's word can stamp a clear image within him
He will not only catch a glimpse of the general contour, but he will have an accurate impression of the fine points and lines
In the fishing expedition after the Lord's resurrection, Peter jumped into the sea and swam ashore when he recognized the Lord
In the second case, the revelation drew this man who already knew the Lord to a more intimate relationship with Him
Two incidents are recorded in all four Gospels: the Lord's feeding of the five thousand with bread, and the anointing of the Lord by Mary
After the Lord fed the five thousand, He ordered the disciples to gather the broken pieces that nothing would be lost
The Lord performed a miracle to feed men with bread, yet He asked the disciples to gather the broken pieces lest they be wasted
Nothing produced from a miracle was to be wasted, yet something worth over three hundred denarii could be poured on the Lord and not spared
The ointment was worth three hundred denarii; it was not spent to feed five thousand but to be consumed by the Lord in an instant
All four Gospels record this story, and everywhere that men preach the gospel, they are to remember this story
When we compare the two, we find that one is God's only begotten Son, while the other is merely a child of God
After He finished, He spoke a little, but the crowd took Him to the brow of a hill so that they might throw Him down the cliff
The Lord Jesus rebuked the wind and the waves, and they were stilled; then He turned and rebuked the disciples for their little faith
With the Lord having said that they would go over to the other side, it was not possible for them to end up at the bottom of the sea
Under normal circumstances, the more lessons a man learns before the Lord, the more he has to apologize to others
Outwardly speaking, the Lord appeared to be wrong; it seemed as if the disciples were justified in their indignation
In reading the Bible we have to learn to apply the principle of gathering together all the portions which speak of similar things
When the Lord indicated to the disciples that He had to go to Jerusalem, Peter said, 'God be merciful to You, Lord'!
A woman stood at the Lord's feet weeping, wetting His feet with her tears, and wiping them with the hair of her head
Simon thought in his heart, 'This man, if He were a prophet, would know who and what sort of woman this is who is touching Him'
Although Simon did not open his mouth, the Lord knew what he was thinking, and He spoke about different kinds of forgiving
In effect the Lord was saying, 'You, Simon, did not wash My feet, because you have experienced little forgiveness
Unless a man was ready to sacrifice himself and give his all, he would jump back at the sight of a leper and say, 'You are hurting me!
Being unable to bring him to the Lord because of the crowd, they removed the roof where He was, and lowered the paralytic to the Lord
He did not rebuke the leper who came to Him, and He did not rebuke the paralytic whose friends removed the roof
In effect the Lord was saying, 'If you, the lawyer, can love your neighbor as you love yourself, you will have eternal life'
They do not realize that they cannot go to the cross to forgive sins, and they cannot be lifted up to bring down the Holy Spirit
When men sought to catch the Lord in the garden of Gethsemane, He stepped forward and said to them, 'Whom do you seek?
Our Lord prayed at the garden of Gethsemane but He did not plead for anything at the court before the high priest or before the magistrate
When He appeared before the magistrate, it was the latter who became nervous; he was the one who was aimless in his questions
In the garden of Gethsemane, He told the disciples to be watchful with Him , but He did not ask them to supplicate for Him
He asked the disciples to pray because He did not want them to enter into temptation ; He was asking them to pray for themselves
After He drove out the company of demons, He charged the previously possessed man to go home and to speak what God had done for him
They told Him, 'Depart from here and go into Judea for no one does anything in secret and himself seeks to be known openly
In order to understand the history both in the Old and the New Testament, we have to have the right impressions
If a person has a low discernment, he cannot be expected to appreciate the dignity of the Lord Jesus when he reads the Gospels
If he does not know the meaning of dignity and glory, how can he be expected to form an impression of the Lord's dignity and glory?
We will have deeper and deeper impressions every day, and we will understand more and more of His Word every day
God's Spirit prompted men to write the Scriptures, and whether it is history or doctrines, each portion has a spirit of its own
When the Holy Spirit enters man's spirit, the condition of the Holy Spirit becomes the condition of man's spirit
In the same principle, in the writing of the Epistles, the Holy Spirit did not just convey doctrines and thoughts
In reading the Bible, we have to touch the spirit, that is, the particular spirit behind a portion of the Word
We must point out that this can be realized only through the discipline of the Holy Spirit, not by man's effort
God's Spirit arranges everything in the environment and operates until our spirit matches the spirit of the Scriptures
We reach the highest peak in the study of the Scriptures when our spirit harmonizes with the spirit of the writers of the Bible
Their spirits were perfected, and through their spirits the Holy Spirit operated to write the words that became the Bible
When we read the Bible, our spirit must also be led by the Holy Spirit to match the spirit of those who were prompted to write the Bible
Except some psalms which use the word selah there is no other indication in the whole Bible as to whether we should read it loudly or softly
If we cannot distinguish between the 'loud' portions and the 'soft' portions, how can we distinguish the condition of the spirit?
The preacher pleads because he is aware of the sufferings of the sinners and sees the danger of their ways before the Lord
He will not know the meaning of rebuking under the pressure of the spirit; he will only know to rebuke when he is angry
He will not realize that the spirit within the words may be different even though the words of rebuke are the same
We should realize that the best and most important training in our life comes from the discipline of the Holy Spirit
It is so deep that the only thing we can say is that we are clear, that everything has become transparent to us
We need a certain amount of time, at least a few years, for the Lord to adjust our spirit, to temper it, and to break it
Once the spirit is broken, it will be easy for the Holy Spirit to bring us into harmony with the condition of the Scriptures
No matter how productive our imagination is or how powerful our perception is, we cannot get into the spirit of the Word
As we begin to understand the Bible, we begin the process of feeding, and as we are fed, our capacity increases
The discipline of the Holy Spirit first brings a man's spirit into harmony with the spirit of the Bible as far as the quality is concerned
At the same time, through the words of the Scripture, He brings us the supply so that our capacity will increase
In reality, however, the Spirit that was present at the time of the writing of the Scriptures is still with us today
If we touch the Bible according to the letters or according to our thoughts, it will become old to us before very long
Whenever we find a portion of the Word tasteless, it is not the portion itself that is tasteless but our spirit that has failed to function
Because we have only experienced limited dealing, we remain at the place where we were before, being ignorant of many things
The scope of our knowledge of the Bible depends on the amount of discipline we have received from the Holy Spirit
Let us consider two examples in the Bible and from them find the meaning of entering into the spirit of the Word
He thought that Joseph was devoured by the beasts, and said, 'I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning'
He split up his children into groups, thinking that he would preserve the second if the first suffered calamities
If the old Jacob had been there, he probably would have acted the same as he did when he met Laban, setting his eyes on Laban's possessions
And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was a hundred forty and seven years
Was a man who by nature was cunning and hard, who would do everything to satisfy himself and would ask for nothing less than the best
God had promised that he would be fruitful and multiply and that the land of Canaan would be given to his seed
Verses 12 through 14 say, 'And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth
Verses 17 through 19 say, 'And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him
Among Paul's Epistles, 2 Corinthians stands out as the book that reveals more of his spirit than any other book
Other Epistles tell us the revelations that Paul received, but this Epistle reveals to us the very person Paul was
If we read through 2 Corinthians sentence by sentence, we will understand not only Paul's thoughts but also his spirit
If our spirit cannot match Paul's spirit in 2 Corinthians, we may take his boasting to the Corinthians as a kind of complaint
Either we should give up reading the Bible altogether, or we have to bring our spirit up to the level of the spirit of the Bible
We will consider the keys to studying the Bible; second, we will consider the practice; and third, we will consider the plan
In other words, if we want to find out anything from the Bible, we have to search for it in the Scriptures themselves
We should ask these questions one by one slowly, look for the answers carefully, and not stop until we have found what we are looking for
Sometimes in answering a question, we have to search through the entire Old and New Testaments for things related to the subject
We have to examine the entire Bible carefully word by word, lest we miss something important through oversight
There is no need to force ourselves to mentally apprehend or understand it, and there is no need to insist on receiving light from it
On the one hand, we do not despise prophecy; we need the edification of the prophets as well as those of other ministries
Paul told the Ephesians, 'Remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He Himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive'
All we need to do is spend five to ten minutes a day to study a verse thoroughly and to search and memorize it
A book like Philippians can be finished within four months, and a book like Hebrews can be finished within ten months
Even those with a poor memory can memorize one verse a day during the first four years of their Christian life
If they would do this, they would build up a solid foundation for themselves in their understanding of the New Testament
While we seize every available opportunity to memorize the Scriptures, the word of Christ will dwell in us richly
Memorizing the Scriptures is not for memorization alone; it is to lay the groundwork for us to receive revelation
Besides the above-mentioned crucial passages, other critical portions should also be put together and memorized as a whole
It is not a bad idea to memorize the two prayers of Paul in Ephesians and the ten references to the Holy Spirit in the same book
In tackling a teaching found in the Bible, we have to look for explanations of this teaching from other passages of the Bible
Many heresies in Christianity have resulted from men holding on to one or two verses of the Bible without consulting other related passages
If there is only one verse that says something, we have to be careful; we cannot build something big upon one isolated instance
We can also compare Revelation 2 and 3 with Matthew 13, Revelation 4 and 5 with Philippians 2, and Revelation 6 with Matthew 24
After we have decided to spend, for example, one hour a day on our reading, we should have a plan for that hour
The hour should be divided into several periods, and we should use a different method of study for each period
It is easy to get tired if we do the same thing for an hour, and it is easy to give up when we do not see results immediately
Subjects like prophecies, types, and the death of the Lord Jesus require years of study before we can reap results
These studies do not reap benefit immediately; we have to read them dozens of times before we can get something out of them
We should take note of one thing: After studying for twenty minutes, we may be tempted to extend our reading to thirty minutes
If we can resist extending our time, we will also overcome the temptation of reducing our time from twenty to ten minutes
We should go over all the verses that speak of the blood, note the important ones, and group the ones with similar meanings together
Why does Revelation 1:15 say that the Lord's feet were 'like shining bronze, as having been fired in a furnace'?
Later, we may devote the first period of time to meditate on them and study them, or we may read about them in the second period
Ephesians 1:13 speaks of the seal of the Spirit, and we can write down all the verses in the New Testament that speak of the seal
Ephesians 1:17 speaks of a spirit of wisdom and revelation, and we can write down all the verses that link the spirit with wisdom
After we have collected and sorted out all these facts, we can study them during the twenty minutes of the first or second period
If we do not have the facts gathered and sorted ahead of time, our study will not have a basis and will not be that accurate
We have to touch the thought of the Holy Spirit with our spirit, and we have to open up ourselves to receive the proper impressions
We have to use basically the same expressions, only with a little more explanation of our own to clarify their meaning
We should group a few verses together that naturally form a section, read through the whole section, and then paraphrase it verse by verse
Of course, we should not write too much in our paraphrasing, or else we will find ourselves involved in extensive exegesis
Translation is a mere rendering of the meaning of the original text, while paraphrasing adds a little of our own explanation to it
Paul used the word servant with the idea that he was the Lord's bondservant, a slave who had no freedom of his own
To Him it was an experience, but to us there is no need of an independent crucifixion; we are crucified in Him already
Whatever we write, we have to do it in such a way that those who do not understand the verse will understand it
If we consider for a moment Paul's expression infants in Christ, we will realize that Paul was saying, 'You have been wasting too much time
Mark 13:9 says, 'For My sake,' verse 13 says, 'On account of My name,' and verse 20 says, 'On account of the chosen'
The first 'I said' is a confession, the second 'I said' is a consecration, while the third 'I said' is a fellowship
The print should not be too small, because if it is too small, it will be easy to miss the meanings in the words
The vernacular Chinese language does not express itself as well as the classical Chinese language when it comes to terminology
In some cases the vernacular Chinese is more restricted than the classical Chinese, and in some other cases, the opposite is true
There are many characters in the Old Testament, such as Adam, Abel, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Joshua, David, and Solomon
Upon careful reading, we find that the books of Romans and 1 Corinthians also speak about Adam, and what they say is quite crucial
If we spend three or four months to study him in detail, we will understand many fundamental issues in the Bible
We have to go through all the passages in the Bible that speak of Abel in order to find the basic message that God has for us through him
If a child commits a great offense and yet approaches his parents as if nothing has happened, he cannot possibly be approved
We can continue with the woman with manchild in Revelation 12 the great harlot in chapter seventeen and the Lambs wife in chapter nineteen
If we have seen the reality of Christ, redemption, the church, and the Holy Spirit, it is much easier for us to see the Old Testament types
God shows us that the relationship between Christ and the church is apart from sin, for their relationship began in Genesis 2 not Genesis 3
If we compare the Old Testament and the New Testament, we can find many things in the New Testament that match the Old Testament types
In reading the names of the stations we get a picture of man's sojourning as well the condition for his entry into Canaan
In order to understand the significance of the Israelites entering Canaan and the warfare in Canaan, we must first know what Canaan typifies
Not everyone who passed under the blood of the lamb or ate of the Passover lamb entered Canaan; only two entered
The many lawless acts in the book of Judges typify man's self-willed life which results in all kinds of confusion
The temple was in Jerusalem, typifying the church meeting and worshipping in the Lord's name, because God placed His name in Jerusalem
We can classify the prophecies in the Bible into two categories those concerning Christs first coming and those concerning His second coming
Prophecies concerning His first coming can be found in the Pentateuch, the Psalms, and the books of the prophets
The prophecies concerning His second coming will be fulfilled the same way as the prophecies concerning His first coming
In type, Adam does not refer to Adam literally, but to Christ, and Eve does not refer to Eve literally, but to the church
Prophecies concerning the church can be found in such chapters as Matthew 13 Revelation 23 12 1415 1 Corinthians 15 and 1 Thessalonians 4
If we are not clear about the different dispensations, we will think that some statements in the Bible are confusing
The third dispensation is the dispensation of grace, which spans the time from the first coming of Christ to His second coming
The fourth dispensation is the kingdom, which spans the time from the second coming of Christ to the end of the kingdom age
In every dispensation we have to pay attention to mans original position his responsibilities his failures and Gods way of dealing with him
After we study these points carefully, it will be easy for us to solve all of the seemingly contradictory problems
The principle of incarnation is the principle of Love becoming flesh, Holiness becoming flesh, Joy, Obedience, etc
On the one hand, it means redemption; and on the other hand, it means the termination of everything of the old creation
We have God in man, which points to all of God's operations within man, involving the deeper truths in the Epistles
We even find a record of the number of years a certain person slept on his right and the number of years he slept on his left
We have to know the chronology, and then we will see that the grace of promise was in existence 430 years before the coming of the law
The first lasted eight years , the second eighteen years , the third twenty years , the fourth seven years , and the last forty years
The ear is one of the five organs, the thumb is one of the five fingers, and the big toe is one of the five toes
The New Jerusalem has twelve gates, twelve foundations, the names of the twelve apostles, twelve kinds of precious stones, and twelve pearls
After studying a few of them carefully, we will realize that there are certain principles to interpreting parables
Matthew 13 is the first instance where the Lord spoke to us in parables and in the first parable the Lord gave us the interpretation Himself
If we are caught up with the details, we will lose sight of the spiritual significance of the passage, and our course will be wrong
If we consider the miracles as a special subject and study them, we will find out that each miracle has its own characteristics
In studying these miracles, we must first find out the special characteristics in each case and then find out how the Lord deals with them
Again, in the case of the resurrection of Lazarus, the Lord clearly said that He is the resurrection and the life
If we further compare all the entries in the columns, we will find the similarities and differences between these records
The four living creatures are the lion-the king of the beasts, the ox-the diligent servant, the face of a man, and the eagle
Matthew portrays the Lord Jesus as the King, Mark portrays Him as the Servant, Luke portrays Him as a man, and John portrays Him as God
God was mindful of this man, who was a little lower than the angels, in order that He would be crowned with glory and honor
John does not say anything about the Lord's ascension because it speaks of Him being our life and living within us
We can study each section carefully and consider what the other three Gospels have to say about the things recorded in each section
The dissimilar passages should have broader subdivisions, while the similar passages should have finer subdivisions
Psalm 22 and Isaiah 53 are both very crucial chapters, because much is said in the New Testament about their fulfillment
In the Bible there are thirty to forty such crucial chapters, and we have to understand the meaning of each one of them
The earthly work of Christ, the coming of the Holy Spirit, and the beginning of the church belong to the first group
We have to differentiate between the things that God has done, the things that He is doing, and the things that He will do
Salvation is related to the life which we receive, sanctification relates to our living, and ministry relates to our work
The life given by the Holy Spirit is salvation, the work of the Holy Spirit is sanctification, and the power of the Holy Spirit is ministry
Everything done for us is salvation, everything done in us is sanctification, and everything done through us is ministry
Romans 6 speaks of crucifixion, Romans 8 speaks of the putting to death, while 2 Corinthians 4 speaks of the 'killing'
We have to be absolutely clear before the Lord that crucifixion belongs to the category of salvation; it is something that the Lord has done
The foundation of the New Jerusalem is built with all kinds of precious stones, one of which in green in color
There are the cities of Samaria, the city of Jerusalem, Caesarea, Sodom, Gomorrah, Babel, Ur, Shechem, Bethel, Mahanaim, Gilgal, etc
Some derive their significance from the meaning of the word, while others derive it from the history associated with it
Either they are derived from the meaning of the words themselves, or they are derived from the history associated with them
Examples include 1 Timothy 115 31516 Titus 348 Romans 10810 2 Timothy 21113 Ephesians 489 516 and 1 Thessalonians 41417
For the Holy Spirit to write these eight portions in the form of a song means that there must be precious significance to them
When just one or two words come out of our mouth, they seem to release all that we want to say, and the prayer is answered
Whenever we encounter a difficult passage, we have to study it in conjunction with other passages before we can arrive at any conclusion
We have to look for evidence to solve the difficulties, that is, scriptural evidence as well as logical evidence
If there are contradictions in the numbers used in the Scriptures, we should not consider them as difficulties
At the time it was made, the church was under persecution, Bibles were destroyed everywhere, and it was not easy to make copies
Paul's journey to Jerusalem in Acts 21 is also not a problem in interpretation; it is a problem related to his own action
Following the above principles, let us deal with one specific passage in the Old Testament that poses difficulty
It is commonly acknowledged that Genesis was written at the time of Moses, while Job was written at the time of Abraham
The Lord Jesus said, 'For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven'
In Genesis 3 the greatest confusion in the world occurred: the spirit of Satan entered into a lower animal-a snake
The English translation of Genesis 63 is very clear And the Lord said My Spirit shall not always strive with man for that he also is flesh
To become flesh refers to the whole being falling under the influence of flesh; it has to do with one's very nature
We must not only take note of man's fall in chapter three, but we must realize that there was a progression to man's sinfulness
By the time of the flood, sin had developed further; man had become flesh, and sinning had become a matter of habit
In the days of the Son of Man, there also will be great judgment, and the Lord will judge the angels who leave their own place
Are the angels who leave their own place among the one third who fall in Revelation 12:4, or are they different ones?
The first part of Jude 6 says, 'And angels who did not keep their own principality but abandoned their own dwelling place'
The last part of verse 6 says that these angels are 'kept in eternal bonds under gloom for the judgment of the great day'
In other words, the Lord has given the Holy Spirit to His church so that the church, as His representative and vessel, can forgive others
He weeps, cries, repents, and sincerely accepts the Lord Jesus, but he can still be ignorant of the matter of forgiveness
If someone in the church stands up and declares to him, 'God has forgiven your sins,' this declaration is most helpful to him
The church can decide who is qualified to be baptized and who is eligible for the Lord's table because it has received the Holy Spirit
Under the authority of the Holy Spirit, it can exercise its instrumental power to forgive or retain men's sins
The interpretation of any difficult passage in the Bible must be supported by enough proof and must take care of the context of the passage
A child of God may not need to expound every book of the Bible, but he must at least know the contents of each book
Once we become familiar with the contents of each book, we will know the nature of each book, and we will be able to relate one to the other
After we have a general grasp of all the books of the Bible, we should choose a few books and have an in-depth study of them
If possible, we should add another book from the Pentateuch to this list, either Exodus, Numbers, or Leviticus
Although some parts of Joseph's experience correspond to that of Christ, we cannot find one place that speaks of Joseph typifying Christ
Not only can we find persons who explicitly typify Christ, but we can find others who typify Him by correspondence
In the Old Testament Christ is also typified by the two birds, the two kings, the two priests, and the two forerunners
If we compile all the verses together and arrange them in order, we will find out what God has to say concerning these words
When the twelve spies returned from Canaan, they said, 'All the people that we saw in it are men of great size
If we serve God in His field as our Lord did, we spontaneously will be fed as we work because our food is to do the will of the Father
If we pick up several dozens of these terms, we will establish a foundation in the knowledge of the Bible for ourselves
Psalm 86 uses for eight times, Joshua 23 speaks of Jehovah your God thirteen times, and Ezra 7 speaks of seven things related to God
The Gospel of John together with John's Epistles speak of joy 'being full' six times: John 3:29; 15:11; 16:24; 17:13; 1 John 1:4; 2 John 12
Paul's Epistles use thanks be to God five times: Romans 6:17; 7:25; 1 Corinthians 15:57; 2 Corinthians 2:14; 9:15
In reading the Bible, we have to dig out these particular words and organize them into an outline of doctrines
They are 1 God the Father 2 the Son of God 3 the Holy Spirit 4 sin 5 redemption 6 the Christian life and living and 7 future events
Romans 1:4 also says, 'Who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead'
After we are finished with the doctrines of the Father and the Son, we can go on to the doctrine of the Holy Spirit
We must also deal with the subjects of sin, redemption, the living of God's children on earth today, and the future events one by one
Once we are clear about these seven things, we will have some degree of assurance concerning the fundamental teachings of the Bible
Every Bible reader should know one more thing: The Bible is God's revelation handed to us in many portions and in many ways
When we view it in the light of the total revelation today, we realize that the revelation to Abraham was not adequate
Sometimes God issued a commandment in a certain dispensation, yet this commandment was not meant to last for eternity
Many people have the misconception that the words in the Old Testament are only for men of the Old Testament age
Other people think that all Old Testament words are for us, and they take the entire Old Testament as eternal truth
In reading Genesis we find that God is the Creator, the Ruler, the Law-giver, the Judge, and also the Redeemer
From David and Solomon until the captivity to Babylon, we see monarchy, that is, God ruling over His people through kings
From the Babylonian captivity to the coming of the Lord Jesus, we have the rule of the prophets and the priests
In the second section, after the attestation of the Messiah, the subject of the kingdom of the heavens was raised
In the third section there is the vindication of the person of the Son of God, beginning from the Lord's feeding of the five thousand
John points out the Lord's feeding of bread to the five thousand for the purpose of proving that He is the Son of God
In reading the Gospels we should first identify these seven sections of the history of Christ, like setting the bearing of seven mountains
In the book of Acts we find three crucial things: 1) the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, 2) His reigning, and 3) His forgiveness
We have to note the order of Paul's letters in the Bible, as opposed to the chronological sequence of the writing of these letters
The rest of the Epistles, like Hebrews, James, 1 and 2 Peter, and Jude, are of a different nature; they have their own characteristics
These Epistles deal with miscellaneous issues involving a Christian; they do not contribute to any advance in revelation
The interesting thing is that after a subject is settled, nothing more is covered about the subject in subsequent books
