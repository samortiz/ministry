No. The Bible mentions not only prayer and petition but also thanksgiving. We must remember that everything that comes upon us has been placed in our hand by the nail-pierced hands; everything that comes upon us has been arranged by the Lord who died for us. Therefore, we can thank God ahead of time, saying, "God, You can never be wrong." There are many today who can preach and many today who can pray. But there are few who can give thanks. Preaching is giving something of God to man, while prayer is acquiring something from God. Thanksgiving is consecrating ourselves to God and offering our sacrifice of thanks. The Bible not only says that we should pray and petition; it also says that we should give thanks. In what things do we give thanks to God? We should not only give thanks to Him when we are happy; we should also give thanks when we are sorrowful. In everything we give thanks to God. We should thank God not only for the things that we consider as good, but also for the things that we consider to be bad.</P><P>There was a university professor in the western part of the United States who was always sad and liked to utter dejected words. This turned his colleagues away from him. One day the weather was very good, and a number of his younger colleagues said to him, "The sun is so bright today. The birds' chirping sounds are so sweet, and the grass looks so fresh. You ought to have no complaint about this scene." Looking around he was somewhat convinced that there was nothing to complain about. But did he stop his grievance? No. After a further glance he said, "This scene will not last." Oh, many Christians are like this man. They never have a heart of gratitude toward God. They only have sighings, murmurings, sorrows, and burdens; they never have a heart of gratitude.</P><P>There was a Christian who worked in a railroad station. He always gave thanks to God whether in sickness or in health and whether or not his circumstances were smooth. All of his co-workers said he was an optimist. One day while he was repairing the track of the railroad, a train ran over his leg and he fainted. After he regained consciousness, people heard him thanking God again! They were angry and wondered how he could still thank God when one of his legs was cut off. He said, "I thank God because I still have one good leg!" Brothers and sisters, you may be sick, but you are still alive. You may be poor, but you are not destitute. You may have coarse clothing, but you still have something to put on. Your house may be small, but you still have a place to lay your head. You should learn to seek for opportunities to thank God. If you do this, you may have reasons to be anxious, but you will not have opportunity to be anxious. Every time you give your anxiety and burden to God, you cannot help but rejoice. If you say that you have burdens and anxieties, you have to realize that the Lord has borne your sins on the cross. Will He not bear your sorrows, difficulties, and anxieties as well?</P><P>First Peter 5:7 says, "Casting all your anxiety on Him because it matters to Him concerning you." God wants us to cast all our anxiety on Him because it matters to Him concerning us. He wants to bear our burden. The word "matters" in the original language belongs to the same root as the word "anxiety" in the same verse; the two are different only in their grammatical forms. This means that God bears our anxieties; He takes up our anxiety for us. Therefore, we do not have to be anxious! Many people extend invitations to others with the purpose of receiving joy, gifts, friendship, and other things; they expect gain from others. But our God has not invited us to give Him joy, goodness, or friendship. He has invited us to come before Him and cast our anxieties on Him. God is a God who bears our anxiety. He beckons us to lay our anxiety on Him. To Him this is no hardship. Isaiah 53:4 said that the Lord Jesus has "borne our sicknesses and carried our sorrows."</P><P>If you worry about your immediate problems, the break up of your family, the moral degradation of your children and their waywardness from the Lord, the failure of your business, the frictions between in-laws, the salvation of others, or the backward and fallen spiritual condition of God's children, your should realize that God wants you to cast your anxiety on Him. In the midst of all these problems, God is asking you to come to Him. God is asking you to come not with your good things, but with your anxieties and worries. He will bear your anxieties. All of you who have a broken heart, a heavy heart, and a pained heart, come unto God! Today you need not be anxious anymore! This is the gospel.</P><P>What will be the result if we let our requests be made known to God in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving? There will be the best result. Philippians 4:7 says, "And the peace of God, which surpasses every man's understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus." The word "guard" in the original language is a special military term. We can translate it as "garrison" or "patrol." The same word is used in 2 Corinthians 11:32: "In Damascus, the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes in order to seize me." The governor of Damascus wanted to seize Paul, and he put garrisons of soldiers around the city. In the same way, God's peace is patrolling our heart like the soldiers garrisoning the city, and His peace is keeping our heart in peace. No anxiety can break through this line and come into our heart. God's peace is patrolling, garrisoning, and guarding our heart from the invasion of all anxieties. How amazing this is! What else could "the peace of God" possibly mean?</P><P>Originally, all of God's creation was wonderful and beautiful. But the archangel (who later became the devil) sinned, and one third of the angels followed him and also sinned. The earth became waste and void. Was God anxious about this? No. He finished His recovery work within six days and created a couple to live on the earth. Then they too committed sin. Was God anxious about this? No. Although the angels fell and man fell, God was not anxious. God sent forth the Savior to save men. According to our concept, as soon as man sinned, God should have sent forth the Savior. But God was not anxious. When the fullness of the time came, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman (Gal. 4:4). He waited several thousand years; He was not in a hurry. Even today, according to our concept, the best thing to do is to shuffle everybody into the church. But God is not in a hurry. This is the peace of God. Even if men attack Him, oppose Him, and deny Him, He does not send thunder and lightning to kill them. He is at peace. This is the peace of God. Although He encounters many adversities, He is still very much at peace. If we have such a peace of God to garrison our heart and mind, can anxiety invade us? Is there anything that can take away our peace?</P><P>God has commanded that we should let our requests be made known to Him in everything through prayer and petition with thanksgiving. He has promised that He will send us His own peace like soldiers guarding our hearts, keeping out all worries, sufferings, and discomforts. The peace of God indeed is the peace which passes all understanding; it is the peace which man cannot understand and cannot otherwise have. The phrase "surpasses every man's understanding" means beyond human expectation. If we commit everything to Him, we will have the peace which is beyond human understanding and which man cannot otherwise possess. This peace will guard our hearts and thoughts and enable us to safely pass through every storm in the worldly sea. Dear brothers, have you experienced the peace of God? Are you aware of the garrison of His peace? Do you know what it means for God's peace to guard your hearts and your thoughts? Thank God! Many times it seems that the pressure is too great and that there is no way of escape. It seems that anxiety and grief is your sole obligation. But when you tell God what you want, in prayer and petition, on the one hand, and with thanksgiving, on the other, you will feel as if you do not even know how to be anxious anymore. You will be surprised, and others will marvel at your peace. This is the peace which passes all understanding. This is the garrison of the peace of God.</P><P>Verse 7 also says, "Guard your hearts and your thoughts." This does not mean to guard your environment or keep your environment in peace. It means to keep your heart in peace. This sentence can also be translated as "making your hearts and thoughts belong to Jesus Christ." This means to turn your hearts and thoughts to the Lord. If you have any difficulty or pain which you cannot bear, you can say, "God, I commit this to Your hand." If you have obeyed His commandment, He will fulfill His promise.</P><P>Once, I encountered a difficulty which seemed to afford me no way out. At that time I remembered this verse, and I went to a deserted field to pray. I prayed more than ten times, but there was still no peace within. I thought, "Can it be that this verse is only good for others and cannot be put into practice by me?" At that point God told me, "I have said be anxious in nothing and you will have peace. But now you say that you have no peace!" I jumped up and said, "O God, You said that I have peace. I will surely have peace; I will not say anything anymore." When I believed God's words, I immediately had the peace. Therefore, brothers and sisters, if you do not believe God's Word, you will have no peace. Believe and you will have peace. If you want to wait for the peace before believing, you will never have it. If there is any difficulty or suffering beyond what you can bear, tell God, "O God, I commit them into Your hand." If you do this, you will have peace. "Rejoice in the Lord always" and "In nothing be anxious" are God's commandments. "And the peace of God, which surpasses every man's understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus" is His promise. If you obey His command, He will fulfill His promise.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 18: Notes on Scriptural Messages (2) &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
