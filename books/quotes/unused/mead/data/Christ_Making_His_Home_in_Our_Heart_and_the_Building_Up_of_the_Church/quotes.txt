[1]  Christ Making His Home in Our Heart and the Building Up of the Church CONTENTS
[2]  The contents include the meaning of regeneration, Christ making His home in the believers hearts, the experience of the Lord s word and the Lord s Spirit, the way of faith, and the building up of God s dwelling place, the church.
[3]  CHAPTER ONE MAN NEEDING TO BE REGENERATED Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 4; 10:10; 1 John 5:12; John 6:63 LIFE BEING AN IMPORTANT MATTER
[4]  John 1:1 says, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
[5]  Verse 4 says, In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.
[6]  First John 5:12 says, He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.
[7]  MAN HAVING ETERNAL LIFE Scripture Reading: John 1:1-4; 3:1-16 THE MEANING OF LIFE IN CREATION
[8]  In Genesis there is a clear picture explaining God s work of restoration and further creation in six days.
[9]  In chapter 2 we see the tree of life v. 9 , signifying that God came to be man s life in the form of food.
[10]  The forms of life progressed upward in three levels: from the plant life to the animal life, from oviparous life to viviparous life, and from viviparous life to human life, which is the highest form of created life.
[11]  In chapter 3, after speaking at length about being born anew, the Lord pointed out that the life we obtain from regeneration is the eternal life v. 36 . This eternal life is God Himself; it is also the life of God, the life signified by the tree of life.
[12]  We should never think that only fallen men need to be born again, or that a person who is not fallen would not need to be born again.
[13]  Even the best man is only human; he does not possess the element of God.
[14]  In order to see how man can obtain the highest life, God s life, we need to see that we are different from Adam when he was first in the garden of Eden.
[15]  In the beginning in the garden of Eden, Adam had the created human life but not the uncreated life of God.
[16]  Similarly, when we were born, we also had the created human life but not the uncreated life of God.
[17]  For the created man, Adam, to obtain God s life in the garden of Eden, all he had to do was eat the fruit of the tree of life and thereby contact God.
[18]  It is therefore not as simple for us to obtain God s life as it was for the created man, Adam, in the beginning.
[19]  If we would receive God s life, first of all the problems of sin need to be solved.
[20]  God could not allow a corrupted man, a man who had the element of Satan, to contact the tree of life and receive God s element and thereby live forever.
[21]  Even though God still needed to pass through incarnation, death, and resurrection in order for man to receive God s life, such a death would have only been a life-dispensing death, not a redemptive death as well.
[22]  CHAPTER FOUR WHAT IS REGENERATION THAT WHICH IS BORN OF THE SPIRIT BEING SPIRIT
[23]  John 3:3-8 is a record concerning regeneration: Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
[24]  Nicodemus said to Him, How can a man be born when he is old?
[25]  Hence, to see the kingdom of God is to enter into the kingdom of God, and to enter into the kingdom of God is to see the kingdom of God.
[26]  We must first understand that the words of the Lord Jesus were spoken to Nicodemus, who was a Pharisee.
[27]  The Lord spoke to Nicodemus in plain words, not in symbols.
[28]  When Nicodemus heard the Lord s words, he understood what they meant.
[29]  He did not bother to ask the Lord Jesus about the meaning of the word water.
[30]  In John 1:33, John the Baptist said, I did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize in water, He said to me, He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, this is He who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.
[31]  Then, not too long afterward, one of the Pharisees called Nicodemus went to see the Lord Jesus and confessed that the Lord Jesus had come from God as a teacher John 3:2 .
[32]  The Lord Jesus immediately responded, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God v. 3 . The Lord was telling Nicodemus that he needed to be born again.
[33]  What does it mean to be born of the Holy Spirit?
[34]  When a person believes in the Lord and confesses his sins, the Holy Spirit enters into him to enliven his human spirit.
[35]  It is through believing and repenting that we receive this spiritual fact, and it is through our going into death that we can come out of death and have God s life in us, thereby having a second birth and a second life.
[36]  Nicodemus thought that to be born again was to be born from his mother s womb a second time, but the Lord Jesus said that not only was Nicodemus unable to be born again from his mother s womb, but that even if he were able to enter into his mother s womb and be born again, he would still be born of the flesh and would still be flesh.
[37]  When some Christians experience an adverse situation or encounter difficulty, other people cannot tell that they are in any kind of turmoil.
[38]  This does not mean that these Christians do not have any feeling but that they do not express their feeling.
[39]  When the Lord makes His home in our heart, we will have His throne within us.
[40]  Every situation that is related to the New Jerusalem is under God s ruling v. 1 . Whether we are God s dwelling place and whether God is making His home in us depend on God s throne being in us and His having the right to rule over us.
[41]  If we still reserve legal rights to ourselves, that is, if we do not have the throne of God in us, He has not yet made home in our heart.
[42]  CHAPTER SIX WHERE I AM YOU ALSO MAY BE Scripture Reading: John 14:3, 10-11, 16-21, 23 JOHN 14
[43]  In John 14:3 the Lord said, If I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, so that where I am you also may be.
[44]  Verses 16 through 19 say, I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality...but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.
[45]  In verses 16 and 17 the Lord, the Father, and the Holy Spirit are mentioned.
[46]  Matthew 28:19 says, Baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[47]  Although we may not necessarily feel that the Holy Spirit is in us, if there is a change in our environment or we suffer persecution, the Spirit in us will come forth, and the Lord will be manifested.
[48]  This proves to the world that God is in us.
[49]  The Spirit who is in us is the Triune God in us, and nothing can shake, overcome, or subdue Him.
[50]  However, that is not the end. The Lord said, He who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will manifest Myself to him John 14:21 . Then He said, If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him v. 23 . We know that the Lord is in us, and that we are in the Lord, but we need to ask whether we have the Lord s manifestation.
[51]  THE SPIRIT AND THE WORD Scripture Reading: Eph 5:18-20; Col 3:16-17; 2 Tim 3:15-17; Jude 20; John 15:7; 6:63 CRUCIAL VERSES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT
[52]  Ephesians 5:18-20 says, Be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord, giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to our God and Father.
[53]  We praise God with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, and we give thanks to God in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[54]  And whatever you do in word or in deed, do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.
[55]  Ephesians says that our praising and giving of thanks are the result of our being filled in our spirit with the Holy Spirit, whereas Colossians says that our praising and giving of thanks are the result of our being filled richly with the Lord s word.
[56]  In the previous chapter we fellowshipped concerning the Lord s words in John 14:3: Where I am you also may be.
[57]  It is rather easy for those who are one with God and are mingled with God to have the Lord s manifestation and to have His making an abode with them.
[58]  Hence, the burden of this chapter is a continuation of our previous fellowship, which is, if we desire to have the Lord s manifestation regularly and to have His making an abode with us, we must deal with His word in a proper way.
[59]  If we would have the Lord s manifestation, the Lord s face, and have His making an abode with us, we must have a proper attitude when dealing with the word, and we must have a proper relationship with the word.
[60]  Ephesians says that when the believers are filled with the Holy Spirit in their spirit, they are able to praise and thank the Lord, whereas Colossians says that when the believers are filled with the Lord s word, they can praise and thank the Lord.
[61]  John 1:1 says that the Word was God, 4:24 says that God is Spirit, and 6:63 says that the Lord s words are spirit.
[62]  If we would have a proper attitude toward the Lord and His word, we must see that the Word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is God.
[63]  Second Timothy 3:16 says, All Scripture is God-breathed.
[64]  We may also say that the word of the Scripture is the Spirit, because God is Spirit and what He breathes out is also Spirit.
[65]  Since the Bible is God-breathed, God s breathing out, the words in the Bible convey God.
[66]  In order to have a proper attitude toward the Lord s word, we must learn to pray in the Holy Spirit so that we may be filled with the Holy Spirit.
[67]  PRAYING AND READING THE BIBLE IN A PROPER WAY
[68]  We must learn to pray and read the Bible in our spirit.
[69]  This is not a ritual of kneeling down, closing our eyes, and saying, Lord Jesus, I thank and praise You for giving me peace and keeping me from having a car accident.
[70]  These are done outside of the Holy Spirit and cannot help us touch God nor help us eat the Lord and drink the Lord.
[71]  The Lord in us, the Holy Spirit in us, and the word in us will enable us to pray in the Lord s feeling and according to His desire.
[72]  CHAPTER EIGHT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF BREAKING BREAD LIFE AND BUILDING Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 10:16-17, 21b; 11:17-29 THE TWO ASPECTS OF THE SIGNIFICANCE
[73]  God entered into us to be our life so that we can be built up together.
[74]  Hence, God s intention with man has two crucial aspects: He desires man to receive Him as life, and by means of this life and through this life, He builds us up into a corporate entity.
[75]  If we comprehend the significance of the Lord s setting up of His table, we will see that according to His intention, the matter of breaking bread includes life and building.
[76]  When we take the bread into us, we should also use our spirit to receive the Lord Jesus as the bread of life into us.
[77]  If in our remembrance of the Lord, we merely think of Him and praise Him, without receiving Him and enjoying Him, then our remembrance of Him is lacking, and we have not touched the intention of His heart.
[78]  We need to see these two aspects of the bread.
[79]  The second aspect is that since we have the life of the Lord Jesus, we are part of His mystical Body.
[80]  Whenever we break bread, we should sense that we are receiving the Lord and enjoying the Lord.
[81]  The bread also signifies the Lord s mystical Body, the church, which He obtained through regenerating us with His resurrection life.
[82]  Hence, when we see the bread, we remember that the Lord Jesus gave Himself up on the cross for us.
[83]  When we receive the bread, we not only enjoy and receive the Lord; we also receive all the saints.
[84]  In receiving the bread, we declare that we enjoy not only the Lord but also all the saved ones.
[85]  In 1 Corinthians 10 Paul says, The bread which we break, is it not the fellowship of the body of Christ? v. 16 . In this verse Paul is not referring to the physical body of the Lord Jesus that hung on the cross for us but to the mystical Body that the Lord Jesus obtained in resurrection.
[86]  We see this in the next verse, which says, Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one Body; for we all partake of the one bread v. 17 . Though we are many, we are still one bread, one Body.
[87]  We all must admit that every saved one has Christ in him.
[88]  When we look at the earthen vessels instead of Christ, we feel that the saints are full of problems, and as a result, we dislike them, are bothered by them, criticize them, and judge them.
[89]  HIS MANIFESTATION AND HIS ABIDING Scripture Reading: John 14:19-23; Exo 33:14
[90]  In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.
[91]  In these verses the Lord said that after He resurrected from the dead, He would regenerate us by entering into us to be our life.
[92]  Therefore, we live because He lives; we live in His resurrection life with Him.
[93]  This is the reason we will know that the Lord is in the Father and is one with the Father, that we are in the Lord and are one with the Lord, and that the Lord is in us and is one with us.
[94]  What kind of living should we have after we are saved?
[95]  After we are saved, the Lord should continually manifest Himself to us.
[96]  Any dispute between us and the Lord in which we defeat the Lord instead of letting Him defeat us, proves that we do not love Him enough.
[97]  There are two sides to the Lord making an abode with us: His coming to abide in us and our abiding in Him.
[98]  The Lord s manifestation is a matter of joy, whereas His making an abode in us is a matter of rest.
[99]  If we love the Lord and obey His commandments so that there is no barrier between us, and we obey all that He asks of us, we will have the Lord s manifestation, and we will have joy within.
[100]  LOOKING AWAY UNTO JESUS Scripture Reading: Heb 10:32-39; 11:1 12:3
[101]  Hebrews 10:38-39 says, My righteous one shall live by faith; and if he shrinks back, My soul does not delight in him.
[102]  But we are not of those who shrink back to ruin but of them who have faith to the gaining of the soul.
[103]  Verses 1 and 2 of chapter 12 say, Therefore let us also, having so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, put away every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us and run with endurance the race which is set before us, looking away unto Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of our faith.
[104]  The Lord tries the faith of those who serve Him.
[105]  In the future we will be placed into periods of longer and more difficult trials.
[106]  They will cause us to lose our interest in serving the Lord, to lose our sense of the sweetness in taking this way, and to even lose our sense of encouragement from the Lord.
[107]  Paul says that we are those who have faith to the gaining of the soul v. 39 . The saving, or gaining, of our soul does not refer to eternal salvation.
[108]  The saving of our body will take place at the Lord s return, when our body will be redeemed and transfigured.
[109]  Revelation shows the position and glory of the Lord Jesus in God s plan, whereas Hebrews shows who the Lord Jesus is in the believers life of faith.
[110]  CHAPTER TWELVE GRACE, MERCY, AND BLESSING Scripture Reading: Heb 4:14-16 GOD S WILL BEING CONTRARY TO MAN S CONCEPT
[111]  Few Bible readers understand the book of Job Job was written from the standpoint of human adversities.
[112]  The book of Job was written on the human level, but it also reveals God s intention for man in his adversities.
[113]  At the end of the book of Job God comes in and says that all the words spoken by Job and his three friends were words without knowledge.
[114]  He prayed three times, asking the Lord to remove the thorn, but the Lord said, My grace is sufficient for you v. 9 . The Lord seemed to be saying, I will not remove the thorn, because if I do, you will depend on your strength and not on grace.
[115]  If we were not degraded and fallen, we would have no need for God s mercy.
[116]  However, in our degraded and fallen condition, we need God s mercy, which reaches us and brings us into a situation in which He is able to favor us with His grace.
[117]  Peter, who denied the Lord three times, would not have been able to receive grace without God s mercy.
[118]  The more we live before God and follow Him, the more we will know mercy, grace, and blessing and will realize that what we have is worthless before God.
[119]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN LEARNING LESSONS FROM OUR TRIALS LEARNING TO RECEIVE MERCY
[120]  We enjoy the Lord s blessing, but we hope that the blessing we enjoy will extend to other places, not only to other places in Taiwan.
[121]  LEARNING THE LESSONS FROM OUR TRIALS Needing to Pass through Trials
[122]  The saints who are serving are still passing through trials.
[123]  This is something we all experience in following the Lord, because we all must pass through trials.
[124]  When we are saved, we sense the sweetness of God s salvation, and our feeling is fresh.
[125]  Furthermore, we have the full assurance that God exists, that the Lord is our Savior, that we have been forgiven of our sins, and that we have been regenerated.
[126]  Many of you are passing through trials, and you are testing your faith.
[127]  Your way, your living, and your pursuit have become trials to you, and you are being tested in these matters.
[128]  OF GOD S DWELLING PLACE Scripture Reading: Exo 25:8; 26:15, 26-30; 29:45-46; 40:17 THE CENTRAL REVELATION IN GENESIS AND EXODUS
[129]  When we read Genesis and Exodus, we need to pay attention to the central revelation of God.
[130]  Without this revelation, it is not easy to see God s intention in Genesis.
[131]  All saved ones can testify that God s presence is in the meetings of the church.
[132]  Of course, we also have God s presence when we pray and when we read the Bible.
[133]  However, we know that those experiences cannot equal the presence of God that we experience in the meetings of the church.
[134]  When we pray, we have the Lord s presence.
[135]  Sometimes we do not remember the message we heard in a meeting, but we know that we touched the presence of God, and thus the glory of Jehovah filled our midst.
[136]  Furthermore, in order for a board to stand, it cannot depend on only one tenon.
[137]  If there were only one tenon, the board would spin, but with two tenons, the board could not spin.
