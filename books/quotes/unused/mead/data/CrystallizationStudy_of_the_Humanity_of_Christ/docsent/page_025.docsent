   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Nathanael recognized Jesus as the Son of God John 1:49 , but Jesus told Nathanael that he would see the angels ascending and descending upon the Son of Man v. 51 . Christ as the Son of Man is the reality of the ladder which Jacob saw in Genesis 28:12.</S>

   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This heavenly ladder is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have seen that the New Jerusalem as the goal of God's economy is the universal incorporation of the consummated God with His regenerated believers.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sitting is for resting, whereas standing is for working.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because a member of His Body was suffering on this earth, the Son of Man was seen standing at the right hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This indicates that the Lord was greatly concerned for His persecuted one.</S>
