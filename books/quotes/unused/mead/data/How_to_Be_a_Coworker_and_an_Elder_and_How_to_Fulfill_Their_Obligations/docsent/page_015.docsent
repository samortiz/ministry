   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This Life-giving Spirit "Was Not Yet" before the Resurrection of Christ the Glorification of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>John 7:39 says, "...for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In my youth, when I read this portion of the Word, I wondered why "the Spirit was not yet."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Had not the Spirit of God already been there for a long time?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Does not Genesis 1:2 say that the Spirit of God was moving upon the face of the waters?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then in the Old Testament, in God's relationship with man, the Spirit of Jehovah is mentioned Judg.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After many years of study, I became clear that indeed Jesus was glorified when He was resurrected Luke 24:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Before He was resurrected, that is, before He was glorified, the Spirit of God was not the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Before the resurrection of Christ, the Spirit of God could move upon the face of the waters, could contact people, and could sanctify people, but He could not impart life into people, because He was not yet the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The title the Spirit of life was not mentioned until Romans 8:2.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, prior to the resurrection of Christ, the Spirit was not yet means that there was not yet the life-giving Spirit.</S>
