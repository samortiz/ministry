	 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">FORMING SMALL GROUPS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">OUR MEETINGS BEING LIKE OUR HOME LIFE</h2>
<p>We should not imitate the practice of Christianity in our meetings. For over thirty years we have encouraged the brothers and sisters to exercise their spirit and to function in the meetings. The Bible does not speak of someone presiding over or taking the lead in Christian meetings. First Corinthians 14:26 says, &ldquo;Whenever you come together, each one has...&rdquo; In this verse the first thing that the saints have is a psalm, which means that when the saints gather together, anyone can call a hymn. Our meetings should be as comfortable as our home life because we have been in meetings together for many years, just like a family. We should not be unfamiliar with the things that we need to do in a meeting, such as exercising our spirit and functioning.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Singing Hymns<br />
Not Only Loudly and Clearly<br />
but Also in a Refined Manner</h2>
<p>Many among us are not familiar with how to sing hymns in a meeting. When I heard you sing, &ldquo;Thy dwelling-place, O Lord, I love; / It is Thy Church so blessed&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #852), I sensed a lack of refinement in the use of this hymn. When we sing hymns, we should not only be loud and clear in our singing but also refined in our enjoyment. For example, after singing each stanza, there could be a short prayer of longing and enjoyment: &ldquo;O Lord! I love Your dwelling place. I love Your church; she is Your joy and heart&rsquo;s delight, and she is also where my heart finds rest.&rdquo; Or we could pray, &ldquo;O Lord! The church is so lovely. As we come here, our hearts are joyful; once we are here, our hearts find rest.&rdquo; After such a simple prayer, our feeling will be quite different when we sing the next stanza. Every stanza should be the pouring out of our feelings from within, expressing our appreciation to the Lord. In this matter, we need to practice until we are more skillful.</p>
<p>In the Christian college where I studied, there was a one hour worship service Monday through Saturday at 11:30 A.M. During this time, sermons were given in English by Western pastors. Some of the pastors would speak regardless of whether the students understood or not. Since we could not leave early, we suffered through this time, looking at our watches and waiting for the meeting to be dismissed. This is the situation in Christianity, but our meetings should not be like this. When we worship the Lord, our spirit is refreshed. We not only should worship and enjoy the Lord; we should also testify to Him of our enjoyment. This speaks of the importance of singing hymns.</p>
<p>When we meet, we should be like players on a basketball court. In particular, when singing hymns, one person should not shout the words repeatedly and continuously. This would be like one person dribbling the ball all the time. We have been meeting for many years, and we have many meetings every year. Hence, we have many opportunities for everyone to practice.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Needing to Exercise the Spirit<br />
in the Meeting</h2>
<p>At the end of 1962, I received a burden from the Lord to start the work in the United States, and I began the work by stressing the exercise of the spirit. The American saints surely know how to exercise their spirit. In the meetings one hundred fifty saints can be &ldquo;playing basketball,&rdquo; not just five. In the meetings they &ldquo;pass the ball&rdquo; from one person to another. Moreover, their meetings have reached a point where there is no formal calling of hymns, no preaching, and even no announcement to start the meeting; the meetings just begin spontaneously. The first person who comes to the meeting begins to pray, and when another comes, he begins to pray as well. There are no long prayers; instead, everyone follows each other with prayers that are two or three sentences in length but which are full of the Spirit.</p>
<p>We have not yet entered into this kind of exercise in the Far East. It seems as if we are still in our old culture. May the Lord forgive us. I hope that 1985 would be a new beginning. We need more practice. For example, we should practice singing hymns with two or three saints, and pray after each stanza. We also should be willing to critique one another so that there would be greater benefit.</p>
<p>God can accomplish whatever He desires to accomplish; He does not need to practice, because He does not need to learn. But since we are not God, we need to learn and practice. Even though I am eighty years old this year, I still need to learn. I have many dictionaries in many languages, and I use them whenever I write because I still need to learn. We need to learn in order to glorify the Lord.</p>
