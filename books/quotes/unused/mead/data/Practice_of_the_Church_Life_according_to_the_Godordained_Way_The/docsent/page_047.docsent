   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When we come to the meetings, as Christians we must move as transformed persons, not as persons who act.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When he acts, an actor dresses himself and conducts himself in a manner that is different from what he is normally.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When a young actor portrays an old man, he alters his appearance so that he looks like an old man, and he moves, gestures, and speaks to people like an old man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>That is acting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But we need to drop everything that is false and simply be what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, we should not be what we are in the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should be what we are in transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Formerly, we might have been a clever person who hid himself all the time, but the Lord has transformed us, so we act, move, walk, and work as a transformed member in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, when we come to the meeting, we must be active; this is not only our duty and our responsibility but also our obligation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the reason that we all need to be trained.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When they prophesy, those who are timid must get out of their timidity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, their speaking in a bold way should not be a performance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They should conduct themselves in this way all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some saints like to begin their speaking by saying, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Praise the Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This has become a slogan in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should avoid this, especially in the beginning of our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To begin our speaking we should have a fitting noun as a subject and a proper verb as a predicate.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This will make our speaking more meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As an illustration of the proper way to begin a speaking, we may open in this way: "As Christians we need to be transformed in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Formerly, we thought that in the matter of meeting we did not need to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Actually, we need to be transformed even more in the way of meeting."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is a good beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>With such a proper beginning, many things will come out in the remainder of our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At times we may have a proper thought with the proper line and the proper points for our speaking, but we also need to learn how to compose our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The opening word in our speaking is very crucial because it controls the speaking that follows it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we use an outline in our speaking, when we stand up to speak, we should not drop our head to look at our outline.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That kills our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before 1974 I did not use an outline in my speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I began to use an outline when I conducted the life-study trainings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For each of those trainings I wrote a set of outlines.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brother T. Austin-Sparks always spoke from points he had written in a notebook.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once while I was interpreting for him during a visit he made to Taiwan, I noticed that he spoke everything according to his notes, but a person sitting far off could not realize that he was using notes.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He had a skillful way to use the notes but not let people notice.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we speak with an outline, we should avoid dropping our head and looking down at the outline before speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We all have our natural way, and we not only allow our natural way to act, but we also trust in our natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In learning how to meet, we should continually annul our natural way and learn the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is easy to meet in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To do this we do not need to learn or be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, to meet in the God-ordained way, we need to be dealt with; our natural way must be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to drop our natural way and learn to be crucified in relation to speaking by our natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then we will be transformed.</S>
