This book is mainly of three sections. The first section is on redemption, the second section is on life, and the third section is on building, that is, the church life. In the middle, between redemption and building, is life. Life is the central thing.</P><P>Life may be a term which is familiar to a number of Christians, but not many can define or realize what life really is in their experience. To talk about life in doctrine is easy, but to say something about life from our experience is difficult. In these messages we have the burden to see what life is in our experience.</P><P>In the section of Romans which is on life, there are two key terms: the flesh and the spirit. Christians mostly pay attention only to the Holy Spirit, not to our human spirit. Yet we have to realize that in this section our human spirit is more practical to us than the Holy Spirit. Two things are the key to the real experience of life: our flesh and our spirit. On the negative side, we have to know the flesh. On the positive side, we have to experience our human spirit, which has been mingled with the divine Spirit (Rom. 8:16; 1 Cor. 6:17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FLESH BEING THE CORRUPTED, POLLUTED,<br>AND TRANSMUTED BODY</H2><P>It is hard to define what the flesh is in a practical way. We need to see that the flesh is the corrupted, polluted, and transmuted body. Originally, it was the body created by God to contain our human being. Our human being is contained in our physical body, and this physical body was created by God in a pure way. But when man fell, Satan in the form of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil got into man. That entrance of Satan into man was his entering into man's body. Man ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and anything that man eats gets into his physical body.</P><P>Our body, which contains our inner being, was created as a pure, clean, and good vessel. But one day God's enemy came in to inject himself into man by the way of man's eating. Man ate of the tree of knowledge, and the actuality and reality of that tree got into man's physical body. At that time some strange, foreign element came into man's body. Man's body was originally pure. But since Satan injected himself into man, man's body has another element, a foreign element, added to it and it has become flesh. Thus, the flesh has two elements&#151;one element created by God and another element, the element that is Satan himself. This other element is not just something evil of Satan or by Satan. This element is the evil Satan himself. By this we can see that something foreign, something strange, something other than God's creation, got into man's body created by God. All the ethical and moral teachings in human religion and human culture never touch this point because they do not have the revelation concerning man's flesh. The Scriptures show that the flesh is our polluted and transmuted body.</P><P>Have you ever realized that your flesh is a polluted thing? Regardless of how good a person you may be, you still have the flesh. You may be the best person, but your flesh is not better than anyone else's. Do not say that you have a better flesh than someone else. Flesh is just flesh. Your flesh is no good. You might think you are a good person, but it is certain that your flesh is no good. Your flesh has been corrupted and polluted by Satan. Satan as a foreign element got into your body. This is the reason that the Bible tells us the flesh is full of lusts (Rom. 13:14; Gal. 5:16; 1 Pet. 2:11). The lusts are of the flesh. The flesh is the totality of all kinds of lusts. No lust is good. All lusts are bad.</P><P>I do not care how nice a person you may be. You may be a gentleman or a lady, a good boy or a good girl, but as long as you are a human being, you have a very bad, ugly, polluted flesh. No one has good flesh. You may say that you have been saved and sanctified and that you are holy, a saint. You may be a saint, but you still have the flesh. Our flesh is corrupted with Satan himself. The flesh is the corrupted, transmuted body. We need our body to exist, but our body is fallen, transmuted, corrupted, and polluted. Our body today is the flesh.</P><P>Romans 6:6 tells us that our body today is "the body of sin." It is not the body of righteousness. Romans 7:24 says that our body is "the body of this death." Our body today is not only the body of sin but also the body of death. Sin and death always go together. Sin is the husband and death is the wife. They never have a divorce. Death always goes along with sin. There was no need for Paul to teach that sin as the husband should love death and that death as the wife should submit itself to sin. Sin surely loves death, and death is all the time submitted to sin. They always go together. In a church meeting, a brother may sit on the front row while his wife sits on the back row. But sin and death are not like this. Wherever sin sits, death sits also.</P><P>Our body is a body of sin and death. Do you love your body? We need to buffet our body (1 Cor. 9:27). Our body is the flesh because it is no longer pure. Regardless of how much we pray and walk with the Lord, we have to realize that right beside our inner being this ugly thing, the body of sin and death, is here with us all the time. As long as we are still living, until the day of our redemption, the body of sin and death is always with us. Romans puts three things together: the flesh, sin, and death.</P><P>Romans 8:2 speaks of the law of sin and of death. One law is of these two things. This proves that sin and death are really one. Verse 6 says that the mind set on the flesh is death. Where the flesh is, there is death. Romans 8:3 speaks of the likeness of the flesh of sin. The flesh and sin are one. We must see that sin, death, and the flesh are three in one. Where sin is, there is death, and where the flesh is, there is sin. Sin is always with death, and the flesh is always with sin. These three things can never be separate from one another. If you have one, you have all three. If you have death, you have sin. If you have sin, you have the flesh. If you have the flesh, be assured that you have sin and death. These three things are one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SIN BEING SATAN HIMSELF IN OUR FLESH</H2><P>Now we need to see what sin is. Sin is not evil deeds such as hating and killing others. These are outward doings. They are not sin itself. Sin itself, according to the Bible's revelation, is Satan himself. When sin came into the created man, Satan came into him. We can use the illustration of a black bookmark being placed within a book. The book may be likened to something created by God and the black bookmark to sin being placed within it. One day, Satan got into man. Sin is Satan getting into you.</P><P>Sin is a living person. Romans says that sin can deceive us, kill us (7:11), and lord it over us, that is, have dominion over us (6:12, 14). All these activities prove that sin is a living person. This living person is Satan. Satan outside of you is not sin. When Satan gets into you, that is sin. Satan in you is sin. We have to realize where Satan is in our being. He is in our flesh.</P><P>Paul said in Romans 7 that he practiced what he hated (v. 15). Since this was the case, he said, "It is no longer I that work it out, but sin that dwells in me" (v. 17). Paul used the phrase no longer I twice. In Galatians 2:20 he said, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me." In Romans 7 he said, "It is no longer I..but sin that dwells in me." Sin is another person within us. I may like to do something, but eventually I do not do it. Instead, I do what I hate. So it is no longer I, but another person who does it. This person is in my flesh. Paul said, "I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells" (v. 18). In my flesh no good thing dwells, because the flesh is fully possessed, taken over, by Satan as sin.</P><P>Some people do not believe that there is such a person as Satan in this universe. They do not know that this person, whom they do not believe exists, is in their flesh. They do not believe that Satan exists and they do not know that while they are saying this, Satan is speaking in their speaking. They speak for Satan, whom they do not believe exists. Satan is in man's flesh.</P><P>We have shown that the flesh is our corrupted body. The flesh also refers to the corrupted human beings. Romans 3:20 says that by the law no flesh can be justified. The word flesh here does not refer to our polluted body but to our fallen being. By the works of the law no human being, no fallen one, can be justified. That means none of the people who are flesh can be justified. In God's eyes human beings are altogether flesh. Genesis 6:3 tells us that at a certain point in the eyes of God, man became flesh.</P><P>Man is totally flesh because the fallen being today is under the dominion of the fallen flesh. Every human being today in society is dominated by his flesh. Who sends people to Las Vegas into the casinos? Who sends people to the movie theaters? The flesh sends them. In God's eyes we are totally flesh. In God's eyes we are no longer mere human beings, but we are flesh, which has been possessed, saturated, taken over, and mingled with Satan.</P><P>Look at today's society. Everyone is flesh. Outwardly, men behave like gentlemen; inwardly, they are flesh. Outwardly, women behave like ladies; inwardly, they are flesh. The husband is flesh; the wife is flesh; the boy is flesh; the girl is flesh; the gentleman is flesh; the executive is flesh; the janitor is flesh. Everyone is flesh, because everyone is under the dominion of Satan, having been corrupted by him.</P><P>We all have to see that Satan as sin is in the flesh and that sin is Satan getting into man. In this flesh there is also death. The definition of death is weakness. When we are weak to the uttermost, that is death. Death is weakness. Many times we try to do good. We want to be holy persons. But when we try to do good, we fail. Some of the young brothers who live in a brothers' house may think that the Lord's intention is for them to learn to be patient. They are ready to learn the lesson of patience. But actually they are ready to lose their patience. Paul said, "To will is present with me, but to work out the good is not" (Rom. 7:18). This is weakness, and weakness is death.</P><P>Even in spiritual things we discover death. We realize that all the members of the Body should function. Before we come to the church meeting, we may make up our mind to function. But we find out that to will is present; but to do it is not. When we come to the meeting, we sense the weakening. That weakening is death. Death is working; death is day by day affecting us.</P><P>Human beings today are not living. Actually, everyone is dying. Eventually, everyone will die. We have to realize that every person is a dying person because death is working in everyone. In particular, death is working in our flesh. If we lose our temper for one minute, this may deaden us for three days. We cannot pray, have morning watch, or read the Bible, because we are being deadened by our sin.</P><P>Sin is another title for Satan. Sin goes together with death, and Satan is the one that holds the might of death, the power of death, as mentioned in Hebrews 2:14. Now we can see these three things: sin, death, and Satan. They are all together in the flesh. The flesh is the "meeting hall" of sin, death, and Satan. They always meet here, and their meeting lasts so long that they would never have a dismissal. Many of us spend our time attending the meetings of the church in the church meeting hall. Satan also has a meeting hall. The meeting hall of Satan is our flesh. Do you like to see Satan? Just come to your flesh. Satan is here. Satan is always in the flesh with sin and death.</P><P>We need to see how bad the flesh is. First, the flesh is at enmity with God. Second, this flesh is not subject to the law of God. It is always in rebellion against the law of God. Third, this flesh is unable to be subject to the law of God (Rom. 8:7). It has a nature which cannot possibly be subject to the law of God. Thus, we should not try to do good by our flesh, because our flesh cannot be subject to the law of God. Fourth, this flesh can never please God (v. 8).</P><P>Now we might ask, "What shall we do with this flesh?" According to Galatians, we have to crucify our flesh (5:24). But Paul told us in Romans that we first have to realize that there is such a thing as the flesh. Even now we have this flesh, which is the transmuted body, polluted and corrupted within. This flesh is filled up with Satan, sin, and death. The flesh, Satan, sin, and death are one. We should not think that we have anything good or that we have any possibility of being good. We must be enlightened to see that our flesh is an ugly thing. We have to condemn it, not try to improve it. Some Christians get deceived into thinking that after they are saved, their flesh has been recovered. But God would never recover the flesh. Our flesh is a hopeless case. We should not have any kind of positive expectation concerning our flesh. We have to realize that the flesh is sin.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING FORCED BY THE FLESH TO TURN TO THE SPIRIT</H2><P>Now I would like us to see that this flesh eventually is good for us. How is it good for us? It is good for us because it forces us to go to the spirit. We have something so bad and so evil that we can never deal with it, yet it would never go away. It is always here.</P><P>Many years ago I read a number of books telling me the ways to be holy and victorious. I tried these ways. At first they worked a little bit, but for the long run, none of these ways worked. As a result, I became fully disappointed. I found out that this poor flesh is hopeless. I wondered why the Lord would not take away our flesh. I thought that if He would take away the flesh, everything would be okay.</P><P>On the cross Christ terminated everything, but we may wonder why He still left this ugly flesh with us. It seems that the more we pray to deal with the flesh, the more we are bothered by the flesh and the more active our flesh is. It seems that we can never overcome the flesh. Eventually, I told the Lord, "Since You do not take away my flesh, I will not try to be good any longer. I give up trying to be good. I give up trying to be victorious." The Lord told me, "Child, that's wonderful. That's exactly what I want you to do. You have to give up trying to overcome the flesh." Eventually, the Lord showed me that He left the flesh with us for our good because it helps us and forces us to turn to Him, to turn to the spirit.</P><P>If we did not have such an evil thing as the flesh with us, we might not pray so desperately. This flesh helps us and forces us to call on the Lord. We are forced by the hopeless flesh to turn to our spirit. If we do not turn to the Lord, this is really bad. But if the flesh forces us to turn to the Lord, this is really good. We can say, "Thank You, Lord, for the help from the flesh. Thank You, Lord, that You can even be so sovereign to use my flesh to force me to turn to my spirit." Are you still bothered by the flesh? You had better say, "Praise the Lord. The flesh helps me and forces me to turn to the spirit."</P><P>We have to realize that the flesh and the spirit are very close to each other. Romans 8:6 says that to set our mind upon the flesh is death, but to set our mind upon the spirit is life. Verse 4 says that we are to walk according to the spirit, not according to the flesh. Romans 8:10 says that if Christ is in us, our body is dead. That means our body is flesh. But if the Spirit dwells in us, our spirit is life. We can see from these verses that the Bible puts the flesh so close to the spirit.</P><P>Even if you have been saved for a long time and have been with the Lord in a deeper way, these two things are absolutely with you. The flesh is with you and the spirit is with you. Our flesh is the embodiment of Satan. Sin and death are within our flesh. But praise the Lord that we also have a spirit within us!</P><P>There is such a person by the name of Satan in this universe. Satan is in our flesh, Satan is sin, and sin brings in death. The flesh, Satan, sin, and death are one. God has no intention to take away the flesh until we are matured. When we become mature, we will no longer need the help of the flesh. The flesh is here helping us and forcing us to turn to the spirit. We should not be disappointed. We have the flesh, but we also have to say, "Praise the Lord! I also have the spirit."</P><P>On the one hand, we hate our flesh; but on the other hand, we praise the Lord for the "helping flesh." I trusted in the Lord so much after I realized that my flesh was a hopeless case. From the day I discovered that my flesh was a hopeless case, I was fearful and trembling, looking to the Lord and turning to the spirit in doing everything. I was on the alert to say, "Lord, You have to come in. You have to keep me in Your care. You have to keep me in the realm of the spirit; otherwise, if I am a little careless, I will be in the flesh."</P><P>We must realize that the flesh is a hopeless case. The ethical Christians, the moral Christians, will tell people how to deal with and overcome their lusts. But the Bible only reveals to us that the lusts are within the flesh and that the flesh is a hopeless case. It is useful only in helping us and forcing us to turn to our spirit to trust in the Lord. This is not merely in the ethical or moral realm. This is a matter absolutely of turning from the flesh to the spirit.</P><P>We all need to turn from the flesh to the spirit. We need to realize that the flesh is a hopeless case and that it is here for our good. It is here helping us and forcing us all the time, moment by moment, to turn to the spirit, to trust in the Lord, and to have no confidence any longer in our flesh (Phil. 3:3).</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PRACTICALITY OF TURNING<br>TO CHRIST IN OUR SPIRIT</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Zech. 12:1; Job. 32:8; Prov. 20:27; John 3:6b; 4:24; Rom. 1:9a; 8:16, 15, 4, 6, 9-10; 2 Tim. 4:22; Gal. 6:18</H1><P>The Christian life seems to be very mysterious and abstract, but Paul made it practical by speaking about the flesh on the negative side and the spirit on the positive side. This is the human spirit, not the Holy Spirit. The human flesh and the human spirit are the keys to the practical Christian life. If we are going to experience life in a practical way, we must be clear about the flesh and the spirit.</P><P>Not many Christians today are clear about these two things. We may have read Romans 6&#151;8 and may be familiar with the flesh and the spirit as terms, but what we need is a heavenly vision, a divine revelation. Many Christians have read through Romans 8 and have seen the Holy Spirit, but they have not seen that there is another spirit in this chapter. Verse 16 says, "The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit." This verse speaks of the Holy Spirit and our spirit, the human spirit.</P><P>Christians mostly pay their attention to the first Spirit, the Holy Spirit. But we cannot realize the Holy Spirit without our human spirit. Regardless of how wonderful the Holy Spirit is, we must have the proper organ, our human spirit, to realize Him. If we do not have eyes, we cannot realize what light, colors, and beautiful scenery are. Our eyes are the proper organ to realize these things. If we did not have our ears as a listening organ, we would not be able to realize or substantiate any sounds. God is Spirit. If we did not have our spirit, we could not substantiate Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SATAN, SIN, AND DEATH BEING IN THE FLESH</H2><P>In the previous chapter, we saw that Satan, sin, and death are all in the flesh. We must be able to present the verses from the Scripture which prove this. Romans 7:17 says, "It is no longer I that work it out, but sin that dwells in me," and verse 18 says, "I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells." These two verses show that sin dwells in the flesh.</P><P>Now we need to consider how we can say that sin is Satan. Verse 21 says, "I find then the law with me who wills to do the good, that is, the evil is present with me." When sin is dormant within us, it is merely sin, but when it is aroused in us by our willing to do the good, it becomes "the evil." That means sin is the evil and the evil is sin. In the New Testament Satan has another title, and this title is "the evil." In John 17 the Lord prayed that the disciples would be kept from "the evil one," but in the Greek text the word one is not there (v. 15). Who is "the evil"? The evil is Satan and evil is sin, so sin is Satan.</P><P>Sin in Romans is a living person, because sin can kill us, deceive us (7:11), and lord it over us (6:12, 14). It is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells in me. I am a person, and sin is also a person. In Galatians 2:20 Paul said, "It is no longer I...but...Christ who lives in me." Within me, the person, there is another Person&#151;Christ. Also within me, that is, in my flesh, there is another person. This person is sin, and sin is Satan. Sin is Satan dwelling in us, and death is one with sin. Romans 8:2 speaks of the law of sin and death. So as long as you have sin, you have death. These three things&#151;Satan, sin, and death&#151;are all in the flesh.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>APPLYING THE LORD IN OUR SPIRIT<br>IN OUR DAILY LIFE</H2><P>Our flesh is impure. It is a mixture, a compound. A compound is composed of several elements. Our flesh has been compounded with Satan, sin, and death. Have you ever realized that today our flesh is such a mysterious, terrible compound? Our human spirit is also a compound, but it is a compound in a good sense. In our spirit is Jesus Christ. Second Timothy 4:22 says, "The Lord be with your spirit." Not only so, in our spirit is the grace of God. Galatians 6:18 says, "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit."</P><P>We may say that the Lord is in our spirit, but in our daily life we do not apply Him. When I was young, not many homes in mainland China had electricity installed in them. One day electricity was installed in our home, but from my youth I had been using the oil lamp day after day. For quite a number of days after the installation of electricity, I would still go to light the oil lamp out of habit. Then when I remembered that we had electricity, I stopped what I was doing and turned on the light. I knew there was electricity installed in my home and that there were electrical lights hanging from the ceiling, but I forgot to turn on the electricity because I was not used to it.</P><P>A number of us have heard messages about Jesus Christ being with our spirit. We may be excited about this, but when we are in our daily life, we forget. We are like someone who picks up the matches and tries to light the oil lamp when he has electricity in his home. We are not accustomed to going to Christ in our spirit. We are used to approaching Him as the One who is high in the third heaven. We are not used to going directly to Him and applying Him to our need.</P><P>We have the doctrine of the Lord being with our spirit, but we do not practice the reality. We all have to ask ourselves, "Do we really apply Christ in our daily life?" Most of the time we do not apply Him, because we are not used to it. We are used to applying ourselves. We are not used to applying this "foreign One." We have a "Foreigner" within us who came from afar, from the third heaven. One day when we said, "O Lord Jesus," He came into us as a "Stranger." He will never come out of us, yet we are not used to applying Him.</P><P>We may have heard messages about the human spirit, but we do not practice what we have heard, because we are not used to it. After we installed electricity in our home, it took us a long time to get used to it. We had to get used to going to the switch to turn on the light instead of going to light the oil lamp. I desire to see many saints in the church life all get used to "going to the switch" to "turn on Christ."</P><P>But to practice this requires a full understanding, a full realization, that God's desire is not for us to be moral or immoral, good or bad. He wants us to live by Him and with Him. He wants us to be persons who are full of life. This kind of fellowship may offend people who have been constituted with ethical and moral concepts. But we need to realize that the Scriptures reveal that mere ethics and morality are not what God desires.</P><P>In John 15:5b the Lord said, "Apart from Me you can do nothing." But we may love others, help others, and do many good things apart from Him. Christ did say that without Him we can do nothing, but actually we do many things without Him. Christ could say to us, "Apart from Me you can do so many things, but nothing you do apart from Me will be recognized by My Father. Whatever you do apart from Me will be burned. My Father will never accept it. Only one category of things that you do will be accepted by My Father. That is the category of things which you do with Me and in Me. What you do with Me and in Me will be recorded in the heavens and will go to My Father's account."</P><P>When we contact others with and in Christ, we will minister Christ into them. Apart from Jesus Christ, it is impossible for us to minister Christ into others. We may be able to do many things apart from Christ, but these things will not be recorded in the heavenly account. From the point of view of the heavenly account, whatever we do apart from Christ means nothing. Apart from Christ, we can do nothing that will be recognized by the heavenly Father. So the Christian life is not a matter of being ethical or moral. If it were, the Chinese would not need to become Christians. They were taught by Confucius, so they know how to be ethical. We do not need ethical teachings. We need Christ as our life.</P><P>The trouble with us is this. We may know that we need Christ as our life in theory and in doctrine, but in our daily life, in our practice, we forget about this. Those from the East would forget about Christ in their practical life because they have been influenced by the teachings of Confucius. Those in the West would forget about Christ because they have been influenced by ethical and moral concepts. We have been taught to be moral, to behave ourselves, and to build up a good character for ourselves. We were taught in this way, raised up in this kind of atmosphere, and are under this influence.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FLESH FORCING US TO TURN TO THE SPIRIT</H2><P>Before we were saved, we were careless. Now that we have been saved, we might tell the Lord, "Lord, thank You that You have saved me. O Lord, pardon me for all my carelessness in the past. Now I am Your child, heavenly Father. Help me to build up a good character so that I can glorify You in my parents' eyes and in the eyes of all my relatives. Help me, Lord." We may pray, "Lord, help me not to lose my temper, not to put You to shame. Help me to be a good brother in the church life." Many of us have prayed in this way because we are under the influence of the teaching of morality, of good behavior, and of building up a good character. Humanly speaking, there is nothing wrong with this, but this is not what God wants. God wants Christ to get into you.</P><P>We may have asked the Lord to help us to be a good person, to be a person who does not lose his temper and is not offended by anyone. After such a prayer, however, we became worse. Before we got saved, we may have lost our temper once a week. After we got saved and prayed in this way, we lost our temper three times a week. Then we wonder why it seems that we have become worse since we were saved. Actually, we are not "worse enough." We need to be exposed by being worse and worse. I experienced this. The more I prayed to become better, the worse I became. Eventually, I asked the Lord why He would not take this ugly flesh away from me. The Lord showed me that I needed it. Without such a troubling thing, that is, the flesh, none of us would go to the Lord.</P><P>We may want to be like Adam before the fall in the garden. Adam was good before the fall; he was innocent and pure. But there was a void, an emptiness, within him that gave the way for the enemy, the devil, to come in. Even if you were innocent and pure like Adam was before the fall, that could not last long. The devil would still come in to fill you up and possess you. We have the flesh with us today as a real trouble, but praise the Lord, this trouble is helpful. I was never so much with the Lord until I experienced this trouble. I prayed again and again that I could overcome this ugly flesh. Eventually, I found out that the ugly flesh is hopeless. Then the Lord showed me that He had no intention to deal with this ugly thing. Rather, He would leave it here, not for our bad temper, but for us to be forced to turn ourselves to the spirit.</P><P>For many years I have been alert and aware that day and night this ugly thing is here. When I am talking to the brothers, my wife, or my children, I realize that I am walking on thin ice. I have no confidence that I will be altogether victorious, because of the fact that this ugly thing is always with me. Since this ugly thing is always with me, I always have to be on the alert to turn to the Lord. While I am talking to the brothers, my wife, or my children, I need to pray inwardly, "O Lord, preserve me. O Lord, keep me in the spirit. Save me." This is because this ugly thing, the flesh, is so close to me. It is as if we are "one-eighth of an inch" away from being in the flesh at all times. If I am not alert that I have to be in the spirit, after two minutes I will be in the flesh. Then I will offend everyone.</P><P>Eventually, though, it is not a matter of offending or not offending someone. It is a matter of gaining more of Christ. I gain more of Christ because I have been turning to Him in my spirit all the time. It is not a matter of victory. It is a matter of gaining Christ. God's intention is to work Christ into us day and night. But we all need a helper to help us to turn to Him. Who is the helper? The most subjective and closest helper is our ugly flesh. Many of us do not realize that we have such an ugly helper.</P><P>I am burdened to tell you that within your spirit there is the real help. Within your spirit, there is the source of life. Within your spirit, there is the reality of life. The only problem is that you have been saved for so many years, yet you are still not used to turning to your spirit. So under God's sovereign wisdom this ugly flesh is left here for the purpose of forcing you to turn to Christ all the day.</P><P>If we would open ourselves to the Lord's enlightening and practice this, in the coming years we will gain more of Christ. Eventually, when we are transfigured in this ugly body, we can tell Satan good-bye. Without his bothering us in our flesh through all the years, we could not have gained so much of Christ. This shows that even Satan is used by God to fulfill His purpose. If we had never fallen that much, we would never appreciate the Lord's salvation so much.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR HUMAN SPIRIT</H2><P>Now let us consider the importance of our spirit. Zechariah 12:1 says that God stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him. In the whole universe only three things are crucial besides God: the heavens, the earth, and the human spirit. This is because the heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man has a spirit for God. Job 32:8 says, "There is a spirit in man." We have a spirit within us as an organ to contact God and take God in.</P><P>Proverbs 20:27 says that the spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord. This lamp needs the oil. Our spirit is God's lamp, and God is the oil for this lamp. John 4:24 says that God is Spirit and those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit. If you are going to contact God, to worship God, you need to worship Him in your spirit.</P><P>John 3:6 says, "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit." After being born again, our human spirit is no longer merely a human spirit, because it has the Lord Jesus and the Holy Spirit in it. The Spirit witnesses with our spirit (Rom. 8:16). This means the Holy Spirit is with our human spirit. Our spirit also has grace within it (Gal. 6:18). The flesh has sin, death, and Satan in it. But our spirit has Christ, the Spirit, and grace in it. Our flesh is a compound, compounded with sin, death, and Satan. Our spirit today is also a compound, compounded with Christ, the Spirit, and grace.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TWO ORGANS AND THREE PERSONS</H2><P>Man has two organs: the body as an outward organ and the spirit as an inward organ. In between these two organs is our being, that is, the human soul (1 Thes. 5:23). Our soul is our self, our being. The body is the outward organ for us to contact the material things. Our spirit is the inward organ for us to contact God. Through the fall, the devil, Satan, came into the outward organ, the human body. But in our regeneration, the Lord Jesus came into our inward organ, our human spirit.</P><P>We also need to realize that as Christians, we have three persons. The first person is yourself in your soul, your being. The second person is Satan in your flesh. And the third person is Christ in your spirit. This kind of truth has been fully missed today. Most of the teachings and sermons are in the ethical and moral realm, not in the realm that Paul taught in the book of Romans. In the book of Romans, there is not the ethical and moral concept, but the concept that our spirit today has Jesus Christ, the Spirit, and the very grace of God within it. God does not want us to be merely ethical and moral, but God surely wants us to walk according to this wonderful compound spirit. God wants us to live in this compound spirit and have our being every minute according to this compound spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MAN BETWEEN THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE<br>AND THE TREE OF LIFE</H2><P>The Bible is thoroughly consistent. It starts with a man in front of two trees, the tree of knowledge and the tree of life (Gen. 2:9). Eventually, in Romans we see that the tree of knowledge got into man's flesh, and the tree of life got into man's spirit. The two trees are within us Christians. The problem today is not whether you behave yourself ethically. The problem is whether you go to the tree of knowledge or come to the tree of life. Day by day do you live, walk, and have your being according to the flesh or according to the spirit? If you do things according to the flesh, that means you are eating the tree of knowledge. To set your mind upon the flesh is death (Rom. 8:6a). Death is the issue, the result, of eating the tree of knowledge. But if you walk according to the spirit, you touch the tree of life. To set your mind upon the spirit is life (v. 6b), and life is always the issue, the result, of eating the tree of life.</P><P>We need to see that these two trees are within us. We are not in front of the two trees but in between them. Outwardly, we have the tree of knowledge in our flesh. Inwardly, we have the tree of life in our spirit. Now the whole situation depends upon whether we would go to the tree of knowledge or turn to the tree of life. Would we walk, work, and have the church life according to the flesh or according to the spirit? If we have the church life according to the flesh, the result will be death. Then our church life will kill the saints because it is not according to the spirit but according to the flesh.</P><P>My burden is that we would see that Satan is in our flesh and Christ is in our spirit. We have an enemy in our flesh and a dear Savior in our spirit. What shall we do? Would we turn to our enemy and go along with him? Would we coordinate with him or come to Christ and be one with Him? We may say, "Surely, I will not go along with Satan but go along with Christ." I know you would say this, but this is easy to say. Actually, we need a lot of defeats and failures which will force us to realize that there is no hope in the flesh. The flesh is good only to force you to turn to Christ in your spirit.</P><P>Some older saints may tell the young people that they need to learn the lesson of patience. But actually the young saints do not need the lesson of patience. They need the lesson of failures. They need the lesson of losing their temper. This will make them desperate to turn to the Lord in their spirit. If the older saints teach the younger ones to learn the lesson of patience, none of them will ever make it. No one can graduate from this kind of school. But after two years, many of the young ones will graduate from the school of failures. Some would say, "I give up. I can never make it in the brothers' house. I don't have that much patience." I would say, "Hallelujah for your giving up." You have to give up and turn to the Lord in your spirit.</P><P>Our marriage life is also used by the Lord. God's purpose is to use your marriage life to force you to turn to your spirit. Without our spouse and our children, we could not gain Christ so much. The wives help the husbands to turn to Christ, and the husbands help the wives to turn to Christ. Praise the Lord for the hardship. Praise the Lord for the defeats, the failures. Praise the Lord for the many times we were trying to give up. Praise the Lord for the disappointments. This is because without all these negative things, we would never be forced to turn to the spirit. We would never be alert that we need Christ. We need Christ minute after minute. We need to come back again and again to the spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</H2><P>This is why Paul comes to the conclusion that we need to walk according to the spirit (Rom. 8:4). To walk is to have our being and our living with all that we say and do. Our living and our being with all that we say and do must be according to the spirit. We have to walk according to the spirit, according to the One who lives in us. This is the Christian walk. We have no more liberty. The Christian walk is not a matter of right or wrong and of loving or hating. It is a matter of walking according to the spirit. Only this life, this kind of walk, can be recorded in the heavens. Nothing else counts in the heavenly account. This is why the Lord said, "Apart from Me you can do nothing." What we do apart from Christ can never be recorded in the heavenly account. All the good things we do apart from Christ, regardless of how good they would be, are not a help to the church life.</P><P>The walk according to the spirit is for the church life. Only the persons who walk according to the spirit can be the proper members for the building up of a local church. If we do not have such a walk, sooner or later we will be a trouble to our local church. You may say, "I am for the church; I love the church so much." But you have to walk according to the spirit. If you do not walk according to the spirit, either you will go away or you will be a trouble in the church. No other life can build up the church life, but the life that walks according to the spirit. This walk saves us from all kinds of bugs, germs, troubles, dissensions, opinions, and concepts. This walk according to the spirit saves us to the uttermost, making us a profit to the building up of the church, not a trouble. There is only one life with one walk which fits in the building up of the local church. That life is Christ with the walk according to Him.</P><P>No doubt, we have an enemy in our flesh, but we do not need to fight against him. We have the Lord within us. We do not need to strive to fight against the enemy; nor do we need to strive to serve the Lord. We should do only one thing. Paul tells us clearly that this one thing is to walk according to the spirit. If we walk according to the spirit, the enemy can do nothing. The enemy is right in your flesh, so close to you, yet he can do nothing to touch you, because you are walking according to the spirit. This walking, spontaneously, is your worshipping, your serving, and your working for the Lord. The Christian life plus the church life is a life of walking according to the spirit. We have the flesh and in addition to this we have such a wonderful human spirit. Today our human spirit is regenerated, indwelt by Christ, by the Holy Spirit, and by God's grace. We have such a wonderful human spirit for our application.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THREE MAJOR ASPECTS OF CHRIST<br>IN ROMANS EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Rom. 8:3, 9-10, 34; John 1:14; 14:16-17; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17; Heb. 2:14; Eph. 2:15, 22</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST CONDEMNING SIN IN THE FLESH</H2><P>Romans 8:3 says, "For that which the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh." This verse shows that Christ died on the cross to condemn sin. We should not think that it is good enough just to be redeemed from sin. This sin also has to be put to death.</P><P>Sin is personified. It has some living element in it. Sin is the embodiment of Satan. The embodiment of God is Christ. Satan imitated God to have an embodiment, and Satan's embodiment is called sin in the Bible. Thus, in Romans 7 sin is a person. Sin, the embodiment of Satan, dwells in us, kills us, defeats us, and lords it over us. In Romans 8 Christ came in the likeness of the flesh of sin for the purpose of condemning sin. Sin is a robber. Surely God has to condemn this robbing one. Sin is a living person, the very person of the evil one.</P><P>Satan got into man's flesh. He was clever, but God is more clever than he is. God could have said, "Satan, you got into the body I created for man and took possession of it. You have been enjoying it as your dwelling place, but now it has become your trap." We may use a mousetrap as an illustration of this. The mouse might have thought he was clever to get the bait, but eventually he became trapped and could not run away. Our flesh was used by God as a trap for Satan. Satan was like a mouse running freely in this universe. One day, however, he became trapped in the flesh.</P><P>After he was trapped in the flesh, the Son of God became flesh. We may say that the Word became a man and that God was manifested in a man, but the Bible does not say it in this way. John 1:14 says that the Word became flesh, and 1 Timothy 3:16 says that God was manifested in the flesh. Satan took the flesh as his dwelling place, but the Lord came and brought this dwelling place, the flesh, to the cross. God condemned the personified sin by becoming flesh and carrying the flesh to the cross.</P><P>By His death on the cross, Christ destroyed the devil (Heb. 2:14). Satan stirred up the Jewish people and the Roman soldiers to put Jesus on the cross, but when he did this, he was helping to nail his dwelling place, the flesh, on the cross. He did not realize that by doing this, he was helping the Lord to put him to death. Satan was in the flesh, and Christ crucified this flesh on the cross to destroy the devil.</P><P>Although the Bible says that Christ became flesh, we need to realize that according to the Bible, He was only in the likeness of the flesh of sin (Rom. 8:3), and He did not have the sin of the flesh (2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 4:15). John 3:14 tells us that Christ was lifted up on the cross as a serpent, not a serpent of poison but a serpent of brass. The brass serpent surely had the same form as the serpent of poison, but it did not have the poison. Christ was in the likeness of the serpent, the likeness of the flesh of sin. The Bible tells us that when He was crucified there, we were also crucified with Him (Gal. 2:20a). We also need to realize that even Satan was crucified on the cross with Him. When Christ was hanging on the cross, in the eyes of God, He was not only in the form of man but also in the form of a serpent. The serpent and man had become one, so to be in the form of man is to be in the form of the serpent.</P><P>We need to realize that all of us are little serpents. Many times the husbands and wives appear as serpents to each other. The Lord rebuked the Pharisees by calling them serpents and a brood of vipers (Matt. 23:33). The Lord Jesus not only died on the cross instead of us to redeem us. He also died there with us. When He died there with us, He died there with Satan. He died on the cross with the human nature, and in this way He destroyed the devil. We all have to praise God for His sovereign wisdom. Satan thought he received the profit by entering into man's flesh, but he did not know that he put himself into a trap. One day the Son of God came to be that trap in form and He brought this trap to the cross.</P><P>No human word is adequate to fully explain this. It is too great and too mysterious. But the Bible does speak of this in Romans 8:3, John 3:14, and Hebrews 2:14. In the flesh, Christ dealt with the flesh. In the flesh, Christ dealt with sin. In the flesh, Christ dealt with Satan. Judicially speaking, in God's governmental administration, the flesh with sin, with death, and with Satan has been fully crushed.</P><P>You may ask me why this flesh still remains with us when it has been dealt with and crushed. This is because it still has some usage for God. Judicially speaking, it is over, but practically speaking, it is still needed. It is not needed for God, but needed for you to force you to turn to your spirit. God is sitting on the throne judicially, and the troublesome flesh of His chosen people has been dealt with judicially. In His government there is not such a thing. But practically, all His children, while they are still on this earth, need this troublesome flesh to help them to turn to Christ.</P><P>There is no such thing as good flesh. Just as there is not good dung and bad dung, there is not good flesh and bad flesh. Flesh is just flesh. When we are bothered by the flesh and forced to turn to the spirit, God is happy with us. You may have thought that after you believed in Christ, everything would be wonderful. But after a period of time, you may have become the most miserable person. You may even wish that you had never become a Christian. You may want to forsake Christ. But thank the Lord that once you get caught by the Lord, you are caught forever. In one sense, to be a Christian is a joyful thing, but in another sense, we are not very happy. What shall we do? Whether we are happy or not, we are here.</P><P>In the meetings we may be really happy, but are we happy when we get back home in our daily life? To be in a conference is like being on the mountaintop with the Lord Jesus, but to go back home is to go back to the valley. When we come to the meetings, we are coming up, but when we go back home after the meetings, we are going down. What should we do? We should not be disappointed. We need a proper realization of the Christian life. We should not dream that everything is wonderful in the Christian life. My burden is to wake you up from this dream. Do not dream anymore. We have to realize that while we are still on this earth, we need the help of the flesh to force us to turn to Christ in our spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST IN US</H2><P>Christ died on the cross to deal with the flesh and condemn sin. In one sense, He was put into death. In another sense, He walked into death. He took a tour by traveling through death, but death could not hold Him. He walked out of death and walked into resurrection. In one sense, He was resurrected. In another sense, He resurrected Himself because He is life. In resurrection, He was transfigured into another form. He was transfigured from the form of flesh to the form of the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17).</P><P>Romans 8:3 says that He came in the likeness of the flesh of sin. But today according to verse 10 He is no longer in the flesh. Verse 10 says that Christ is in us! When He was in the form of the flesh, He was on the cross, but today He is within us. He is not in the form of the flesh anymore, but He is the life-giving Spirit.</P><P>He was in the flesh for thirty-three and a half years. John 1:14 tells us the Word became flesh. While He was in the flesh, He was the Lamb of God (v. 29). In John 14 He told the disciples that He was going to be another Comforter. He was a Comforter in the flesh, and He was going to be another One as the Spirit (vv. 16-17). Then He said, "I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you. Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you also shall live. In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you" (vv. 18-20). This word has been fulfilled in Romans 8:10, which says that Christ is now in us. Our Christ today is no longer on the cross. He is in us. On the cross He was in the flesh. In us He is the Spirit. He is now in our spirit. He condemned and dealt with our flesh. He has also come into our spirit to transform it with glory and to make our spirit the most wonderful thing in this universe. Christ dwells today in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22).</P><P>Hebrews 2:14 says that He destroyed Satan through His death. Ephesians 2:15 says that in His flesh on the cross, He abolished, destroyed, the law of the commandments in ordinances. In the flesh on the cross, Christ did a destroying, abolishing, annulling, and killing work. In our spirit, His work is absolutely different. It is a building up, raising up, and strengthening work to make our spirit the most wonderful place in the whole universe. Ephesians 2:15 speaks of His abolishing work on the cross in the flesh, whereas verse 22 says that our spirit is now God's habitation. We are being built into a habitation of God in our spirit. Now something positive is being built. This is the building up of God's habitation in our spirit.</P><P>We all have to see that judicially the flesh is over because it was dealt with by Christ on the cross, but it still remains with us because of our Father's wisdom. Whether we are happy or unhappy, the flesh helps us to turn to Christ in the spirit and have no more confidence in the flesh. In this sense, we can be thankful for the flesh. But we are also disgusted with and afraid of the flesh. We would be alert all the time to turn to our spirit. The Lord does not care for whether or not we have a victory. The Lord cares for only one thing&#151;that we gain Christ. Because we are afraid of the flesh, we turn to our spirit and gain Christ.</P><P>At the end of our spiritual journey, the Lord will not say, "Child, you were so good. You have gained many victories." Jacob lived over a hundred years, but how many victories did he get? It is hard for us to find a victory in his life. He had many defeats. He was subtle, striving, and supplanting. He was a heel holder. But in all his defeats and striving, Jacob gained more of God. Eventually, he was transformed, so his name was changed from Jacob, the supplanter, to Israel, the prince of God.</P><P>God does not care for victory. Do not listen to the teachings of Christianity which say that you have to be a victor. Whether you will be a victor or not, I do not know, but I do know that the Lord wants you to gain Him more. The Lord's goal is not to let you have the victory. His goal is that Christ may be gained by you and that Christ be more and more wrought into you.</P><P>Through all the defeats, through all the failures, through all the bad experiences with your wife, husband, children, and the dear saints around you, day by day you are gradually gaining more of Christ. You may expect to have wonderful elders in the church, but instead they may disappoint you. But the more you are disappointed with the elders, the more you are helped to turn to the spirit. Do not look at the elders. Look at Christ in your spirit. Do not turn to the elders. Turn to your spirit and gain more of Christ. The wives should not consider what kind of husbands they have nor should the husbands consider what kind of wives they have. Instead, we all need to turn to the spirit and gain Christ. This is all that God cares for. On the one hand, we are happy because our flesh has been crushed. On the other hand, we are unhappy because the flesh will remain with us until the day of our maturity. When we are fully matured, we can say good-bye to the flesh and thank it for its help.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST INTERCEDING FOR US</H2><P>We must see that Christ became two things. First, He became flesh. Second, He became the Spirit. He became the flesh to crush the flesh and to condemn sin in the flesh, and He became the Spirit to indwell us and become our life. Romans also reveals that Christ is the One who is interceding in the third heaven. Romans 8:34 says, "It is Christ Jesus who died and, rather, who was raised, who is also at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us." He became flesh to condemn sin in the flesh. As the One who is now here indwelling us and giving life to us, He is the life-giving Spirit. As the One who is interceding for us, pleading for us in the heavenly court, He is in the third heaven. These are the three major points concerning Christ in Romans 8.</P><P>In verse 3 of chapter eight, He was on the cross. In verse 10 He is now in us. In verse 34 while He is here imparting life, He is in the third heaven interceding. We need Him to become flesh; we need Him to be the Spirit; and we need Him interceding for us. We have an all-inclusive Christ. He crushed our flesh and condemned sin in our flesh. He became the Spirit to impart Himself as life to us, to indwell our spirit, and to strengthen our spirit. Also, for fulfilling God's economy, He needs to pray for us. He is now interceding for us in the heavenly administrative office as the very Paraclete (1 John 2:1; Heb. 7:25).</P><P>Christ went to the cross, and we went with Him. He came out of the tomb in resurrection, and so did we. He is now in resurrection, and so are we (Eph. 2:6). Today He is in our spirit, and we are walking according to the spirit (Rom. 8:4). While we are walking according to the spirit, He is interceding for us at the right hand of God. The bountiful issue of this is that we will get the help from the flesh but not be bothered by the flesh. We will be absolutely in the spirit.</P><P>When we are in our spirit, we are in the heavens. Jacob had a dream in which he saw a ladder set up on earth, the top of which reached to heaven. The angels of God were ascending and descending on this ladder (Gen. 28:12). When he woke up, he said, "This is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven" (v. 17). He called the name of that place Bethel, which means the house of God (v. 19). According to Ephesians 2:22, our spirit today is the real Bethel, the house of God. Our spirit is also the gate of heaven. When we turn to our spirit, we are in the third heaven.</P><P>Hebrews tells us that we have to come forward to the throne of grace (4:16) and enter into the Holy of Holies (10:22). The throne of grace and the Holy of Holies are in heaven. How can we enter into heaven? We just need to get into our spirit; then we are in heaven because our spirit is the gate of heaven, the entry of heaven. When you get into the spirit, you are in the Holy of Holies.</P><P>We can use electricity as an illustration of this. The power plant is far away from the electrical lights in a building, yet these lights are one with the power plant when they are turned on. In a sense, they are in the power plant because they are experiencing the electricity at the power plant. Apparently, we are here on this earth. But actually, we are all in heaven when we turn ourselves to the spirit.</P><P>We do not have two Christs&#151;one in our spirit and the other in the third heaven. The One sitting at the right hand of God in the third heaven is the very One in our spirit. The same electricity can be simultaneously in the power plant and in a distant building. In the same way, Christ is in the third heaven interceding for us, and He is also in our spirit. While He is interceding for us, He is talking with us. Many times while we are speaking, He is speaking in our speaking. We are being built into the habitation of God in spirit. Our spirit is the gate of heaven.</P><P>May the Lord open our eyes to see this. We do not need any admonishing or exhorting to be good. We need the message from Romans 7 and 8 to see how ugly our flesh is. There is nothing good in our flesh, yet it is still here to help us turn to Christ in our spirit. Christ in the likeness of the flesh of sin crushed the sinful flesh. In resurrection He was transfigured into the Spirit. He has come into us and is indwelling our spirit to impart life to us. He is strengthening, supporting, and sustaining us to live a heavenly life on earth. At the same time, He is in the third heaven interceding for us.</P><P>After listening to this fellowship, do not make up your mind to do anything. This never works. You have to see the vision concerning the flesh. You have to see a clear view of Christ as the Spirit in your spirit. Do not pray, "From now on I will make up my mind. I will never walk according to the flesh. I will never lose my temper. I will never be a shame in the eyes of my wife." That is a satanic prayer in the realm of the tree of good and evil. That is not a prayer by Christ interceding for us. We simply need to turn to the Lord in our spirit. Then He will become more and more real to us. Then we can tell the Lord, "You are my world. You are my kingdom. You are my sphere. You are my realm. Hallelujah, Lord Jesus! You are everything to me." Then the Lord will be happy, and He will become more to you in your experience for the fulfillment of His economy.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A STRONG SPIRIT FOR GOD'S HABITATION</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Tim. 4:22a; 1 Cor. 6:17; Rom. 8:4, 9-10; Gal. 5:25; Eph. 2:22; 1 Cor. 5:3; Rev. 1:10, 12; John 4:24; Deut. 12:5-7, 13-14</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD RESERVING THE HUMAN SPIRIT FOR HIS PURPOSE</H2><P>The flesh and the spirit are the real keys to our spiritual life and church life. If we mean business with the Lord for the Christian life and the church life, we have to see the flesh and the spirit. We need to realize that our flesh has been thoroughly polluted and corrupted by Satan's presence. Regardless of how good we may be, our flesh is corrupted with Satan. But thank God that with all the fallen human beings, God has reserved the human spirit for His purpose.</P><P>It is as if God has drawn a borderline to encircle the human spirit and protect it from the corruption of the devil. This principle can be fully illustrated by the case of Job. God let Satan damage Job, but He told Satan that there was a line. Satan was allowed to go only so far. God would not let him go any further (Job 2:4-6). I believe that God did the same thing with Satan concerning the human race. God allowed Satan to damage the human race, but He allowed him to go only so far. Satan got into the human body and damaged the human soul, but God preserved the human spirit for Himself.</P><P>If we consider our past before we were saved, we can realize that although our flesh was so bad, deep within us there was another part preserved by God. When people are acting in the lusts of the flesh, something deep within them is saying, "You shouldn't do this. This is not right." This is the voice out of the section of their being preserved by God.</P><P>Today, with us, the saved ones, the principle is even more clear. The lusts in your flesh may urge you to go to the movies or to the department store. While you are being urged to go, there is another section of your being deep within you telling you not to go. Deep within the Lord may say, "Do you really mean that you love Me? Don't you remember the meeting in which you stood up and told people you consecrate yourself to Christ and the church?" We do have the ugly flesh, but we also have a wonderful spirit. One part, our flesh, is fully possessed by Satan. The other part, our spirit, is kept by the Lord and for the Lord.</P><P>We must have a thorough discernment of what the flesh is and what the spirit is. A brother's wife may prepare a meal for him which is not so good. This offends him. Strictly speaking, this offended his flesh. When you are offended in your flesh, you will immediately react. But the inner part of this brother's being would say Hallelujah to his dear wife. There is a struggle between the flesh and the spirit (Gal. 5:16-17). If a brother sides with the lust in his flesh, he will argue with his wife. If he remains in his spirit, he will say, "Praise the Lord! Jesus is Lord, even if my meal is not so good."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TWO STEPS OF CHRIST</H2><P>We must also see that Christ as the Son of God, even as God Himself, has taken two steps. We all have to say, "Hallelujah for the two steps which Christ has taken!" First, He took a step to become a man (John 1:14). He did not become a man who was outwardly splendid and attractive. He became what we are. We are flesh, and He became flesh. The flesh is ugly. In a sense, Christ became something ugly, not in actuality but in form, in likeness. Christ's nature, His substance, is marvelous. It is not ugly. But the appearance of Christ while He was in the flesh was ugly. The Bible says that He did not have any form or outward comeliness and that He had no outward beauty (Isa. 53:2; 52:14). Nothing with Him was outwardly attractive.</P><P>He was in that form for the purpose of bringing our ugly flesh to the cross. He became flesh to crush the flesh and to destroy Satan in the flesh. Judicially speaking, both Satan and our flesh have been condemned once for all. But God allowed the flesh to remain with us to help us and force us to turn to Christ in our spirit. Christ took the first step to become the flesh in order to crush the flesh.</P><P>After this He took a further step. The last Adam, who was in the flesh, resurrected and became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). A number of Christians oppose this truth. They say that Christ is only the Son in the Triune God. But the Bible in 1 Corinthians 15:45b tells us definitely, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit." Also 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, "And the Lord is the Spirit." If Christ were not the Spirit, He could not be in us. Even according to our experience, the Christ who is within us is the Spirit. The pure Word tells us that our Christ today is not merely the Lamb of God. Today He is the life-giving Spirit. Before the process of His death and resurrection, He was the Lamb of God, and today in the heavens, He still is the Lamb of God. But through the process of His death and resurrection, He is something more. Our Christ is all-inclusive. He is the life-giving Spirit. Now the Lord is the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</H2><P>He is the Spirit so that He can be with us in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22a; Rom. 8:16). The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit (Gal. 6:18). He became flesh to crush our flesh. Then He took another step to become the Spirit in order to be with our spirit. First Corinthians 6:17 says, "He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit." Thank the Lord for our being one spirit with the Lord. This one spirit is a compound spirit, a mingled spirit. It is the divine Spirit mingled with the human spirit.</P><P>In verses like Romans 8:4, 9-10, and Galatians 5:25, it is difficult for the translators to make a decision as to whether the spirit mentioned in these verses is the Holy Spirit or the human spirit. It is hard because it is the mingled spirit, the Holy Spirit mingled with the human spirit. We need to walk according to the spirit, that is, the mingled spirit. By this one mingled spirit, we enjoy two spirits. We enjoy the Holy Spirit in our spirit, and we enjoy our spirit with the Holy Spirit. Today we need to take care of one thing&#151;walking according to the spirit.</P><P>We have many questions concerning how we should be and what we should do as Christians. Someone may ask, "Should I go to the movies?" Others may wonder what kind of clothes they should wear. Other Christian brothers may consider how long their hair should be. First Corinthians 11 says that it is a shame for a man to have long hair (v. 14). But how long is long? No one can make a decision concerning this. Please do not come to me asking these questions. We have One within us whose name is Counselor (Isa. 9:6). Go to Him and check with Him. Then you will have the answer.</P><P>Once a sister asked me how she should deal with her husband. I told her that she did not need to come to me, because she had already received the answer. She asked me what I meant. I told her, "The Lord Jesus was with you last night, and He said something to you. He already told you that you shouldn't talk to your dear husband in that way." No one told me her story, but I saw the "heavenly television" concerning this sister's situation. After I told her this, she admitted that the Lord had spoken to her in this way. I told her to take care of what the Lord had told her. I said, "The Lord Jesus is within you, and you have His speaking. Now walk according to the spirit." If we walk according to the spirit, there will be no problems.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST STRENGTHENING OUR SPIRIT<br>FOR THE BUILDING UP OF GOD'S HABITATION</H2><P>We have to realize that our flesh has been crushed, and our spirit has been not only regenerated but also strengthened. Our spirit is indwelt by the life-giving Spirit. We have such a wonderful, strengthened, mingled spirit within us, and this spirit must be the strongest part of our whole being. Do not have a strong mind, will, or emotion. The sisters should not let their emotions be the strongest part of their being. We have Jesus! We do not need to weep with many tears. Sometimes the tears of the sisters are for the purpose of gaining sympathy from others. The Old Testament tells us that two sons of Aaron were condemned and killed by the holiness of God. Moses then told Aaron not to weep for his sons (Lev. 10:1-3, 6). This means that the priests should control their natural affection, not sympathizing with the victim condemned by God's holiness. Furthermore, God's shekinah glory was there. There should be no tears in the presence of this shekinah glory. We should not have strong emotions. We have a strong spirit. Paul said that we have a spirit of power (2 Tim. 1:7), a strong spirit, strengthened by the divine Spirit. I want to stress this point to the uttermost&#151;we have the strongest spirit, a spirit of power!</P><P>Those who go along with their spirit may seem to be somewhat crazy, but the proper Christians are crazy people. I do not mean that we are mental cases. What I mean is that we are the crazy lovers of Christ! The lovers of Christ are those who walk according to the spirit. In the book of Revelation, the apostle John said, "I was in spirit on the Lord's Day...and I turned to see the voice that spoke with me; and when I turned, I saw seven golden lampstands" (1:10, 12). John was in his mingled spirit, heard the voice in his spirit, and had a turn in his spirit to see the seven golden lampstands. If you are bothered with certain church matters, do not stay in your mind to figure out things according to your knowledge and to argue about them. Forget about your mentality and turn to your spirit. When you turn to your spirit, the veil will be gone and you will see the churches as the golden lampstands.</P><P>Christ became flesh to crush the flesh, and He became the Spirit to impart life into us and to strengthen our spirit, not merely for our salvation, but for the building up of God's habitation. God desires to have a resting place. In Isaiah 66:1 God said that heaven is His throne and the earth is His footstool, but He is looking for a resting place. His resting place, His habitation, is composed of human beings who have been regenerated, transformed, and built together. God is looking for this, and Christ is God's anointed One to accomplish this.</P><P>He became flesh and crushed the flesh on the cross. Then He became the Spirit and now is strengthening our spirit for the purpose of building up His habitation. In Ephesians 2:22 Paul said, "In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit." We can say that our spirit is the dwelling place of God. But strictly speaking, Ephesians 2:22 shows that our spirit is the place where the habitation of God is. The habitation of God is the Body, the built-up church. This habitation is in our spirit. There is only one place where we can be one. That place is in our spirit. If we get out of our spirit and stay in our mind, we will argue with one another. We should turn to our spirit.</P><P>When you are about to exchange words with your husband or with your wife, you should turn to your spirit. Once you turn to your spirit, your excuses will be terminated. Sometimes we may have the thought to argue with the brothers, but the life-giving Spirit will send a "cable" to our mind, telling our mind to come back to the spirit. The indwelling Christ tells us to turn to our spirit. Our exercising to turn to our spirit causes us to grow in life.</P><P>Certain ones have come to us to argue against the truth concerning the ground of the church or concerning the Lord's recovery. Sometimes I would say, "In your mind you are arguing with me, but in your spirit you say Amen to me." Let us come into the spirit. When we come into the spirit, right away we are one. Christianity is divided because most Christians abide in their mind. The mind is really divisive, but in the spirit is unity. Christians have argued over the method of baptism. There is baptism by immersion, by sprinkling, in fresh water, in salt water, in the river, in the baptistery, and in the bathtub. There is baptism in the name of Jesus and in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Some have even said that we need to follow Jesus to be baptized in the Jordan River, where He was baptized. We need to forget about all these kinds of doctrinal differences and come back to the spirit. Doctrines can be a snare, a trap. We have to jump out of this trap. We are those who have been saved by the blood and regenerated in our spirit. Let us come back to our spirit where we are one.</P><P>In Deuteronomy 12&#151;16, the Lord charged the people of Israel again and again that when they entered into the good land, they had to worship God in the place which He would choose. They had no right to worship God with the enjoyment of all the offerings in the place of their choice. They had to go to the unique place chosen by God, where He would put His name and have His habitation. This place would be the center of their corporate worship to God. They could pray to God and fellowship with the Lord in their homes, but they had no right to have corporate worship in any place which they liked. They had to go to the unique place chosen by the Lord, which became Jerusalem.</P><P>In Jerusalem was God's temple, God's habitation, bearing God's glorious name. All the Israelites went there three times a year (Deut. 16:16), and that unique center kept the unity of all the twelve tribes. If they had the liberty to set up their own worship centers, they would have been divided. The tribe of Dan in the north would have said, "It is too far for us to go to the south to worship God in Jerusalem. Our God is omnipresent. If He is there in Jerusalem with you, surely He is here with us in Dan." Immediately there would have been a division. But in God's wisdom He charged them beforehand that they had no right to do this. They all had to go to the one place.</P><P>Even today, after so many centuries, no Jew on this earth dares to build a temple. They have the boldness to build hundreds of synagogues, but no one dares to build the temple, because they all know the charge in Deuteronomy. There is only one unique ground, one unique site, for them to build God's habitation. That is on Mount Zion in Jerusalem. That unique ground kept the unity of God's people.</P><P>What was there in the Old Testament is a type of the reality in the New Testament. John 4 tells the story of the Lord Jesus speaking with a Samaritan woman. Eventually she said, "Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, yet you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship" (v. 20). Then the Lord told her that the hour had come for the true worship of God (v. 21). That means the dispensation had changed. Men now would no longer worship God with the types but in reality. The Lord said, "But an hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truthfulness, for the Father also seeks such to worship Him" (v. 23). Jerusalem was the unique center of God's people's worship to God, but this was a type of the human spirit. We can be one only if we worship God in our spirit, which is today's Jerusalem. Today we have to worship God in spirit and in reality (v. 24). We do not need to go to Jerusalem to worship God with the offerings. Christ is now here as the reality of all the sacrifices, the offerings, and we can worship God in our spirit with Him as our reality.</P><P>If we do not worship God corporately in our spirit, we will be divided by our opinions and concepts. One Brethren assembly became divided over whether to use a piano or an organ in their meeting. Some may want to use guitars in the meeting, but others may not agree with this. Who is wrong and who is right? If we argue in this way, our arguments will be endless. We must be delivered from all these arguments. The place where we should be is not in our mentality. The place where we should be is in the spirit.</P><P>Some may not like the church meetings because they think they are too loud. But we need to turn to our spirit and see what the Lord would say. The Lord said in His Word that we need to make a joyful noise and even shout (Psa. 100:1; Isa. 12:6)! A voice is orderly, but a noise is not. Let us make a joyful noise and shout to the Lord! Hebrews 5:7 says concerning Christ, "This One, in the days of His flesh, having offered up both petitions and supplications with strong crying...." When we are under extreme pressure or in a very difficult environment, as the Lord was, we will pray with strong crying. If we do not make a joyful noise, shout, and cry out, we cannot be released to the uttermost. This kind of exercise will fill us with joy and rejoicing.</P><P>The main point is that we touch the Lord in our spirit. It is not a matter of how we worship, but a matter of whether or not we are released and touching the Lord in the spirit. We all have to come back to the spirit. When we come back to the spirit, we have the presence of the Lord, and we are one. In the spirit we are one, and in the spirit we offer Christ to God. It is in the spirit that we enjoy Christ with one another before God. We have the corporate worship in today's Jerusalem, our spirit, not with the offerings, but with Christ. In this way God's habitation is built up.</P><P>Today a number of Christians would say that they care for meeting in the Lord's name. But we also need to take care of the Lord's habitation. We must meet in a place where the name of the Lord is and where the habitation of God is. The habitation is the building. Where the name of the Lord is and where the building of the saints is, that is the right place for all of us to come together to worship the Lord. That place is our spirit. If we are in our spirit, we are one and we are being built up. The mind is the divisive field. We are not one with one another in the mind. We all have to stay in our spirit. Here is oneness. Here is unity. Here is peace. Here is the building of the Body. Here is the habitation of God. And here is the worship to God.</P><P>Christ became flesh to get rid of the flesh, and He became the Spirit to strengthen our spirit. This mingled spirit is the place where we should be built together and where we should worship God, not with what we have by ourselves, but with what Christ is to us. In our spirit we enjoy Him. This is the proper way to have the church life. Let us practice all the time to turn back to the spirit. Then we will have the proper church life. The human, regenerated, transformed, and indwelt spirit is our place for the building up of the Body, for the practicing of the church life, for the real worship to God, and for our fellowship with one another. As we remain in our spirit and turn to our spirit, spontaneously we will have a proper Christian life in our daily walk and a proper church life corporately. This is God's way.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>EATING JESUS FOR GROWTH AND BUILDING</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:8; Rom. 10:12; Col. 2:9; John 1:14, 16; 1 Cor. 3:2a, 7; Col. 2:19; Eph. 4:13</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST AS THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT<br>IN OUR SPIRIT FOR GOD'S BUILDING</H2><P>Christ today is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b) indwelling our spirit (Rom. 8:16). We have seen clearly that this is simply for the building. God's eternal plan is to get a living building, but Satan came into man, into man's flesh, trying to frustrate God. However, God is wiser than His enemy. He came in the likeness of the flesh to crush the flesh, and then in resurrection He became the Spirit. This is the crucial point. He became the Spirit to come into our spirit, and we are joined to Him as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). We may say that this was for life-imparting, for saving us, or for our enjoyment. But all of these points are for one ultimate point, that is, for us to be built up together. Christ's dealing with the flesh and being the life-giving Spirit in our spirit are for one goal, that is, for the building.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BUILDING BEING THE GROWTH IN LIFE</H2><P>In the New Testament, the concept of building is much different from our natural concept. Our natural concept concerning building is that one piece of material is placed upon another piece repeatedly, piece upon piece, until we have a high tower. But in the eyes of God, this is not building. This is a piling of material. Some may say that we Christians are people of togetherness, so they think building is just to get together. But togetherness is not building. If you sit together with me, and we talk to one another about our personal affairs, this is togetherness. Building is not just to get together, to be piled up. Building in the New Testament is growth in life. God's salvation is absolutely not a matter of doing, working, acting, or behaving. God's salvation consummates in one thing&#151;our growth in life. We all have to grow. The vine tree in John 15 is not a matter of doing, working, behaving, laboring, or striving. The vine tree is altogether a matter of growth. Growing is the real building.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GROWING IN LIFE BY EATING JESUS</H2><P>I have been a genuine, seeking Christian since 1925. I loved the Lord and the Bible so much, but for many years I never heard a message telling me that I have to grow in life. I heard message after message telling me that I had to do certain things or behave in a certain way. But no one told me that I need to grow, not to improve. No school can help you to grow. Every school is doing its best to help you to improve.</P><P>The main thing that good mothers do is to feed their children. In our homes the dining table is much more important than the desk. Every Lord's Day we do not have a desk in front of us but a dining table, that is, the Lord's table. I have traveled to many places and have been a guest in many homes. The first thing the host would care for is my eating. In many homes I did not have a desk, but in every home I had a dining table. This is because eating is more important than studying, writing, and reading.</P><P>If God had asked us to write the Bible, we would have written it in a different way. First Corinthians 11 tells us that in the night in which the Lord was betrayed, He took bread and said, "This is My body, which is given for you; this do unto the remembrance of Me" (v. 24). Then He took the cup and said, "This cup is the new covenant established in My blood; this do, as often as you drink it, unto the remembrance of Me" (v. 25). Why does the Lord tell us to remember Him in this way? One day the Lord opened my eyes to see what the real remembrance of Him is. The real remembrance of the Lord is not the outward form of giving a prayer, singing a hymn, praising Him, or kneeling down. The real remembrance of Him is to eat Him. The more that you eat Him, the more you remember Him. This is because the remembrance of the Lord is a declaration of the way we live. We live by eating and drinking Christ day by day.</P><P>The Bible is filled with the thought of eating. Immediately after God created man, He took care of man's eating. He did not charge Adam to love Eve, and He did not charge Eve to submit to Adam. He did not charge them or give them instructions about how to be good parents. After God created man, God only told him to be careful to eat the right tree. If you eat the right tree, you will have life. If you eat the wrong tree, you will die.</P><P>Later, in Exodus we see that the children of Israel kept the Passover (12:15-20). They were charged to strike the blood and eat the lamb. Then they entered into the wilderness where they ate manna for forty years (16:35). Those wanderers in the wilderness were an eating people. They had no jobs, no businesses, no stores, and no schools. Day after day they simply ate the heavenly manna. When they entered into the good land, they ate of its rich produce (Josh. 5:12).</P><P>In the New Testament time, the Lord Jesus came. People considered Him as a prophet, a great teacher, and some even wanted to make Him a king. When they tried to make Him a king, He withdrew from them (John 6:15). The next day He told the people that He was the bread of life (v. 35). He did not want to be their king, but He wanted to be eaten by them. In John 6:57 He said, "He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me." It was as if the Lord were saying, "Don't make Me your king. Take Me as your food."</P><P>In Luke 15 the Lord told the parable of a prodigal son returning home to his father. He decided to tell his father, "I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired servants" (vv. 18-19). He made up his mind to work for his father, but the father said to his slaves, "Bring out quickly the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet. And bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry" (vv. 22-23). This shows that when a fallen sinner repents, he always thinks of working for God or of serving God to obtain His favor, not knowing that this thought is against God's love and grace and is an insult to His heart and intent. God's desire is for us to eat the rich Christ typified by the fattened calf.</P><P>At the end of the Lord's life, He set up a table so that we can remember Him by eating and drinking Him. Then in the last book of the Bible, Revelation, the Lord Jesus promised the overcomers in the churches that He would give them to eat of the tree of life (2:7) and the hidden manna (v. 17). Even He said, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, then I will come in to him and dine with him and he with Me" (Rev. 3:20). Some use this to preach the gospel by saying that Jesus is standing at the door of your heart and if you receive Him, He will come into you. But we need to see that He comes into us so that we can feast with Him.</P><P>Eventually, the Bible concludes with a promise and a call. The promise says that all those who have washed their robes have the right to eat of the tree of life (Rev. 22:14). The call is from the Spirit and the bride for the thirsty sinner to come and take the water of life (v. 17). Thus, the Bible ends with a promise of eating and a call of drinking.</P><P>The Bible is a book of eating for growth. If there is no eating, there is no growth. A child becomes a man not because of his education but because of his growth. The building of the church, which is the growth in life, comes out of eating. This is the principle which has been fully missed by religious Christianity.</P><P>Christ crushed the flesh and now indwells our spirit so that we can eat Him. His indwelling us is for our eating. The outward table at the Lord's table meeting is a sign. We have a table within us. We see the outward symbol once a week, but the inward reality is with us every day. We all have a table within us. Our human spirit is the dining room and also the dining table. Christ is in our spirit always available for us to eat.</P><P>Now we need to consider what eating is. To eat is to take some nourishment into our organic being. The only way a chicken can become a part of us and become our nourishment is for us to eat it. To eat the chicken is to put it into our organic being. When we eat, digest, and assimilate it, the nourishing element gets into our organic tissue. Then this chicken becomes us. We are what we eat.</P><P>Day by day we eat Christ. Eventually, what we eat becomes us. By eating Christ we become Christ because we are constituted with Him. The Christian life is not a matter of endeavoring to behave ourselves in an ethical way. It is a matter of eating Christ. When we eat Christ, we take Him into us. We digest and assimilate Christ into our spiritual, organic tissue. Then Christ is wrought into us. This Christ wrought into us is the real building.</P><P>God does not care about what you do. He does not want you to do anything. He is capable of calling not being as being (Rom. 4:17). This was the way He took in His creation. He said "light," and light was there (Gen. 1:3). God does not need you to do anything. What God wants is to present Himself in His Son, Christ, as the riches for you to receive and enjoy. All the unsearchable riches of Christ are for our enjoyment (Eph. 3:8). The Lord is rich unto all who call upon His name (Rom. 10:12).</P><P>Romans 8 speaks of walking according to the spirit. Then chapter nine says that we are vessels (vv. 21, 23). A vessel is a container with a mouth. In Romans 10 the mouth is used to call, "O Lord Jesus!" Then all the riches get into the vessel. Romans 10 shows us that the empty vessels have a mouth to call on the name of the Lord in order to receive, to take in, all His riches.</P><P>Romans does not stop in chapter eight with walking according to the spirit. It continues in chapter nine by telling us that we are vessels to contain Christ. In chapter ten these vessels have a mouth to call on the Lord to be filled with Him. To call, "O Lord Jesus," is not just the way of salvation but the way to take in the Lord Jesus as our all.</P><P>Our concept is to improve our behavior so that we can be a good person. The Bible, however, tells us that we need to eat Jesus and live by Him. Romans 8 talks about walking, Romans 9 talks about the vessels needing to be filled up, and Romans 10 tells us that the way for us as vessels to be filled up is to open up our mouth to call on the Lord and receive all the riches of Christ. The Lord is rich to all that call upon Him.</P><P>Christ is the embodiment of all the fullness of the Godhead (Col. 2:9). All the fullness of what God is dwells in Christ for us to receive. He became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace (John 1:14). Of His fullness we all have received, and grace upon grace (v. 16). We have to receive Christ, not once for all but constantly. Day by day we have to receive Christ for our growth, and growth is for building.</P><P>Many Christians do not care for eating. Instead, they care for exercising their mind to study. In the Lord's recovery, however, we care only for eating. If you argue about what is on the menu and do not eat, you will either be undernourished or starve. We are not here to debate over doctrines. We are here to eat God's word in the Bible. Man lives by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God (Matt. 4:4). God's word is our food.</P><P>My main burden in this chapter is to help us realize that we need to take Jesus more and more into us. Do not be bothered by your losing of your temper. Do not be bothered about how to deal with your spouse. Forget about that. Learn to be a good eater. Eat Christ. Every morning take a good portion of Christ. The Cantonese have seven meals a day. We have to be "Cantonese Christians" who eat Christ many times throughout the day. We need seven meals a day to eat Christ. When our spouse bothers us, that should be a reminder that we need another meal of Christ. The Christian life is not a matter of behaving but a matter of eating.</P><P>Our functioning in the meetings is the issue of our eating Christ. The leading ones in the churches may be very anxious about all the saints functioning in the meetings. They may even tell the saints to raise their hands and promise that they will function in the meetings. This is the wrong way to help the saints function. If we charge people to function and ask them to promise us to function, eventually they still will not function. They do not function, because they have nothing with which to function. Asking the saints to function is like saying, "Promise me that in the next meeting you will spend two hundred dollars." In the next meeting they cannot do this, because they have only a nickel. How could they spend two hundred dollars? The leading brothers in the local churches do not need to charge the saints to do anything. Just feed them. If you feed the saints throughout the week and help them to eat Christ, they will be filled with the riches of Christ. Then everyone will come to the meeting with a thousand dollars. The church life is not a matter of endeavoring to function but a matter of eating. Why is the church meeting poor? Because all the attendants are starved to death. We all have to help one another to eat.</P><P>First, we have to realize that Christ, the heavenly food, is in our spirit. He is not here to teach and instruct us. He wants us to come and dine. Eventually, we find out what we should do by the One whom we eat. Learn to eat Jesus. Do not try to do anything. Do not try to improve yourself. We are not doers; we are eaters. We are not mourners; we are eaters. We are not performers; we are eaters. Only a good eater of Jesus can be the best wife or husband. In every situation, never try to do anything. Whatever transpires, just go to eat Jesus, who is in your spirit. We can turn from the flesh to Jesus in our spirit. He is always available for us to enjoy.</P><P>If we eat Jesus in the mornings, we will have plenty to offer to the saints in the meeting in the evenings. In the ancient times, the Israelites labored on the good land day by day. Then they had a lot to bring to God for their worship. They brought all the riches of the good land to offer to God, and they mutually enjoyed these riches in the presence of God (Deut. 14:23). Their worship was a worship of eating the riches of the good land, which are a type of the riches of Christ. Today if we eat Jesus throughout the week, we will have plenty of the riches of Christ to offer to others in the meetings. When we pray or speak something in the meetings, that will be an overflow of the riches we have inwardly enjoyed. This should be our worship in the church meetings.</P><P>Whatever happens to us, we should not be troubled, bothered, or disappointed. No matter what happens or what your situation is, try to eat Jesus. Learn to eat. We eat by exercising our spirit to contact the indwelling Christ who is one with us in our spirit. We should not be bothered by any trouble that comes to us. Simply go to eat the Lord. We can say, "Lord, You know that this trouble has come to me. Now is the time for me to eat You more." Often when we have a good situation, we do not eat. Our bad situations cause us to eat Jesus more. Learn to take Jesus in all your situations.</P><P>If we want to minister the word to the saints in the meetings, we need to eat Jesus. Are you going to speak? Before you speak, eat Jesus. What we need is to eat Him. God's intention is to work Christ into you, to add Christ into you, day by day for your growth in life. Our growth in life is inadequate. We all need more growth. Otherwise, the Lord's recovery will become a movement. We do not want to have a movement of work, activity, programs, and schedules without life. We hate that. We like to see all the dear saints in the Lord's recovery taking Christ, digesting Christ, experiencing Christ, and growing with Christ.</P><P>The church life is not a testimony of behavior, but a testimony of what we are, and what we are comes from what we eat. If we eat Jesus, we are Jesus, and we become the real testimony of Jesus. This testimony is the Lord's recovery. We all have to pray, to look to the Lord, that He would open our eyes that we may see what He really wants and what we really need. We need to eat Him.</P><P>We have seen that we have the bothering flesh, but this flesh helps us to turn to Christ in our spirit. The Lord Jesus today is the life-giving Spirit in our spirit. We are one spirit with Him and can never exhaust the supply of such a bountiful store of grace. Now we must spend our time and concentrate ourselves on eating Jesus. Then we will grow with Him, and our growth is building. First, the building will be revealed in our family. Second, this building will be revealed among the brothers and sisters. Eventually, this building will be fully revealed in the church life. We all are one in the growth of life, and this growth of life is simply Christ assimilated and added into our being. This is real. It is not a mere doctrine or an ethical teaching. Christ is the life-giving Spirit in our spirit for us to enjoy as our supply day by day.</P></body></html>
