<P>But some may argue by saying, "Brother Lee, didn't you say that the administration of the churches should be local and independent?" I may have said that many years ago, but if you asked me to repeat such a saying today, I would not do it. We may think that the local churches are independent, but in the Bible I cannot find the thought of independence. Who is independent from whom in the Body of Christ? Is the church in Anaheim independent from the church in Dallas? The word independence should not be brought in when we are speaking about the Body of Christ. We are not independent. Instead, we all are dependent on one another. The church in Anaheim depends upon the church in Fullerton, and the church in Fullerton depends upon the church in Anaheim. We are not independent. We are one Body. Are the churches in Taiwan independent from the churches in America? In the Body of Christ, this cannot be.</P><P>The churches may be different in their business affairs, but even in this matter they should not claim that they are independent. What if the church in Anaheim made a decision to meet at two o'clock in the morning? The leading ones there may claim that the local church has its own jurisdiction and that no one can interfere with them. But the church in Santa Ana may ask, "Why have you brothers in Anaheim made such a decision to meet at two o'clock in the morning?" The brothers in Anaheim may say that those in Santa Ana should not interfere with them, that this is not their business, and that the church in Anaheim is independent and has its own jurisdiction. But to meet at two o'clock in the morning is peculiar and odd to the uttermost. In this matter the church in Anaheim needs the helpful advice from the church in Santa Ana. It is not wise to make a decision to meet at two o'clock in the morning. This illustration shows that we need the advice and help from the other churches even in business affairs and practical things.</P><P>There are many times when I am adjusted in my fellowship with the co-workers. The brothers may remind me of something that would change our consideration in certain matters. In this particular conference, we brothers came together before the meetings to pray and fellowship about certain things. Some of the brothers asked me whether or not we needed to meet before the Lord's table meeting, since this meeting would be a little earlier. We felt that there would be no need for us to come together before this meeting. This is the fellowship of the Body. I should not say to the brothers, "This conference is my conference. This is not your business. Don't interfere with my jurisdiction." This would be terrible. But this is actually the practice in some places&#151;if not outwardly, at least inwardly.</P><P>If we claim to be independent, we damage ourselves. We should never forget that God has only one church. The church in Anaheim is just a small part of the church of God. We should not think that there is the church of God plus the church in Anaheim. When we speak of the church of God, we imply the local church. Through the years I have learned the following lesson. The more we honor the uniqueness of the church, the more blessings we will receive. The church in which you are meeting today may be in Spokane or in Anaheim, but we have to remember that these are just parts of the church. They are not independent. We are dependent upon one another. All the churches need the help of the other churches because we are one Body. We have to see the Body.</P>
