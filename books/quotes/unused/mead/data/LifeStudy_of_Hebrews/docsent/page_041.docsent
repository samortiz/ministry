   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE MANY BROTHERS A. Brought Forth in Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As the many sons of God, we are the many brothers of Christ who is the Firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He was born to be the Firstborn Son of God through His resurrection Acts 13:33 , and we have been produced to be His many brothers in His resurrection 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It was after His resurrection that He called His disciples His brothers John 20:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our new birth was not a physical birth but a birth in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>B. Having the Firstborn Son of God</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>as the Elder Brother</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We, the many sons of God, have the Firstborn Son as our elder Brother Heb 2:11; Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As our elder Brother, He is our model and our example.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because He is our elder Brother, He takes the lead in everything, and we have to follow in His footsteps.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>C. Having the Same Life and Nature</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>as the Firstborn Son of God</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As the many sons of God, we have the same life and nature as the Firstborn Son of God 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since we share the same life and nature as He, we are His many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because we have the life and nature of God, we are God s many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because we share the same life and nature as the Firstborn does, we are His brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To God, we are His many sons; to the Firstborn Son of God, we are His many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE CHURCH A. Composed of the Many Brothers</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>in Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As we have seen, the church is composed of the many brothers of the Firstborn Son of God in resurrection 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because of this, the church is a corporate partnership with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we come to 3:14, we shall have much to say about this partnership.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For the present, it is sufficient that we keep in mind that the church is a corporate partnership.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>B. The Firstborn Son of God Declaring</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>the Father s Name to His Brothers</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the church, the Firstborn Son of God declares the Father s name to His brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because the Father is the source of life and nature, to declare the name of the Father is to show the many brothers the source of life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although the Jewish people in ancient times knew God, they did not know the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They knew God as the Creator but not as the Father who begets.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They knew God s creating power, but they did not know the Father s begetting ability.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They knew God s power, but they did not realize the Father s life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before the resurrection, not even the disciples of Jesus knew the Father s life and begetting ability.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Before the day of resurrection, they only knew as much as the Jewish people did.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, on the day of resurrection the Lord came to them to declare the Father to make them know the Father as the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Bible only mentions this very briefly, but this brief mention is like a little show window through which we can see a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to John 20, Jesus visited His disciples in the evening on the day of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But John does not say that He declared the Father to the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is mentioned prophetically in Psalm 22:22.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to that prophecy, after His resurrection Christ came mainly to His disciples to make the Father known to them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Father s life and nature have become theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Father s being has been transferred into their being.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is what it means to declare the Father s name to the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we had been there when the Lord did this, we would have realized that that declaration was not just a matter of mentioning the name.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>No, it was an impartation of all that the Father is the Father s life, nature, and being into the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It was from this that Peter came to realize that he was a partaker of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He mentions this in his second Epistle 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We, the sons of God, have all become partakers of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To us, God is no longer merely the creating God but also the begetting Father.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He has begotten us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He has imparted His life, His nature, and even His being into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is what it means to declare the Father s name.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>C. The Firstborn Son of God</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Singing Hymns of Praise unto the Father</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>in the Midst of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After declaring the Father s name, the Son sings hymns of praise to Him in the midst of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I do not believe that this prophecy means that the Firstborn Son of God sang hymns of praise to the Father in the church only once.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Rather, I believe that it means throughout all the centuries the Firstborn Son has been continually singing hymns of praise unto the Father in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>How does He do this?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He does it in all of His brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I have the full assurance that right now He is inside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Since He is in us, He sings praises unto the Father in our singing.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>His singing is in our singing.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When we sing, He sings because He is within our singing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When we sing hymns to the Father from our spirit, He sings with us in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The church on earth today is one corporate Body with the Firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the meetings of the church, the Firstborn Son of God sings praise to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Whenever we come to the meetings, we must open our mouths to praise the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we do this immediately, we cooperate with the indwelling Firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Do you want to gain more of the Firstborn Son?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If you do, you need to praise the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The more we praise the Father, the more we gain the Firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The more we sing, the more He sings in our singing.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The best way to have Christ work together with us is by singing praises to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>According to our experiences, many of us can testify that this is so.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In some of the church meetings we did much singing to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>That was the time when we enjoyed Christ so much.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We even had the sensation that He was singing in our singing.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Christ has made the Father known to us as the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Now in all the church meetings He is waiting for the opportunity to cooperate with us in singing praises to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The best way for us to give Him this cooperation is to open our spirit and sing praise to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The more we sing, the more we shall enjoy His singing.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When we praise the Father, we enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We are one with Christ in praising the Father in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The more we praise the Father in the church meetings, the more He praises the Father in our praising, and the more we enjoy Him and gain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The church is composed of the many sons of God who are the many brothers of Christ in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It is a corporate partnership with Christ, the Firstborn Son of God, to participate in the Father s life, nature, and being.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In the church, the Father is praised by His Firstborn Son within His many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Now we have seen something regarding the many sons, the many brothers, and the church.</S>
