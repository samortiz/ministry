They considered all Gentiles to be dogs and pigs. If you were to give money to the poor among the Jews, they would not take it. They considered themselves to be the only people who were chosen of God. Their racial consciousness was extremely strong. It was impossible to make Jews and Greeks one. But after they believed in Christ and received Him, they entered into the baptismal water. The part that distinguished Jews as Jews could not come out; only the part which is Christ could come out. Baptism is a test; it shows whether a person is in Christ or not. Do you still hold onto your national distinctions? Do you still hold onto the distinction between slaves and free men? At the time of the Roman Empire, slaves did not have any freedom. There was a vast difference between slaves and free men. Yet all those who are baptized into Christ have become one in Christ. There are no more distinctions between the nationalities and races and between slaves and free men.</p><h2 class="head1">NO SLAVES OR FREE MEN</h2><p>In Shanghai a brother works for me as my cook. At home I call him by his name, but in the meetings I call him a brother. Once I asked him to come to me. He said, "Mr. Nee..." I interrupted him and said, "In Christ there cannot be servants and masters. You should not call me, `Mister'; you should call me, `Brother.'" There was a sister in Shanghai who had an unsaved husband. The winter before last, they decided to pray to the Lord. The wife prayed first, and then the husband also prayed and became a member in the Lord. I told the husband when he was baptized that from the time they were married until this day, they were husband and wife; however, from this night forward, their relationship in Adam was terminated. They had become one in Christ. Once I met a brother in Canada, and I asked if his father was saved. He told me that his father was a brother and that they had become one in Christ. In another meeting, I had to stand up to introduce my uncle, and I called him my brother. In a family, there are different family ties. But in Christ and in the church, there are no family ties. We have all become one in Christ. I have often said that we call our children our children at home, but in the church we call them our brothers and sisters.</p><p>In Kaifeng, Honan province, many government officials believe in the Lord. I was invited once to preach to them. When a local brother introduced them to me one by one, he addressed them as Officer So-and-so. I turned around and told him that we have all been saved from Adam into Christ and that we were all brothers. Two of the brothers were heads of some government departments. Some time ago they came to Shanghai and had a meal with the brothers. A brother was about to address them as Officer So-and-so, but when he saw me, he corrected himself immediately and said, "I am sorry. I made a mistake. They are Brother So-and-so." Hallelujah! Through death we have been delivered from Adam, and through resurrection, we have entered into Christ. In Christ we are all God's sons and dear brothers to one another.</p><h2 class="head1">NO MALE OR FEMALE</h2><p>In Christ there is also no distinction between male and female. The Bible only speaks of God's sons. Sisters, what are you? Through God's only begotten Son, you have all become sons. In the flesh you are female, but you have received the life of God's Son. This life is the life of the Son. Therefore, even the sisters are sons. A brother once said that the brothers should be called male brothers and the sisters female brothers. This is right. Second Corinthians 6:18 says that we are sons and daughters of God, but this portion is not talking about our relationship in Christ. Hence, there is no contradiction between that portion of the word and Galatians 3:28. We are all sons of God in Christ, and there cannot be male or female. This is a glorious fact.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_052.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_054.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 42: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (2) &nbsp; pg 53</div><br></body></html>
