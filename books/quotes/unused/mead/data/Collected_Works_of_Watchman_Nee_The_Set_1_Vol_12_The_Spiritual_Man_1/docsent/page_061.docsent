   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In creation, the first step of the word of God was to separate the light from the dark.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Likewise, the word of God now works as a sharp sword inside of us through the Holy Spirit to distinguish the spirit from the soul, so that the dwelling place of the most noble God can be completely separated from base feelings, and we may know how much our soul should submit to the One who is above.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This causes us to know how the spirit is the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit of God and how the soul with all its power is to move not by itself, but according to the will of the Holy Spirit manifested through the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the past the priests used knives to cut open the sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today's High Priest employs the word of God to divide the soul from the spirit of the believer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The knife of the priest of old was very sharp.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It could cut open the sacrifice into two halves.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It could even pierce and divide the joints and marrow, parts which are so solidly jointed together.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now the word of God used by the Lord Jesus is sharper than the two-edged sword.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, it can clearly divide the most intimate parts in man, the soul and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The word of God is "living" having the living power; "operative" capable of doing work; and "sharper than any two-edged sword" able to pierce into the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The word of God can pierce deeper than the soul, even to the innermost part, the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, the believers are led into what is much deeper than the feeling, into the eternal spirit-life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If a believer wants to have a steady life in God, he needs to understand what is the meaning of piercing into the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Only the Holy Spirit can teach the believers what the soul-life is and what the spirit-life is.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the believer can distinguish the two in experience and know their value, he leaves that superficial and shallow life of emotion behind and comes to gain the deep, solid, spiritual one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Only then can the believer have rest.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The soul-life will never give rest to people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nevertheless, this has to be realized from experience.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Otherwise, the understanding in the mind only makes the believers more soulish.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should pay special attention to the words "piercing" and "dividing."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The word of God pierces or penetrates into the soul and the spirit so that they become divided.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the Lord Jesus was crucified, His hands, His feet, and His side were pierced.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Are we willing to let the cross work in our soul and spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The soul of Mary was pierced Luke 2:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although her "son" was given by God, she had to give Him up and give up all her right and demand for a son.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>She had to reject every natural love.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>She had to rid herself of all the attachments in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the kind of work that the word of God should do in us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The dividing of soul and spirit is not only the separating of soul and spirit, but the dividing of the soul itself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The dividing of the soul is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the word of life is to reach to our spirit, it has to divide the soul first, for the spirit is surrounded by the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The word of the cross pierces and divides the soul and opens the way for the life of God to get into the life of the spirit and free the spirit from the bondage of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The soul-life, having the imprint of the cross, will then keep its submissive position to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the soul is not the "thoroughfare" for the spirit, it becomes fetters to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The soul and the spirit never agree on anything.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the spirit has not attained the supreme position, they will often war against each other.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The spirit strives to gain freedom and authority, but the strong soul-life tries its best to suppress it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, when the soul-life has been worked upon by the cross, the spirit is set free.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If the believer does not see the harm done by the soul in not being one with the spirit or in not being willing to be rid of the pleasure of living by feeling, he cannot progress easily.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As long as the encirclement of the soul is not removed, the life of the spirit cannot be free.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After we carefully read the teaching in this passage of the Bible, we know that the spirit is separated from the soul in a believer by means of two things: 1 the cross, and 2 the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The sacrifice has to be laid upon the altar; then the priest can use the knife to divide the sacrifice into two halves.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We know that the altar in the Old Testament is just the cross in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, if the believers are not willing to come to the foundation of the cross and be put to death, they cannot expect their High Priest to divide their soul and spirit with the sharp sword of God, that is, the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Laying on the altar comes first, then the dividing by the knife.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, the believers have to come to the place of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Only then can they expect the Lord Jesus to fulfill His duty as the High Priest, to divide the soul and spirit of the believers with His word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, the believers who desire to gain the experience of the dividing of soul and spirit should hear the voice of the Lord calling them to Golgotha to lay themselves on the altar without any reluctance and trust their High Priest to cut open and divide their soul and spirit with His sharp sword.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The believers' place today, as those offering a well-accepted offering to God, is on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then it is the job of the Priest to use the knife to divide.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Believers should fulfill the condition of their side and trust the rest of the experience to the hands of their faithful High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In due time He will surely let them have a complete spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have seen how the Lord is calling us to come to the cross and put our soul-life to death.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we do not put ourselves on the altar, our High Priest has no way to divide our soul and spirit with His sharp knife.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should be willing to let the cross work; then we can have our High Priest work for us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should follow the example of our Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When He died, He poured out His soul-life unto death Isa 53:12 , yet He gave His spirit to God Luke 23:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What He did then is what we should do now.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The soul-life has to die.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we truly pour out our soul-life and also commit our spirit to God, we shall see before long that God will make known to us what is the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the glory of resurrection there is the complete spiritual life.</S>
