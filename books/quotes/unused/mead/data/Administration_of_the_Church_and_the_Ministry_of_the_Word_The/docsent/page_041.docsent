   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BUILDING OF THE TEMPLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING THE BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To build the church, the Body of Christ, is a general expression in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A more specific and definite expression is to build up the temple and the city.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The emphasis of the temple is on God s presence, the mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, to build up the temple is to build up the mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First Corinthians 6:19 says, Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are God s temple, and God s Spirit dwells within us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The temple is a matter of God mingling with man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After the temple was built, the glory of Jehovah filled the whole temple 1 Kings 8:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This temple signifies the children of Israel becoming God s dwelling place; God dwelt among them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the administration of the church and the ministry of the word we are building up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are building the mingling of God and man into people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The purpose of the administration of the church is to produce the mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The purpose of our ministering the word is also to produce the mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we produce the mingling of God and man, we are building up the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This principle can be applied to many situations.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There may be two brothers who live together but cannot get along.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They do not quarrel and are polite, but there is no building.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I may ask, Is God s presence with them?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Is God s temple there?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If there is no building between them, they do not have God s presence or the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They are independent persons, neither of whom cares for the affairs of the other.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They are simply two brothers who serve the Lord together and who live in the same house.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They do not have God s presence, His temple.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we have been built and have learned the lesson of building, we will realize that these brothers are lacking in the mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They both have a substantial amount of the self, and therefore there is not much mingling with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, our work is to build them up so that Christ can be mingled more with them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to pay special attention to the parts of their being that do not allow them to be mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If they would allow those parts to be dealt with, they would be mingled with God, and God s temple would be in them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The extent of our being joined to others depends on how much we have been mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the building, and it is God s temple with His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whenever we truly render spiritual help to people, we enable them to be mingled more with God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The more they are mingled with God, the more they will be joined to the other members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Those who are short of the element of God cannot be one with other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, the brothers who speak from the podium must be sure that their words will issue in God being mingled more with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we work with young people, the messages we speak should cause them to be mingled more with God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If our messages do not have this result, our work is not a building work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are not building the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A work that builds the temple is a work that allows God to obtain a dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It allows God to dwell in man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our work must cause God to dwell more in man and to be mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE BUILDING OF GOD S CITY</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is a distinction between the temple and the city.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The temple emphasizes a dwelling place, a habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The city is a matter of administration.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, the temple is a matter of presence, and the city is a matter of sovereign power, authority.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the New Jerusalem appears, these two matters will be combined.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The New Jerusalem is a city, which is a matter of authority, and God s tabernacle with men, which is a matter of dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, in the New Jerusalem we see both God s presence and God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although both aspects are combined, the emphasis in the city is on authority.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, the center of the New Jerusalem is the throne of God and of the Lamb, which is a matter of God s sovereign power, God s authority Rev 22:3 .</S>
