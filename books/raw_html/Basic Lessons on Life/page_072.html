<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Of Peace</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Peace within Us<br>Being Entirely a Matter of Consciousness</H2><P>The peace within us is not the peace in the environment. This is the peace within our being. It is entirely a matter of consciousness. We know that there is peace within us by the inner consciousness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Consciousness of Peace Enabling Us<br>to Know That We Are in the Spirit</H2><P>This consciousness of peace enables us to know that we are in the spirit. If we do not have peace, this indicates that we are not in the spirit. If we have peace, if we sense peace within us, this tells us that we are in the spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Of Death</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Death Causing Us to Lose Consciousness</H2><P>Death first causes us to lose consciousness, because a dead person does not have any kind of consciousness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Death Also Causing Us<br>to Have the Sense of Death</H2><P>On the one hand, death causes us to lose our consciousness, to become numb. On the other hand, death also causes us to have the sense of death. The sense of death is the sense of uneasiness, discomfort, depression, oppression, darkness, and emptiness. When we sense these things within us, this indicates death is within us.</P>
