Hence, Jesus is not only a man but Jehovah, and not only Jehovah but Jehovah becoming our salvation. Thus, He is our Savior.

In His humanity He was anointed again in time at His baptism for His ministry, mainly on the earth (Matt. 3:16-17; Luke 4:18-19; Acts 10:38; Heb. 1:9). In His resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45) for the purpose of being God's Anointed, and in His ascension He was made both Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36), becoming God's Anointed in an official way to carry out God's commission, mainly in His heavenly ministry.
