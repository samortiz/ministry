<h2 class=head2>He Is Man</h2><p>This is not all. He is also a man. One day He became incarnated as a man: the Triune God became mingled with man. He is the very God, yet He is a real man, the man Jesus. Do we believe this? If we don’t and yet claim to be Christians, we are antichrist Christians. The real Christian must believe that this Triune God has become a man. He is the Triune God mingled with man.<p>When I was a young Christian, I thought that Jesus was a man on this earth for thirty-three and a half years, but that after His resurrection He was no longer a man. I thought that He put on humanity as a piece of clothing, and that after He died and resurrected, He put off this clothing. Do you have the same thought today? We must realize that He is still a man. After His resurrection, He came to His disciples and showed them His physical body. Of course, this body is one which we cannot fully understand. His resurrected body is spiritual (1 Cor. 15:44); yet it is physical, for He asked the disciples to touch Him.<p>In Matthew 26:63-64, the high priest asked the Lord if He was the Son of God. The Lord answered, “Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.” The high priest referred to the Son of God, but the Lord referred to Himself as the Son of Man. This tells us that after the Lord’s ascension to the heavens, He was still the Son of Man, and that when He comes back in the clouds of heaven, He will still be the Son of Man. He is not only the Triune God, but also a man. Stephen said as he was being stoned, “Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God” (Acts 7:56). He saw the Son of Man! Today, the Lord Jesus is in the heavens as a man. First Timothy 2:5 says, “For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.” John 1:51 shows that even in eternity Christ will still be a man. He is the Triune God mingled with man. Therefore, He is the Triune God-man.<p>Let us add to our first illustration in this way:<p>Christ is God the Son, with the Father, in the Spirit, and mingled together with man. All the fullness of the Father is in the Son; all that is in the Son is in the Spirit; and all that is in the Spirit is in the man. This is the very Savior in whom we believe. This is the very Lord whom we serve. This is the very God whom we worship. This is the Christ who dwells in us as our life!<p>Before the Lord comes into us as life, He has already been mingled with man. He comes into us not only with the divine nature, but also with the human nature. It is so easy for Him to be life to us because He is human as we are. He works within us not in a miraculous way, but many times in a very human way—in fact, so humanly that we can hardly believe it is His work. He is so all-inclusive and unlimited; yet He works in such a normal, ordinary, and human way. He is not only God, but He is God mingled with man.<p>Within this life we have God the Son, the Father, the Spirit, and man. Take a cup of plain water and mix it with tea. Now the water is more than just water. Originally it was water, but now it is water mingled with tea. Before Christ was incarnated, He was God alone, but after His incarnation He is God mingled with man. In Him is not only the divine nature, but also the human nature, the human essence, the human element. He is God, He is the Father, He is the Son, He is the Spirit, and He is man. He is so rich!
