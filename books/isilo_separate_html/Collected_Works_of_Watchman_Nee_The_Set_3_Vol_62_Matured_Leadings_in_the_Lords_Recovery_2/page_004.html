The church has to make arrangements in practical affairs related to the migration. All the brothers and sisters must first be trained. They must be trained in vocational skills, and they must be trained in preaching the gospel. An elephant in a circus may be clumsy at first, but after some training, it can dance and perform.</p><p>We hope that the brothers and sisters will practice coordination in their occupation as well. We hope that all their occupations will be for the gospel. They should coordinate together in their business so that they can make more money for migration and the spreading of the gospel. Students who are studying at school should also coordinate together. I hope that they will learn some lessons now for the gospel's sake so that in the future they can support themselves in a migration. Some of the applicants for migration to Yi-Yang have good educations and high spiritual capacities, but we cannot use them. However, we can use concrete workers. If we have good education but cannot support ourselves, we will present a problem to the migration. A concrete worker can support himself; therefore, he is useful to the migration.</p><p>In order to prepare ourselves for migration, we have to do a few things. First, brothers and sisters who have a burden to migrate for the spread of the gospel must have a practical skill. We may think that such training is very troublesome, but we have to remember the Lord's word that it is more blessed to give than to receive (Acts 20:35). We have to learn to be those who give. We have to learn to work with our own hands, not only to support ourselves but to support others as well. Second, the brothers and sisters must learn to do things properly. If we can do things properly here in Hong Kong, we can do things properly in Chungking. We have to be trained by the church in the way we handle things. We have to learn the secret of preaching the gospel effectively and leading men to salvation effectively. Third, we in the church have to learn to know the Bible. Through the brothers' and sisters' handing themselves over, we have turned the whole church into a school or a clinic; we will give practical training on how to diagnose people. I hope those who have heard this word before will become more and more clear of our way. This is the only way for the gospel to go out.</p><p>From now on, all trainings, including trainings in the gospel, business affairs, and the study of the Bible, are under the leadership of Brother Witness. We cannot live a leisurely and lazy life any longer. Unless some are unable to catch up physically, we want everyone to be on the alert, to busy himself, to gird up, and to catch up. May the church in Hong Kong be like the army of God, a church that moves in military steps (cf. Num. 1&mdash;2). May the Lord be gracious to us.</p><h2 class="head1">A FELLOWSHIP ON THE WORK IN TAIWAN</h2><p>Witness Lee: For almost half a year, I have stayed in Taiwan. Ninety percent of the brothers and sisters who were saved during the past half year had never heard the gospel before and had never touched Christianity. Presently, twelve hundred people have been saved. But one problem with these newly saved ones is that they still do not know the ground and the way of service.</p><p>In Kaoshiung there are over three hundred brothers and sisters. Last year only a few dozen were breaking bread there. There are no so-called workers in Kaoshiung; every brother and sister has a job. They are all quite busy. But the number of saved ones swarms in like a flood because everyone puts in his portion and is trained. In gospel meetings during the past Chinese New Year, over six hundred people received the Lord and left their names. All the brothers and sisters are young.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> </body></html>
