<h2 class="head1">A FEW THOUGHTS ABOUT MIGRATION</h2><p>1) Because the migration of the church is for the gospel, the motive for migrating must match the goal. Migration cannot be done with any other motive.</p><p>2) Those migrating must have a mind to suffer. Without such a mind, it is best not to move, or you will become a problem to the group.</p><p>3) Those migrating must give up their all. They cannot keep anything for themselves and cannot insist on any personal rights. All must be done with the "house" as the center.</p><p>4) The qualification for the responsible ones in each house must center on their spiritual condition. Their ability to manage affairs should not be the criteria for their selection. (It is best if they have both.) Internal unity has much to do with spiritual leadership. Abilities should be channeled under the direction of the houses to meet the various needs.</p><p>Brother Wei</p><h2 class="head1">THE HISTORY OF THE CHURCHES IN WENCHOW<br />AND THE SURROUNDING AREAS</h2><p>Twenty years ago Brother Wang Tian-zuo and Brother Chang Wu-seng went to the first conference in Shanghai and brought the revival fire to P'ing Yang. At that time Brother Wang Yu-ting received the light of the truth and started the Lord's table at Chiaotunmen. This was the first assembly in the Lord's name in Wenchow and the surrounding areas. In the fall of that year, the two brothers and Brother Chang sent a letter of invitation to Brother Chai Ji-ching with Brother Mao Ching-shi from Taishun, and more than ten brothers from Pumen including Brother Su Ti-sheng, Brother Chin Zhi-fang, and Brother Su Jie-min came in one accord to Chiaotunmen for a ten-day conference. The conference was very strong, and there was indeed the supply of life. After the conference, the brothers went to Fanshan, Mazhan, Leejiajing, Channei, and Nansungyang to build up the local churches. When the brothers arrived in Pumen, they met Brother Wu Zheng-zhong. He also received the light and invited Brother Chai and Brother Mao to pass through Fuding on their way back to Taishun. This produced the meeting in Sanjiaocheng and meetings in the Lord's name in the Taishun area.</p><p>In January 1929, a second conference was held. Brother Chen Ching-fa, Brother Huang Li-chuan, and Brother Dai Yun-zhang, who received the light earlier, joined this conference. In the third year, at the third prayer meeting, Brother Lin Wei-zhong, Brother Wang Zhu-you, and Brother Cheng Tseng-yu, all who had previously received the light, joined the rank of the brothers. In the previous three conferences, all felt the presence of the Holy Spirit, and all witnessed the tremendous working of the Spirit. During every meeting, saints cried out in tears to God, asking Him to open their spiritual eyes so that they could see His plan and heart's desire and so that all the believers could arrive at the oneness of the faith.</p><p>In 1931 there was a ten-day conference in Jinxiang. The responsible ones from all the localities and many of the co-workers from P'ing Yang attended it. After this conference, many localities heard the news and were raised up. In 1933 Brother Wang Yu-ting went to Yungjia and Brother Pan Huo-ling was enlightened. Next, Brother Wang Jin-yi went to Rian and Tsengduichun and began meetings in the Lord's name in those places.</p><p>As we look back over the abundant grace received from the Lord and see that there are more than one hundred miniature local churches, we cannot refrain from praising and giving glory to God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. The only problem is that the present situation is not as good as the past. Furthermore, many of the co-workers, such as Brothers Chai Tze-ching, Wang Tian-zuo, Wang Jin-yi, Wang Yu-ting, Chang Ming-hua, Pan Huo-ling, Lee Shu-ren, Chen Ching-fa, Fu Xuan-gao, and Sister Huang Lan-ru, have all left this world to be with the Lord. We who remain are young, weak, useless members who really need the supply of prayer from the brothers and sisters in other localities.</p>
