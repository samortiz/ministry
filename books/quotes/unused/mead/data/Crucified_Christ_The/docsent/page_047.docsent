   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE THIRD MARY DESPERATELY SEEKING THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The one who experienced the Lord's resurrection was also a Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many people followed the Lord but did not love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After they saw that the Lord died and was buried, they all went home.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, there was one among them, Mary, who came early to the tomb while it was yet dark on the day of the Lord Jesus' resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Did she not know that the Lord was in the tomb?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Yes, she knew.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>So why did she still go there?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>She did so because of her love for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>She thought that even if she could not see the Lord, it would still be sweet to see His tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Mary was the first one who discovered that the stone was taken away from the Lord's tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The tombs of the Jews were caves dug out in a hill, and in the caves they put the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Mary saw that the stone was taken away from the tomb and ran to the disciples and told them that someone had taken the Lord out of the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then Peter and John ran to the tomb, but when they saw that the dead body was no longer there, they went back to their own homes.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Mary was the only one who stood outside the tomb weeping John 20:1-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A person who really loves the Lord will love Him to such an extent that he would not care for his own status nor count the cost.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In fact, love that does not confuse you is not real love.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many saints' love for the Lord is too clear and calm, and as a result they do not receive the real light.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the two disciples saw that the Lord was not in the tomb, they went away because they were too calm and too clear.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Mary, however, was there weeping.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As she wept, both light and revelation came.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>While she was weeping, she saw two angels, and then she saw Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord asked her why she was weeping.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thinking that He was the gardener, she said to Him, "Sir, if You have carried Him away, tell me where You have laid Him, and I will take Him away" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>11-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It was at that moment Jesus said to her, "Mary!"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once this voice was expressed, she knew that it was the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the Lord was on the earth, He had called her with that same voice.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The word of the Lord Jesus was so dear and lovely to her.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He said, "Do not touch Me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brothers and say to them, I ascend to My Father and your Father, and My God and your God" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In principle, the Lord's resurrection should not have been seen by anyone, but because Mary was so earnest in her pursuing, the Lord had to appear first to her.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many Christians quote Romans 9:16, which says, "So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many who quote this verse are slothful and loose persons because all those who really know the Lord are determined seekers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only Mary rose up early while the sky was yet dark.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do not think that this was an easy matter.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At that time Jewish girls were supposed to stay home.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It would have been very dangerous for her to run to the tomb early in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If something bad had happened to her that day, the brothers would have said that this sister had lost her protection because she had not submitted to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God will let only those who love Him know His birth, His death, and His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Only this kind of person can experience Christ and know Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Only a "Mary" can know the Lord's death and experience the Lord's resurrection.</S>
