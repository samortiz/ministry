 <h1 class="msg">OUTLINE THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">SPEAKING POEMS<br />
IN THE CHURCH MEETINGS<br />
FOR THE ORGANIC BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd" start="13">
<li>For the greatest profit in speaking poems in the church meetings, we must be familiar with the crucial poems in our hymnal, <em>Hymns,</em> that contain the rich speaking forth of the divine truths, i.e. the apostles&rsquo; teaching.
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>If we want to know the hymnal, we must spend time in the table of contents and discover the riches.</li>
	<li>We have to praise the Lord that we have a Bible and also a hymnal with poems composed according to the truths of the Bible.</li>
	<li>There are hundreds of poems in our hymnal that contain vital points:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The blessing, worship, and experience of the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Spirit.</li>
		<li>The filling of the Spirit&mdash;inward and outward.</li>
		<li>The identification with Christ.</li>
		<li>The experience of Christ.</li>
		<li>The experience of the cross and the resurrection life.</li>
		<li>The various aspects of the inner life.</li>
		<li>Prayer and service.</li>
		<li>The church and the kingdom.</li>
		<li>The assurance of salvation.</li>
		<li>Consecration.</li>
		<li>Comfort in trials and encouragement.</li>
		<li>Spiritual warfare.</li>
		<li>The gospel.</li>
		<li>The meetings.</li>
		<li>The hope of glory.</li>
		<li>The ultimate manifestation.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Concerning the poems that we may speak in the church meetings:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We should know the crucial points of the contents of the hymns.</li>
	<li>We should care for the standard of the hymns:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We can know the standard by sensing the hymns.
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The sensation of a hymn is based upon the thought in the hymn.</li>
			<li>The sensation of a hymn also refers to its taste.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Two examples of the standard of the hymns are as follows:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li><em>Hymns,</em> #19 (not so full of revelation, low) and #18 (full of revelation, high).</li>
			<li><em>Hymns,</em> #70 (low in life, truth, experience, and revelation), #154 (a higher standard), and #152 (the highest standard).</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We should discern the wording of the hymns.
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>A hymn must have the proper thought.</li>
		<li>A hymn must have the proper poetic wording to take care of the rhyme and rhythm.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We should know the tune of the hymns; many good hymns can be killed by a poor melody.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The practice of speaking the poems (see XI):
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Take the words of the hymn as your own words and speak them forth.</li>
	<li>Function in coordination with the other saints in speaking the hymn to release a full message in mutuality.
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Each hymn may be considered as a message.</li>
		<li>Many persons speaking the same hymn speak a complete message for the meeting.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Function as a player on the same team playing with one ball (the poem being spoken).</li>
	<li>Keep a good continuation.
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Speak so that others can &ldquo;catch&rdquo; the &ldquo;ball.&rdquo;</li>
		<li>Speak with complete clauses, phrases, or expressions so that others can follow.</li>
		<li>Take care of the proper connection.
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Keep a good sequence.</li>
			<li>Connect the points in the poem.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Speak in order (without discord or confusion).
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Do not overlap others&rsquo; speaking.</li>
			<li>Exercise to listen to others&rsquo; speaking as well as caring for your own.</li>
			<li>Wait on others.</li>
			<li>Do not &ldquo;fight&rdquo; with one another for an opportunity to speak.</li>
			<li>Speak with one voice.
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) Speaking by yourself.</li>
				<li>2) Speaking with others.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>Refrain from scattered speaking.</li>
			<li>The more clear the speaking is, the more beautiful it is.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Speak in a conversational manner without formality.</li>
	<li>Speak in an informal way&mdash;free but not wild.</li>
	<li>Speak by repeating and stressing the crucial words, phrases, and clauses.</li>
	<li>Speak with different lengths.</li>
	<li>Use the poem to speak a fresh utterance.
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Reading is more according to the letter.</li>
		<li>Speaking may or may not be according to the letter and is free, automatic, and spontaneous.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Look at each other when you speak; do not concentrate on your hymn book.
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>&ldquo;John, &lsquo;Did you know....&rsquo;&rdquo;</li>
		<li>&ldquo;Sue, &lsquo;Our Christ is....&rsquo;&rdquo;</li>
		<li>&ldquo;Brothers, &lsquo;May we all run the race!&rsquo;&rdquo;</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Pay full attention to the way of speaking:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Not too low without loving the saints&rsquo; ears.</li>
		<li>Not too loud to hurt the saints&rsquo; ears.</li>
		<li>Not too slow to exhaust the saints&rsquo; patience.</li>
		<li>Not too fast to puzzle the saints.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Do not do anything to distract others from the flow of the hymn.</li>
	<li>Do everything in a living way, not in a legal way.
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Legality brings in death and deadness; we must stay away from the legal deadness.</li>
		<li>We should try to do everything in a very living way that is flexible and applicable.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Practice staying away from routine, deadness, oldness, and tradition.
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Consider the following illustrations:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Speak a whole hymn individually or corporately, and then sing it individually or corporately (maybe sing or speak the entire hymn again).</li>
			<li>Speak a verse of a hymn individually or corporately, and then sing the verse individually or corporately (maybe speak or sing the verse again before going to the next verse of the hymn).</li>
			<li>Sing a hymn individually or corporately, and then speak it individually or corporately.</li>
			<li>Sing a verse individually or corporately, and then speak it individually or corporately.</li>
			<li>Speak and sing only one verse of a hymn.</li>
			<li>Speak and sing only a few verses of a hymn.</li>
			<li>Sisters speak a verse.</li>
			<li>Brothers sing a verse.</li>
			<li>One saint speaks one line, the rest of the brothers and sisters speak the second line, etc. Alternate to speak the whole poem.</li>
			<li>Proclaim individually or corporately a part of a hymn or the whole hymn as an enlightening message.</li>
			<li>Etc., etc., etc.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>There are at least one hundred ways to speak a hymn.</li>
		<li>Learn not to be redundant&mdash;speaking the poetry the same way time after time.</li>
		<li>Learn to also keep the freshness in your speaking by the continuous exercise of your spirit.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As in the Psalms, have a Selah sometimes while speaking the poem.
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Offer a prayer.</li>
		<li>Speak something briefly from the Word.</li>
		<li>Explain a little.</li>
		<li>Share a short testimony.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Be free in your spirit to speak, &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hallelujah&rdquo;&mdash;1 Cor. 14:16.</li>
	<li>Give a conclusion to the poem sometimes.
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Stress some of the main points of the poem.</li>
		<li>Sum up the entire poem.</li>
		<li>Give a testimony of your experience regarding the content of the poem.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
