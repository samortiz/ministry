<h1 class="title">ENJOYING VARIOUS CATEGORIES<br />
OF WORDS IN THE BIBLE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">PROGRESSING IN OUR PRACTICE OF PRAY-READING</h2>
<p>Many saints acknowledge that pray-reading is simple and practical, and they testify that pray-reading fills them with satisfaction when they touch the Lord. Presently, our practice is in a beginning stage, but as we go deeper and progress further, we will realize that pray-reading is not a rigid matter; there are many details that we need to consider.</p>
<p>The more we practice pray-reading and the more we touch the Lord&rsquo;s word, the more we grow. This fellowship is not based on human imagination, nor is it just a theory; rather, it is based on experiences gained through practice. To pray-read means to turn the word of the Lord into prayer while reading the Bible. Although it is simple to practice, it involves many items. In this chapter we will fellowship about some of these items.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENJOYING THE WORD ACCORDING<br />
TO CATEGORIES OF WORDS IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>The Bible is the word of the Lord, and it provides life as spiritual food to man. It contains many elements. A good meal includes various dishes, such as fish, meat, and vegetables, but cooking a meal is not always easy. For example, simmering meat in a soup or frying it in a pan will produce different results. Different foods also require different cooking methods. Even eating food involves the use of different utensils. Western cuisine is eaten with a knife and a fork, whereas Chinese food is eaten with a pair of chopsticks. Different utensils require different ways of eating. Likewise, there are also many details related to &ldquo;cooking&rdquo; and enjoying the word of the Lord.</p>
<p>The words in the Bible can be categorized in many ways, and we need to consider and digest the riches contained in these words. There is not a single, uniform method that we can use to digest the words in these various categories; rather, we should digest them according to their differences. Just as different types of food require different ways of eating and different utensils, different categories of words in the Bible also require different ways of digestion. This is a general principle. The words in the Bible can be divided into many different categories, but we will cover only a few prominent categories.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning the Lord&rsquo;s Person and Work</h2>
<p>The first category of words in the Bible concerns the Lord&rsquo;s person and work. The Bible reveals the person of the Lord, and it also shows the Lord&rsquo;s acts and deeds, His work. Whenever we touch words in this category, we need to worship, praise, and give thanks. For example, John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,&rdquo; and verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh.&rdquo; These verses speak of the person of the Lord. We need to digest and assimilate these words in prayer through worship, praise, and thanksgiving. We can say, &ldquo;Lord, You are the Word that was in the beginning; You are worthy of our worship. Lord, You were with God, and You are God. We praise and worship You.&rdquo; We need to use words of worship, praise, and thanksgiving to digest the words concerning the person and work of the Lord.</p>
<p>When the Lord ate the bread and drank the cup with the disciples, He broke the bread and gave it to the disciples, saying, &ldquo;This is My body.&rdquo; And He took a cup and gave thanks, and He gave it to them, saying, &ldquo;Drink of it, all of you, for this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins&rdquo; (Matt. 26:26-28). When we read these verses concerning His work, we need to pray with praise, saying, &ldquo;Lord, we praise You. Thank You for giving up Your body for us and for shedding Your precious blood to establish a new covenant so that our sins could be forgiven.&rdquo; We need to turn the Lord&rsquo;s word into prayer with a spirit of worship, praise, and thanksgiving to digest the Lord Himself and to receive Him with His work.</p>
<p>After receiving, we can enjoy what He is and what He has done. The Lord&rsquo;s word is the bread of life, the living water, light, and life for our enjoyment. For example, when we see that the Lord stretched out His hand to touch the leper and said to him, &ldquo;I am willing; be cleansed!&rdquo; (Luke 5:13), we need to say, &ldquo;You are the Lord who is able to cleanse people. I worship and praise You. I receive You as such a Lord into my being. Remove all my uncleanness. Thank You for being willing to stretch out Your hand to touch and cleanse me. Lord, please touch me and cleanse me.&rdquo; This is to enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s person and work. With regard to words concerning His person and work, we need to worship, praise, receive, and enjoy.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_071.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_073.html">Next</a> </body></html>
