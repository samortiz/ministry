<li>The explanation of man&rsquo;s nature&mdash;good or evil
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Through the generations, there have been two schools of thought concerning man&rsquo;s nature. Some say that man&rsquo;s nature is good (Mencius&rsquo; school), but some say that it is evil (Shun&rsquo;s school).</li>
	<li>The self-evidence of man&rsquo;s nature.<br />
	We must ask ourselves whether our own nature is good or evil.</li>
	<li>From our own nature we can see that, although we sometimes have the desire and intention to do good, most of the time our desire to do evil is much stronger.</li>
	<li>Man&rsquo;s good intentions come from God&rsquo;s creation. Man&rsquo;s evil nature comes from Satan&rsquo;s corruption. Here we have to expound man&rsquo;s fall. Many famous scholars in past history found that man&rsquo;s nature consists of both good and evil. The reason is that by God&rsquo;s creation, man has a good element within, and through man&rsquo;s fall and corruption, man has an evil element within.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Man&rsquo;s actual condition
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Although man&rsquo;s nature contains both a good and an evil element, the good has been corrupted by the evil; thus the evil element has become dominant.</li>
	<li>Therefore man&rsquo;s actual condition is that the evil nature overcomes the good nature. It does not mean that man does not have a good nature, but that his good nature is a defeated one. Give some facts to prove this. For example: in your heart you have a desire to respect your parents, yet you scold them; you have a desire to be honest, yet you cheat; deep inside you do not want to gamble, but you still go on gambling; you want to break your ties with your evil friends, but you still live a life of sin with them. This is man&rsquo;s actual condition.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Can the evil nature be changed?<br />
<span class="normal">This paragraph speaks of man&rsquo;s way.</span>
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>All people in past generations, whether they regarded man&rsquo;s nature as good or as evil, insisted upon changing men. Islam, Buddhism, Chinese philosophy, Confucianism, and those Christians who do not really know the way of the Lord, all insisted upon changing men.</li>
	<li>Actually, man&rsquo;s evil nature cannot be changed. Man can change the outward behavior, but he cannot change the nature. Man can change the deed, but he cannot change the disposition. If the change of behavior is not false, it is at best only superficial. Only the change in nature is a real change. But the evil nature can never be changed, so man has never had a real and thorough change.</li>
	<li>Conclusion: it is impossible for man to change his nature.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God&rsquo;s saving way
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s way to save is not to change but to replace. It is not to change the old, but to replace it with the new; not to change the old nature, but to replace it with a new nature.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s saving way is by regeneration. Regeneration gives you God&rsquo;s life.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The way to be regenerated
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Acknowledge that you have an evil nature that is stronger than your good intentions.</li>
	<li>Acknowledge that you cannot change your evil nature.</li>
	<li>Receive the Lord Jesus as the Savior of life. The Lord Jesus is the incarnation of God Himself. God&rsquo;s life is in Him. To receive Him is to receive God&rsquo;s life.</li>
	</ol></li>
