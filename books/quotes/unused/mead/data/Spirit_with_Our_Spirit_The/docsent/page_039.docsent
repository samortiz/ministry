   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God created man in a marvelous way so that man could contact God, contain God, and receive God as life to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Genesis not only tells us that God created man in His image and after His likeness but it also tells us how He created man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, He created a frame for man with the dust from the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then He breathed into this human frame His breath of life 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's breath of life is the highest material that He can use to create anything.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What else is as precious as the breath of God, the breath of life?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And that breath of life from God was breathed into the human frame.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What a wonderful thing!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After the breath of life entered into man's frame, it became a part of his human constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We were constituted firstly with the dust outwardly and secondly with the breath of God inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The outward frame is man's body, and the inward breath of life has become man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Man's body and man's spirit came together to produce a living soul Gen 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The same Hebrew word for "breath" in Genesis 2:7 is translated "spirit," the spirit of man, in Proverbs 20:27.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Job 32:8 man's spirit is in apposition to the breath of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A human being is a soul with two organs.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The outward organ is the body; the inward organ is our spirit, which is the breath of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, in 1 Thessalonians 5:23 we are told that a whole man is composed of spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now in the whole universe there are two big categories of things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first category of things is material, physical.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The second category of things in the universe is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To contact anything physical, you have to use your body, your outward organ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To contact God as the Spirit with all the spiritual things, you have to use your spirit, your inward organ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the modern culture of today's world, people mostly care for the physical things and neglect the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But the Bible uplifts the spiritual things and depreciates the physical things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Bible even tells us that we need to put to death the practices of our body Rom 8:13 and take care of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have to uplift our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a human being lives by the body, he is very mean, like a beast.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if a human being lives by the spirit, he is very high, higher than the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many unbelievers live in a very low way by their body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Most of them do not know their spirit, but some know one part of their spirit, that is, their human conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some among them live according to their conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is to live partly by the spirit, so these people are higher.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today we believers are charged to deny ourselves, our soul, and to put to death the practices of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then we live by the spirit, walk by the spirit, and do everything according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Romans 8:4 says that we need to walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now we want to see the importance of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the whole universe, firstly God is important to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God has the preeminence.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Besides God nothing is as important as our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For something to be important means that it is indispensable, that you must have it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>With all other things besides God and besides our spirit, we have a choice.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whether or not we have them is not vitally important.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But we must have God and our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Firstly, God is the Spirit to us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then we have a human spirit to contact God the Spirit, to receive Him, and to contain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He lives in our spirit to be one with us.</S>
