   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD BEING THE ONE WHO KEEPS US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I am not saying that we should forget about the difficult passages in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We will address those passages in the next message.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But there are many positive things which are undeniable.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Not only do we have the prayer of the Lord Jesus and the functioning of the Lord Jesus as our High Priest; the Bible records many other items besides.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our salvation does not depend merely on our believing, but it also depends on the keeping power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is not we who are keeping ourselves, but the power of God that is keeping us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are kept by the same condition that enabled us to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The condition for receiving is the condition for keeping.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is impossible to have one condition for receiving and another condition for keeping.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By grace we received God's salvation; by grace we also enjoy God's preservation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we say that salvation is by grace but preservation is by works, we have never read the book of Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have studied the books of Romans and Galatians many times.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Romans talks specifically about sinners; Galatians talks specifically about believers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Romans says that man cannot be justified by works, and Galatians says that man cannot keep his justification by works.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Romans tells us that sinners cannot trust in works; Galatians tells us that believers cannot trust in works.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Romans tells us that the sinners' justification before God has nothing to do with the law and works; Galatians tells us that the believers' preservation by grace likewise has nothing to do with the law.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Having begun by the Spirit, should we be perfected by the flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Having begun by faith, should we be perfected by the law?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, Romans is for unbelievers and speaks from the angle of unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Galatians is for believers and speaks from the angle of believers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the receiving of grace before God is free, the keeping of salvation before God must also be free.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Bible shows us quite clearly that it is God rather than we ourselves who keeps us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First Peter 1:5 says, "Who are being guarded by the power of God through faith unto a salvation ready to be revealed at the last time."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The last step of salvation is redemption at the coming of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Salvation can be divided into three stages.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The salvation spoken of here refers to our redemption at the coming again of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Through faith we are being guarded by the power of God unto redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Are we the ones who hold fast to God, or is God the One who holds fast to us?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Is it we who keep ourselves, or are we kept by God?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Bible says that it is God who keeps us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The guarding by the power of God implies that if I were to become lost, the responsibility would not be mine, but God's. I speak reverently, that if we were to be lost, more responsibility would fall on God than on us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, we should not have any thought at all that Christians can be loose.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We will talk about this issue in the next few messages.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The problem today is salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Salvation is altogether something to do with God.</S>
