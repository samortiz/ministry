   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A SUPPLEMENTARY WORD 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The book of Romans indeed occupies a special place.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In particular, chapter eight of Romans can be considered the center of the mysteries of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The whole New Testament speaks of God's mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today is the age of the church, the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Actually, it is an age of mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By Revelation 10:7, when the seventh trumpet blows, God's mysteries will be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Old Testament, before John the Baptist came and before Jesus Christ was born, everything was revealed and was not a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Moses' laws, regulations, ordinances, and the types were all revealed and open.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There was no mystery at all.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was not until the conception of the Lord Jesus, that is, the Word becoming flesh, that we have the beginning of the mystery of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The birth of Christ is indeed a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How was He born?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Who begat Him?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>And who was He that was begotten?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All these are mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Moreover, even we who have believed in Christ are mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today we are all sitting here without a special reason, and we are so warm towards each other, singing, shouting, praying, and interceding.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Why do we do this?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All we can say is that this is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you say that you love Christ, how can you love Him if you have never seen Him?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This also is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you say that Christ as the wonderful One is living in you, what do you mean?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All these are mysteries!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, the whole of the church age, that is, the age of grace, is an age of mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>LIFE BEING A LAW</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Romans 8:2 speaks of the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This life is not the human life; neither is it the animal life nor the plant life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the excelling life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the universe, the lowest form of life is the plant life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Higher than that is the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Still higher is the human life, which is the highest form of created life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But above this highest form of created life, there is still God's uncreated life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This life is of the Spirit of life, and this Spirit is a law, which is the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After the Bible was written, it was translated into all kinds of languages on earth, and now everyone can read it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I have studied the Bible since my youth and have studied it for almost seventy years.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the first forty years, I did not understand the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It did not matter how much I read; I could not understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I believe many are like me.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I could only say that there is such a thing in the Bible, but in my mind there was no such thing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Moreover, our created mind does not even have the capacity to understand this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We read the Bible, and we knew about the phrase, "the law of the Spirit of life," but we did not know what this law of the Spirit of life was.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, we cannot say that there is no such thing simply because we do not understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Take our body as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our body is a great mystery to us also.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Once I was staying at the house of a saint in Peking.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At that time, he was the head of the nursing department of the Peking Hospital, the most famous hospital of the time.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He took me to a dinner, and all at the table were senior medical doctors.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>During the conversation, one doctor said, "We cannot deny that, structurally speaking, the human body is too mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is so mysterious that we cannot even explain it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It appears that there must be a Sovereign Lord in the universe."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Science is but the discovery of axioms and laws from the phenomena of the universe through scientific methods.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Through observing the fact that an apple always falls down and does not go up, Newton discovered the law of gravity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I cannot believe that at the time of Paul, Greek science would be so well developed that man knew what a law was.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But Paul discovered a spontaneous and naturally existing law, which he called the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Every time you say: "Lord Jesus, I believe in You; I love You; I receive You," you may not notice anything.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But something happens within you.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Something is added into you.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is Jesus; it is Christ; it is the Holy Spirit; it is also God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Paul said that it is a life and a law.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This law has been recorded in the Bible for a long time, and seeking Christians have read it many times, but seldom can one hear anyone speaking about it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Because the light of the Lord's truth among us has been shining brighter and brighter, we are clearer and clearer concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>About fifteen years ago, I began to speak to people about the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
